# DataForSEO

>[DataForSeo](https://dataforseo.com/) provides comprehensive SEO and digital marketing data solutions via API.
>
>The `DataForSeo API` retrieves `SERP` from the most popular search engines like `Google`, `Bing`, `Yahoo`. It also allows to >get SERPs from different search engine types like `Maps`, `News`, `Events`, etc.

This notebook demonstrates how to use the [DataForSeo API](https://dataforseo.com/apis) to obtain search engine results. 


```python
%pip install --upgrade --quiet langchain-community
```


```python
from langchain_community.utilities.dataforseo_api_search import DataForSeoAPIWrapper
```

## Setting up the API credentials

You can obtain your API credentials by registering on the `DataForSeo` website.


```python
import os

os.environ["DATAFORSEO_LOGIN"] = "your_api_access_username"
os.environ["DATAFORSEO_PASSWORD"] = "your_api_access_password"

wrapper = DataForSeoAPIWrapper()
```

The run method will return the first result snippet from one of the following elements: answer_box, knowledge_graph, featured_snippet, shopping, organic.


```python
wrapper.run("Weather in Los Angeles")
```

## The Difference Between `run` and `results`
`run` and `results` are two methods provided by the `DataForSeoAPIWrapper` class.

The `run` method executes the search and returns the first result snippet from the answer box, knowledge graph, featured snippet, shopping, or organic results. These elements are sorted by priority from highest to lowest.

The `results` method returns a JSON response configured according to the parameters set in the wrapper. This allows for more flexibility in terms of what data you want to return from the API.

## Getting Results as JSON
You can customize the result types and fields you want to return in the JSON response. You can also set a maximum count for the number of top results to return.


```python
json_wrapper = DataForSeoAPIWrapper(
    json_result_types=["organic", "knowledge_graph", "answer_box"],
    json_result_fields=["type", "title", "description", "text"],
    top_count=3,
)
```


```python
json_wrapper.results("Bill Gates")
```

## Customizing Location and Language
You can specify the location and language of your search results by passing additional parameters to the API wrapper.


```python
customized_wrapper = DataForSeoAPIWrapper(
    top_count=10,
    json_result_types=["organic", "local_pack"],
    json_result_fields=["title", "description", "type"],
    params={"location_name": "Germany", "language_code": "en"},
)
customized_wrapper.results("coffee near me")
```

## Customizing the Search Engine
You can also specify the search engine you want to use.


```python
customized_wrapper = DataForSeoAPIWrapper(
    top_count=10,
    json_result_types=["organic", "local_pack"],
    json_result_fields=["title", "description", "type"],
    params={"location_name": "Germany", "language_code": "en", "se_name": "bing"},
)
customized_wrapper.results("coffee near me")
```

## Customizing the Search Type
The API wrapper also allows you to specify the type of search you want to perform. For example, you can perform a maps search.


```python
maps_search = DataForSeoAPIWrapper(
    top_count=10,
    json_result_fields=["title", "value", "address", "rating", "type"],
    params={
        "location_coordinate": "52.512,13.36,12z",
        "language_code": "en",
        "se_type": "maps",
    },
)
maps_search.results("coffee near me")
```

## Integration with Langchain Agents
You can use the `Tool` class from the `langchain.agents` module to integrate the `DataForSeoAPIWrapper` with a langchain agent. The `Tool` class encapsulates a function that the agent can call.


```python
from langchain_core.tools import Tool

search = DataForSeoAPIWrapper(
    top_count=3,
    json_result_types=["organic"],
    json_result_fields=["title", "description", "type"],
)
tool = Tool(
    name="google-search-answer",
    description="My new answer tool",
    func=search.run,
)
json_tool = Tool(
    name="google-search-json",
    description="My new json tool",
    func=search.results,
)
```

## Overview

Data augmentation is a technique used to expand the size and diversity of a training dataset with synthetic data. This is particularly beneficial when dealing with limited datasets, which can lead to overfitting.

It can be applied to multiple types of data through techniques including:
* Text: Synonym replacement, word shuffling, or adding typos can be used to create new variations of text data.
* Images: Flipping, rotating, cropping, scaling, adjusting brightness or contrast, and adding noise can all be used to generate new image variations.
* Audio: Time-warping, adding noise, or pitch-shifting can be used to modify audio data.

In this notebook, we will demonstrate 3 different techniques for augmenting data on text data: synonym replacement, back-translation, and noise injection.


## Getting Started

### Install BigQuery DataFrames

We will augment our data using Gemini for each of these techniques. Since we'll use a BigQuery public dataset, BigQuery DataFrames provides a natural interface to perform bulk LLM request operations on the original data.

Learn more about [BigQuery DataFrames](https://cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/bigframes/latest).


```
%pip install --upgrade --user --quiet bigframes
```

### Restart runtime (Colab only)

To use the newly installed packages, you must restart the runtime on Google Colab.


```
import sys

if "google.colab" in sys.modules:
    import IPython

    app = IPython.Application.instance()
    app.kernel.do_shutdown(True)
```

<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning">
<b>⚠️ The kernel is going to restart. Please wait until it is finished before continuing to the next step. ⚠️</b>
</div>

### Authenticate your notebook environment (Colab only)

Authenticate your environment on Google Colab.


```
import sys

if "google.colab" in sys.modules:
    from google.colab import auth

    auth.authenticate_user()
```

### Imports


```
from bigframes.ml.llm import GeminiTextGenerator
import bigframes.pandas as bpd
```

### Set Google Cloud project information

To get started using BigQuery DataFrames, you must have an existing Google Cloud project and [enable the BigQuery API](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=bigquery.googleapis.com).


```
PROJECT_ID = "your-project-id"  # @param {type:"string"}
LOCATION = "US"  # @param {type:"string"}

# Note: The project option is not required in all environments.
# On BigQuery Studio, the project ID is automatically detected.
bpd.options.bigquery.project = PROJECT_ID

# Note: The location option is not required.
# It defaults to the location of the first table or query
# passed to read_gbq(). For APIs where a location can't be
# auto-detected, the location defaults to the "US" location.
bpd.options.bigquery.location = LOCATION
```

## Load data

We will use the StackOverflow data on BigQuery Public Datasets, limiting to questions with the `python` tag, and accepted answers for answers since 2020-01-01.


```
stack_overflow_df = bpd.read_gbq_query(
    """SELECT
           CONCAT(q.title, q.body) AS input_text,
           a.body AS output_text
       FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions` q
       JOIN `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_answers` a
         ON q.accepted_answer_id = a.id
       WHERE q.accepted_answer_id IS NOT NULL
         AND REGEXP_CONTAINS(q.tags, "python")
         AND a.creation_date >= "2020-01-01"
       LIMIT 550
    """
)

stack_overflow_df.peek()
```

## Synonym Replacement

Synonym replacement involves replacing words in a sentence with their synonyms to create variations of the original text. This helps to introduce diversity into the dataset, which can improve the model's ability to generalize with unseen data. For instance, if the original sentence is "Create easily interpretable topics with Large Language Models", a synonym replacement approach might replace "large" with "big" to create "Create easily interpretable topics with Big Language Models".


```
# Constants
n_sample_dataset_rows = 10  # How many rows to sample for synonym replacement
n_replacement_words = 5  # How many words per input text to replace

# Sample a number of rows from the original dataframe
df = stack_overflow_df.sample(n_sample_dataset_rows, random_state=42)
```

Define a Gemini text generator LLM [model](https://cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/bigframes/latest/bigframes.ml.llm.GeminiTextGenerator):


```
model = GeminiTextGenerator()
```


```
# Create a prompt with the synonym replacement instructions and the input text
df["synonym_prompt"] = (
    f"Replace {n_replacement_words} words from the input text with synonyms, "
    + "keeping the overall meaning as close to the original text as possible."
    + "Only provide the synonymized text, with no additional explanation."
    + "Preserve the original formatting.\n\nInput text: "
    + df["input_text"]
)

# Run batch job and assign to a new column
df["input_text_with_synonyms"] = model.predict(
    df["synonym_prompt"]
).ml_generate_text_llm_result

# Compare the original and new columns
df.peek()[["input_text", "input_text_with_synonyms"]]
```

## Back translation

Back translation is a data augmentation technique used in NLP to artificially expand your training dataset. It works by translating your text data into another language and then translating it back to the original language. This process injects variations into your data due to the imperfections of machine translation.

Here's a breakdown of the steps involved:

* Original Text: You start with your original text data that you want to augment.
* Translation (Round Trip):  This text is then translated into a different language using a machine translation model.
* Back Translation: The translated text is then translated back to the original language.


```
# Create a prompt with the translation instructions and the input text
df["translation_prompt"] = (
    "Translate the input text from English to Spanish. The text may include HTML characters; preserve them in the text.\n\nInput text: "
    + df["input_text"]
)

# Run batch job and assign to a new column
df["input_text_translated"] = model.predict(
    df["translation_prompt"]
).ml_generate_text_llm_result

# Compare the original and new columns
df.peek()[["input_text", "input_text_translated"]]
```


```
# Create a prompt with the back-translation instructions and the input text
df["backtranslation_prompt"] = (
    "Translate the input text from Spanish to English. The text may include HTML characters; preserve them in the text.\n\nInput text: "
    + df["input_text_translated"]
)

# Run batch job and assign to a new column
df["input_text_backtranslated"] = model.predict(
    df["backtranslation_prompt"]
).ml_generate_text_llm_result

# Compare the original and new columns
df.peek()[["input_text", "input_text_translated", "input_text_backtranslated"]]
```

## Noise injection

Noise injection is the deliberate introduction of random perturbations or alterations into training data. The goal is to make the model more robust and prevent overfitting.

Here we will apply a 3-step noise injection approach described in the paper "[Understanding Back-Translation at Scale](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.09381.pdf)" by Edunov et al. (2018)

This process involves:
1. Word Deletion: Randomly removing a percentage of words from the input text.
1. Word Replacement: Replacing another percentage of words in the text with a filler token.
1. Word Rearranging: Randomly shuffling the order of words, with the restriction that words can't be moved more than a specific distance from their original position.


```
# Constants
delete_ratio = 0.1
filler_ratio = 0.1
filler_token = "BLANK"
swap_range = 3
```


```
# Create a prompt with the delete instructions and the input text
df["deletion_prompt"] = (
    f"Delete words from the input text with probability {delete_ratio}. Preserve all HTML tags.\n\nInput text:"
    + df["input_text"]
)

# Run batch job and assign to a new column
df["input_text_deleted"] = model.predict(
    df["deletion_prompt"]
).ml_generate_text_llm_result

# View results
df.peek()[["input_text", "input_text_deleted"]]
```


```
# Create a prompt with the filler instructions and the input text
df["filler_prompt"] = (
    f"Replace words from the input text with probability {filler_ratio} with this filler word {filler_token}. Preserve all HTML tags.\n\nInput text:"
    + df["input_text_deleted"]
)

# Run batch job and assign to a new column
df["input_text_filler"] = model.predict(df["filler_prompt"]).ml_generate_text_llm_result

# View results
df.peek()[["input_text", "input_text_filler"]]
```


```
# Create a prompt with the swap instructions and the input text
df["swap_prompt"] = (
    f"Rearrange words from the input text no more than {swap_range} words apart. Preserve all HTML tags.\n\nInput text:"
    + df["input_text_filler"]
)

# Run batch job and assign to a new column
df["input_text_swap"] = model.predict(df["swap_prompt"]).ml_generate_text_llm_result

# View results
df.peek()[["input_text", "input_text_swap"]]
```

# Data Extraction and Transformation in ELT Workflows using GPT-4o as an OCR Alternative


A lot of enterprise data is unstructured and locked up in difficult-to-use formats, e.g. PDFs, PPT, PNG, that are not optimized for use with LLMs or databases. As a result this type of data tends to be underutilized for analysis and product development, despite it being so valuable. The traditional way of extracting information from unstructured or non-ideal formats has been to use OCR, but OCR struggles with complex layouts and can have limited multilingual support. Moreover, manually applying transforms to data can be cumbersome and timeconsuming. 

The multi-modal capabilities of GPT-4o enable new ways to extract and transform data because of GPT-4o's ability to adapt to different types of documents and to use reasoning for interpreting the content of documents. Here are some reasons why you would choose GPT-4o for your extraction and transformation workflows over traditional methods. 


| **Extraction**                                               | **Transformation**                                              |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Adaptable**: Handles complex document layouts better, reducing errors | **Schema Adaptability**: Easily transforms data to fit specific schemas for database ingestion |
| **Multilingual Support**: Seamlessly processes documents in multiple languages | **Dynamic Data Mapping**: Adapts to different data structures and formats, providing flexible transformation rules |
| **Contextual Understanding**: Extracts meaningful relationships and context, not just text | **Enhanced Insight Generation**: Applies reasoning to create more insightful transformations, enriching the dataset with derived metrics, metadata and relationships |
| **Multimodality**: Processes various document elements, including images and tables |  |


This cookbook has three parts:
1. How to extract data from multilingual PDFs 
2. How to transform data according to a schema for loading into a database
3. How to load transformed data into a database for downstream analysis

We're going to mimic a simple ELT workflow where data is first extracted from PDFs into JSON using GPT-4o, stored in an unstructured format somewhere like a data lake, transformed to fit a schema using GPT-4o, and then finally ingested into a relational database for querying. It's worth noting that you can do all of this with the BatchAPI if you're interested in lowering the cost of this workflow. 

![](../images/elt_workflow.png)

The data we'll be using is a set of publicly available 2019 hotel invoices from Germany available on [Jens Walter's GitHub](https://github.com/JensWalter/my-receipts/tree/master/2019/de/hotel), (thank you Jens!). Though hotel invoices generally contain similar information (reservation details, charges, taxes etc.), you'll notice that the invoices present itemized information in different ways and are multilingual containing both German and English. Fortunately GPT-4o can adapt to a variety of different document styles without us having to specify formats and it can seamlessly handle a variety of languages, even in the same document. 
Here is what one of the invoices looks like: 

![](../images/sample_hotel_invoice.png)

## Part 1: Extracting data from PDFs using GPT-4o's vision capabilities
GPT-4o doesn't natively handle PDFs so before we extract any data we'll first need to convert each page into an image and then encode the images as base64. 


```python
from openai import OpenAI
import fitz  # PyMuPDF
import io
import os
from PIL import Image
import base64

def encode_image(image_path):
    with open(image_path, "rb") as image_file:
        return base64.b64encode(image_file.read()).decode("utf-8")


def pdf_to_base64_images(pdf_path):
    #Handles PDFs with multiple pages
    pdf_document = fitz.open(pdf_path)
    base64_images = []
    temp_image_paths = []

    total_pages = len(pdf_document)

    for page_num in range(total_pages):
        page = pdf_document.load_page(page_num)
        pix = page.get_pixmap()
        img = Image.open(io.BytesIO(pix.tobytes()))
        temp_image_path = f"temp_page_{page_num}.png"
        img.save(temp_image_path, format="PNG")
        temp_image_paths.append(temp_image_path)
        base64_image = encode_image(temp_image_path)
        base64_images.append(base64_image)

    for temp_image_path in temp_image_paths:
        os.remove(temp_image_path)

    return base64_images
```

We can then pass each base64 encoded image in a GPT-4o LLM call, specifying a high level of detail and JSON as the response format. We're not concerned about enforcing a schema at this step, we just want all of the data to be extracted regardless of type.


```python
def extract_invoice_data(base64_image):
    system_prompt = f"""
    You are an OCR-like data extraction tool that extracts hotel invoice data from PDFs.

    2. Please keep the keys and values of the JSON in the original language. 

    3. The type of data you might encounter in the invoice includes but is not limited to: hotel information, guest information, invoice information,
    room charges, taxes, and total charges etc. 

    4. If the page contains no charge data, please output an empty JSON object and don't make up any data.

    5. If there are blank data fields in the invoice, please include them as "null" values in the JSON object.
    
    6. If there are tables in the invoice, capture all of the rows and columns in the JSON object. 
    Even if a column is blank, include it as a key in the JSON object with a null value.
    
    7. If a row is blank denote missing fields with "null" values. 
    
    8. Don't interpolate or make up data.

    9. Please maintain the table structure of the charges, i.e. capture all of the rows and columns in the JSON object.

Because invoice data can span multiple pages in a PDF, we're going to produce JSON objects for each page in the invoice and then append them together. The final invoice extraction will be a single JSON file.


```python
def extract_from_multiple_pages(base64_images, original_filename, output_directory):
    entire_invoice = []

    for base64_image in base64_images:
        invoice_json = extract_invoice_data(base64_image)
        invoice_data = json.loads(invoice_json)
        entire_invoice.append(invoice_data)

    # Ensure the output directory exists
    os.makedirs(output_directory, exist_ok=True)

    # Construct the output file path
    output_filename = os.path.join(output_directory, original_filename.replace('.pdf', '_extracted.json'))
    
    # Save the entire_invoice list as a JSON file
    with open(output_filename, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        json.dump(entire_invoice, f, ensure_ascii=False, indent=4)
    return output_filename


def main_extract(read_path, write_path):
    for filename in os.listdir(read_path):
        file_path = os.path.join(read_path, filename)
        if os.path.isfile(file_path):
            base64_images = pdf_to_base64_images(file_path)
            extract_from_multiple_pages(base64_images, filename, write_path)


read_path= "./data/hotel_invoices/receipts_2019_de_hotel"
write_path= "./data/hotel_invoices/extracted_invoice_json"

main_extract(read_path, write_path)

```

Each invoice JSON will have different keys depending on what data the original invoice contained, so at this point you can store the unschematized JSON files in a data lake that can handle unstructured data. For simplicity though, we're going to store the files in a folder. Here is what one of the extracted JSON files looks like, you'll notice that even though we didn't specify a schema, GPT-4o was able to understand German and group similar information together. Moreover, if there was a blank field in the invoice GPT-4o transcribed that as "null".

## Part 2: Transforming data according to a schema 

You've extracted data from PDFs and have likely loaded the unstructured extractions as JSON objects in a data lake. The next step in our ELT workflow is to use GPT-4o to transform the extractions according to our desired schema. This will enable us to ingest any resulting tables into a database. We've decided upon the following schema that broadly covers most of the information we would have seen across the different invoices. This schema will be used to process each raw JSON extraction into our desired schematized JSON and can specify particular formats such as "date": "YYYY-MM-DD". We're also going to translate the data into English at this step.

## Part 3: Loading transformed data into a database 

Now that we've schematized all of our data, we can segment it into tables for ingesting into a relational database. In particular, we're going to create four tables: Hotels, Invoices, Charges and Taxes. All of the invoices pertained to one guest, so we won't create a guest table. 


```python

import sqlite3

def ingest_transformed_jsons(json_folder_path, db_path):
    conn = sqlite3.connect(db_path)

Now let's check that we've correctly ingested the data by running a sample SQL query to determine the most expensive hotel stay and the same of the hotel!  
You can even automate the generation of SQL queries at this step by using function calling, check out our [cookbook on function calling with model generated arguments](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_call_functions_with_chat_models#how-to-call-functions-with-model-generated-arguments) to learn how to do that. 


```python

def execute_query(db_path, query, params=()):
    """
    Execute a SQL query and return the results.

    Parameters:
    db_path (str): Path to the SQLite database file.
    query (str): SQL query to be executed.
    params (tuple): Parameters to be passed to the query (default is an empty tuple).

    Returns:
    list: List of rows returned by the query.
    """
    try:
        # Connect to the SQLite database
        conn = sqlite3.connect(db_path)
        cursor = conn.cursor()

        # Execute the query with parameters
        cursor.execute(query, params)
        results = cursor.fetchall()

        # Commit if it's an INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE query
        if query.strip().upper().startswith(('INSERT', 'UPDATE', 'DELETE')):
            conn.commit()

        return results
    except sqlite3.Error as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
        return []
    finally:
        # Close the connection
        if conn:
            conn.close()


# Example usage
transformed_invoices_path = "./data/hotel_invoices/transformed_invoice_json"
db_path = "./data/hotel_invoices/hotel_DB.db"
ingest_transformed_jsons(transformed_invoices_path, db_path)

query = '''
    SELECT 
        h.name AS hotel_name,
        i.total_gross AS max_spent
    FROM 
        Invoices i
    JOIN 
        Hotels h ON i.hotel_id = h.hotel_id
    ORDER BY 
        i.total_gross DESC
    LIMIT 1;
    '''

results = execute_query(db_path, query)
for row in results:
    print(row)
```

    ('Citadines Michel Hamburg', 903.63)
    

To recap in this cookbook we showed you how to use GPT-4o for extracting and transforming data that would otherwise be inaccessible for data analysis. If you don't need these workflows to happen in real-time, you can take advantage of OpenAI's BatchAPI to run jobs asynchronously at a much lower cost!

# Generate Synthetic Data

Synthetic data is artificially generated data, rather than data collected from real-world events. It's used to simulate real data without compromising privacy or encountering real-world limitations. 

Benefits of Synthetic Data:

1. **Privacy and Security**: No real personal data at risk of breaches.
2. **Data Augmentation**: Expands datasets for machine learning.
3. **Flexibility**: Create specific or rare scenarios.
4. **Cost-effective**: Often cheaper than real-world data collection.
5. **Regulatory Compliance**: Helps navigate strict data protection laws.
6. **Model Robustness**: Can lead to better generalizing AI models.
7. **Rapid Prototyping**: Enables quick testing without real data.
8. **Controlled Experimentation**: Simulate specific conditions.
9. **Access to Data**: Alternative when real data isn't available.

Note: Despite the benefits, synthetic data should be used carefully, as it may not always capture real-world complexities.

## Quickstart

In this notebook, we'll dive deep into generating synthetic medical billing records using the `langchain` library. This tool is particularly useful when you want to develop or test algorithms but don't want to use real patient data due to privacy concerns or data availability issues.

### Setup
First, you'll need to have the `langchain` library installed, along with its dependencies. Since we're using the OpenAI generator chain, we'll install that as well. Since this is an experimental library, we'll need to include `langchain_experimental` in our installation. We'll then import the necessary modules.


```python
%pip install --upgrade --quiet  langchain langchain_experimental langchain-openai
```


```python
import getpass
import os

if "OPENAI_API_KEY" not in os.environ:
    os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("Enter your OpenAI API key: ")
```


```python
from langchain.prompts import FewShotPromptTemplate, PromptTemplate
from langchain_experimental.tabular_synthetic_data.openai import (
    OPENAI_TEMPLATE,
    create_openai_data_generator,
)
from langchain_experimental.tabular_synthetic_data.prompts import (
    SYNTHETIC_FEW_SHOT_PREFIX,
    SYNTHETIC_FEW_SHOT_SUFFIX,
)
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from pydantic import BaseModel
```

## 1. Define Your Data Model
Every dataset has a structure or a "schema". The `MedicalBilling` class below serves as our schema for the synthetic data. By defining this, we're informing our synthetic data generator about the shape and nature of data we expect.


```python
class MedicalBilling(BaseModel):
    patient_id: int
    patient_name: str
    diagnosis_code: str
    procedure_code: str
    total_charge: float
    insurance_claim_amount: float
```

For instance, every record will have a `patient_id` that's an integer, a `patient_name` that's a string, and so on.

## 2. Sample Data
To guide the synthetic data generator, it's useful to provide it with a few real-world-like examples. These examples serve as a "seed" - they're representative of the kind of data you want, and the generator will use them to create  data that looks similar to your expectations.

Here are some fictional medical billing records:


```python
examples = [
    {
        "example": """Patient ID: 123456, Patient Name: John Doe, Diagnosis Code: 
        J20.9, Procedure Code: 99203, Total Charge: $500, Insurance Claim Amount: $350"""
    },
    {
        "example": """Patient ID: 789012, Patient Name: Johnson Smith, Diagnosis 
        Code: M54.5, Procedure Code: 99213, Total Charge: $150, Insurance Claim Amount: $120"""
    },
    {
        "example": """Patient ID: 345678, Patient Name: Emily Stone, Diagnosis Code: 
        E11.9, Procedure Code: 99214, Total Charge: $300, Insurance Claim Amount: $250"""
    },
]
```

## 3. Craft a Prompt Template
The generator doesn't magically know how to create our data; we need to guide it. We do this by creating a prompt template. This template helps instruct the underlying language model on how to produce synthetic data in the desired format.


```python
OPENAI_TEMPLATE = PromptTemplate(input_variables=["example"], template="{example}")

prompt_template = FewShotPromptTemplate(
    prefix=SYNTHETIC_FEW_SHOT_PREFIX,
    examples=examples,
    suffix=SYNTHETIC_FEW_SHOT_SUFFIX,
    input_variables=["subject", "extra"],
    example_prompt=OPENAI_TEMPLATE,
)
```

The `FewShotPromptTemplate` includes:

- `prefix` and `suffix`: These likely contain guiding context or instructions.
- `examples`: The sample data we defined earlier.
- `input_variables`: These variables ("subject", "extra") are placeholders you can dynamically fill later. For instance, "subject" might be filled with "medical_billing" to guide the model further.
- `example_prompt`: This prompt template is the format we want each example row to take in our prompt.

## 4. Creating the Data Generator
With the schema and the prompt ready, the next step is to create the data generator. This object knows how to communicate with the underlying language model to generate synthetic data.


```python
synthetic_data_generator = create_openai_data_generator(
    output_schema=MedicalBilling,
    llm=ChatOpenAI(
        temperature=1
    ),  # You'll need to replace with your actual Language Model instance
    prompt=prompt_template,
)
```

## 5. Generate Synthetic Data
Finally, let's generate our synthetic data!


```python
synthetic_results = synthetic_data_generator.generate(
    subject="medical_billing",
    extra="the name must be chosen at random. Make it something you wouldn't normally choose.",
    runs=10,
)
```

This command asks the generator to produce 10 synthetic medical billing records. The results are stored in `synthetic_results`. The output will be a list of the `MedicalBilling` pydantic model.

### Other implementations



```python
from langchain_experimental.synthetic_data import (
    DatasetGenerator,
    create_data_generation_chain,
)
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
```


```python
# LLM
model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", temperature=0.7)
chain = create_data_generation_chain(model)
```


```python
chain({"fields": ["blue", "yellow"], "preferences": {}})
```




    {'fields': ['blue', 'yellow'],
     'preferences': {},
     'text': 'The vibrant blue sky contrasted beautifully with the bright yellow sun, creating a stunning display of colors that instantly lifted the spirits of all who gazed upon it.'}




```python
chain(
    {
        "fields": {"colors": ["blue", "yellow"]},
        "preferences": {"style": "Make it in a style of a weather forecast."},
    }
)
```




    {'fields': {'colors': ['blue', 'yellow']},
     'preferences': {'style': 'Make it in a style of a weather forecast.'},
     'text': "Good morning! Today's weather forecast brings a beautiful combination of colors to the sky, with hues of blue and yellow gently blending together like a mesmerizing painting."}




```python
chain(
    {
        "fields": {"actor": "Tom Hanks", "movies": ["Forrest Gump", "Green Mile"]},
        "preferences": None,
    }
)
```




    {'fields': {'actor': 'Tom Hanks', 'movies': ['Forrest Gump', 'Green Mile']},
     'preferences': None,
     'text': 'Tom Hanks, the renowned actor known for his incredible versatility and charm, has graced the silver screen in unforgettable movies such as "Forrest Gump" and "Green Mile".'}




```python
chain(
    {
        "fields": [
            {"actor": "Tom Hanks", "movies": ["Forrest Gump", "Green Mile"]},
            {"actor": "Mads Mikkelsen", "movies": ["Hannibal", "Another round"]},
        ],
        "preferences": {"minimum_length": 200, "style": "gossip"},
    }
)
```




    {'fields': [{'actor': 'Tom Hanks', 'movies': ['Forrest Gump', 'Green Mile']},
      {'actor': 'Mads Mikkelsen', 'movies': ['Hannibal', 'Another round']}],
     'preferences': {'minimum_length': 200, 'style': 'gossip'},
     'text': 'Did you know that Tom Hanks, the beloved Hollywood actor known for his roles in "Forrest Gump" and "Green Mile", has shared the screen with the talented Mads Mikkelsen, who gained international acclaim for his performances in "Hannibal" and "Another round"? These two incredible actors have brought their exceptional skills and captivating charisma to the big screen, delivering unforgettable performances that have enthralled audiences around the world. Whether it\'s Hanks\' endearing portrayal of Forrest Gump or Mikkelsen\'s chilling depiction of Hannibal Lecter, these movies have solidified their places in cinematic history, leaving a lasting impact on viewers and cementing their status as true icons of the silver screen.'}



As we can see, the created examples are diversified and possess information we wanted them to have. Also, their style reflects our given preferences quite well.

## Generating exemplary dataset for extraction benchmarking purposes


```python
inp = [
    {
        "Actor": "Tom Hanks",
        "Film": [
            "Forrest Gump",
            "Saving Private Ryan",
            "The Green Mile",
            "Toy Story",
            "Catch Me If You Can",
        ],
    },
    {
        "Actor": "Tom Hardy",
        "Film": [
            "Inception",
            "The Dark Knight Rises",
            "Mad Max: Fury Road",
            "The Revenant",
            "Dunkirk",
        ],
    },
]

generator = DatasetGenerator(model, {"style": "informal", "minimal length": 500})
dataset = generator(inp)
```


```python
dataset
```




    [{'fields': {'Actor': 'Tom Hanks',
       'Film': ['Forrest Gump',
        'Saving Private Ryan',
        'The Green Mile',
        'Toy Story',
        'Catch Me If You Can']},
      'preferences': {'style': 'informal', 'minimal length': 500},
      'text': 'Tom Hanks, the versatile and charismatic actor, has graced the silver screen in numerous iconic films including the heartwarming and inspirational "Forrest Gump," the intense and gripping war drama "Saving Private Ryan," the emotionally charged and thought-provoking "The Green Mile," the beloved animated classic "Toy Story," and the thrilling and captivating true story adaptation "Catch Me If You Can."

## What is a Data Store?

A [Data Store](https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/create-datastore-ingest) in [Vertex AI Search and Conversation](https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder) is a collection of websites or documents, both structured and unstructured, that can be indexed for search and retrieval actions.

Data Stores are the fundamental building block behind [Vertex AI Search](https://cloud.google.com/enterprise-search) and [Vertex AI Conversation](https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/agent-usage).

## Data Store Indexing Time

With each website or set of documents added, the Data Store needs to index the site and/or documents in order for them to be searchable. This can take up to 4 hours for new data store web content to be indexed.

Using the attached example notebook, you can query your Data Store ID to see if indexing is complete.
Once complete, you can additionally use the notebook to search your Data Store for specific pages or documents.

## Limitations

This notebook cannot be used for `Search` applications that use standard website indexing.

# How to debug your LLM apps

Like building any type of software, at some point you'll need to debug when building with LLMs. A model call will fail, or model output will be misformatted, or there will be some nested model calls and it won't be clear where along the way an incorrect output was created.

There are three main methods for debugging:

- Verbose Mode: This adds print statements for "important" events in your chain.
- Debug Mode: This add logging statements for ALL events in your chain.
- LangSmith Tracing: This logs events to [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) to allow for visualization there.

|                        | Verbose Mode | Debug Mode | LangSmith Tracing |
|------------------------|--------------|------------|-------------------|
| Free                   | ✅            | ✅          | ✅                 |

| Runs Locally           | ✅            | ✅          | ❌                 |


## Tracing

Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls.
As these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent.
The best way to do this is with [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com).

After you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces:

```shell
export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2="true"
export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY="..."
```

Or, if in a notebook, you can set them with:

```python
import getpass
import os

os.environ["LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2"] = "true"
os.environ["LANGCHAIN_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass()
```

Let's suppose we have an agent, and want to visualize the actions it takes and tool outputs it receives. Without any debugging, here's what we see:

import ChatModelTabs from "@theme/ChatModelTabs";

<ChatModelTabs
  customVarName="llm"
/>



```python
# | output: false
# | echo: false

from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4-turbo", temperature=0)
```


```python
from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor, create_tool_calling_agent
from langchain_community.tools.tavily_search import TavilySearchResults
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

tools = [TavilySearchResults(max_results=1)]
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [
        (
            "system",
            "You are a helpful assistant.",
        ),
        ("placeholder", "{chat_history}"),
        ("human", "{input}"),
        ("placeholder", "{agent_scratchpad}"),
    ]
)

# Construct the Tools agent
agent = create_tool_calling_agent(llm, tools, prompt)

# Create an agent executor by passing in the agent and tools
agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools)
agent_executor.invoke(
    {"input": "Who directed the 2023 film Oppenheimer and what is their age in days?"}
)
```




    {'input': 'Who directed the 2023 film Oppenheimer and what is their age in days?',
     'output': 'The 2023 film "Oppenheimer" was directed by Christopher Nolan.\n\nTo calculate Christopher Nolan\'s age in days, we first need his birthdate, which is July 30, 1970. Let\'s calculate his age in days from his birthdate to today\'s date, December 7, 2023.\n\n1. Calculate the total number of days from July 30, 1970, to December 7, 2023.\n2. Nolan was born on July 30, 1970. From July 30, 1970, to July 30, 2023, is 53 years.\n3. From July 30, 2023, to December 7, 2023, is 130 days.\n\nNow, calculate the total days:\n- 53 years = 53 x 365 = 19,345 days\n- Adding leap years from 1970 to 2023: There are 13 leap years (1972, 1976, 1980, 1984, 1988, 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, 2020). So, add 13 days.\n- Total days from years and leap years = 19,345 + 13 = 19,358 days\n- Add the days from July 30, 2023, to December 7, 2023 = 130 days\n\nTotal age in days = 19,358 + 130 = 19,488 days\n\nChristopher Nolan is 19,488 days old as of December 7, 2023.'}



We don't get much output, but since we set up LangSmith we can easily see what happened under the hood:

## `set_debug` and `set_verbose`

If you're prototyping in Jupyter Notebooks or running Python scripts, it can be helpful to print out the intermediate steps of a chain run.

There are a number of ways to enable printing at varying degrees of verbosity.

Note: These still work even with LangSmith enabled, so you can have both turned on and running at the same time


### `set_verbose(True)`

Setting the `verbose` flag will print out inputs and outputs in a slightly more readable format and will skip logging certain raw outputs (like the token usage stats for an LLM call) so that you can focus on application logic.


```python
from langchain.globals import set_verbose

set_verbose(True)
agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools)
agent_executor.invoke(
    {"input": "Who directed the 2023 film Oppenheimer and what is their age in days?"}
)
```

However, it is widely known that he was born on July 30, 1970. Using this date, I can calculate his age in days as of today.
    
    Let's calculate:
    
    - Christopher Nolan's birth date: July 30, 1970.
    - Today's date: December 7, 2023.
    
    The number of days between these two dates can be calculated as follows:
    
    1. From July 30, 1970, to July 30, 2023, is 53 years.
    2. From July 30, 2023, to December 7, 2023, is 130 days.
    
    Calculating the total days for 53 years (considering leap years):
    - 53 years × 365 days/year = 19,345 days
    - Adding leap years (1972, 1976, ..., 2020, 2024 - 13 leap years): 13 days
    
    Total days from birth until July 30, 2023: 19,345 + 13 = 19,358 days
    Adding the days from July 30, 2023, to December 7, 2023: 130 days
    
    Total age in days as of December 7, 2023: 19,358 + 130 = 19,488 days.
    
    Therefore, Christopher Nolan is 19,488 days old as of December 7, 2023.[0m

     'output': "I am currently unable to retrieve the exact birth date of Christopher Nolan from the sources available. However, it is widely known that he was born on July 30, 1970. Using this date, I can calculate his age in days as of today.\n\nLet's calculate:\n\n- Christopher Nolan's birth date: July 30, 1970.\n- Today's date: December 7, 2023.\n\nThe number of days between these two dates can be calculated as follows:\n\n1. From July 30, 1970, to July 30, 2023, is 53 years.\n2. From July 30, 2023, to December 7, 2023, is 130 days.\n\nCalculating the total days for 53 years (considering leap years):\n- 53 years × 365 days/year = 19,345 days\n- Adding leap years (1972, 1976, ..., 2020, 2024 - 13 leap years): 13 days\n\nTotal days from birth until July 30, 2023: 19,345 + 13 = 19,358 days\nAdding the days from July 30, 2023, to December 7, 2023: 130 days\n\nTotal age in days as of December 7, 2023: 19,358 + 130 = 19,488 days.\n\nTherefore, Christopher Nolan is 19,488 days old as of December 7, 2023."}

Philosophy professor David Kyle Johnson wrote that \\\"Inception became a classic almost as soon as it was projected on silver screens\\\", praising its exploration of philosophical ideas, including leap of faith and allegory of the cave.[97] The film grossed over $836 million worldwide.[98] Nominated for eight Academy Awards—including Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay—it won Best Cinematography, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Editing and Best Visual Effects.[99] Nolan was nominated for a BAFTA Award and a Golden Globe Award for Best Director, among other accolades.[40]\\nAround the release of The Dark Knight Rises (2012), Nolan's third and final Batman film, Joseph Bevan of the British Film Institute wrote a profile on him: \\\"In the space of just over a decade, Christopher Nolan has shot from promising British indie director to undisputed master of a new brand of intelligent escapism. He further wrote that Nolan's body of work reflect \\\"a heterogeneity of conditions of products\\\" extending from low-budget films to lucrative blockbusters, \\\"a wide range of genres and settings\\\" and \\\"a diversity of styles that trumpet his versatility\\\".[193]\\nDavid Bordwell, a film theorist, wrote that Nolan has been able to blend his \\\"experimental impulses\\\" with the demands of mainstream entertainment, describing his oeuvre as \\\"experiments with cinematic time by means of techniques of subjective viewpoint and crosscutting\\\".[194] Nolan's use of practical, in-camera effects, miniatures and models, as well as shooting on celluloid film, has been highly influential in early 21st century cinema.[195][196] IndieWire wrote in 2019 that, Nolan \\\"kept a viable alternate model of big-budget filmmaking alive\\\", in an era where blockbuster filmmaking has become \\\"a largely computer-generated art form\\\".[196] Initially reluctant to make a sequel, he agreed after Warner Bros. repeatedly insisted.[78] Nolan wanted to expand on the noir quality of the first film by broadening the canvas and taking on \\\"the dynamic of a story of the city, a large crime story ... where you're looking at the police, the justice system, the vigilante, the poor people, the rich people, the criminals\\\".[79] Continuing to minimalise the use of CGI, Nolan employed high-resolution IMAX cameras, making it the first major motion picture to use this technology.[80][81]\"}]"

# Dedoc

This sample demonstrates the use of `Dedoc` in combination with `LangChain` as a `DocumentLoader`.

## Overview

[Dedoc](https://dedoc.readthedocs.io) is an [open-source](https://github.com/ispras/dedoc)
library/service that extracts texts, tables, attached files and document structure
(e.g., titles, list items, etc.) from files of various formats.

`Dedoc` supports `DOCX`, `XLSX`, `PPTX`, `EML`, `HTML`, `PDF`, images and more.
Full list of supported formats can be found [here](https://dedoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#id1).

## Setup

* To access `DedocFileLoader` and `DedocPDFLoader` document loaders, you'll need to install the `dedoc` integration package.
* To access `DedocAPIFileLoader`, you'll need to run the `Dedoc` service, e.g. `Docker` container (please see [the documentation](https://dedoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/installation.html#install-and-run-dedoc-using-docker) 
for more details):

```bash
docker pull dedocproject/dedoc
docker run -p 1231:1231
```

`Dedoc` installation instruction is given [here](https://dedoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/installation.html).


```python
# Install package
%pip install --quiet "dedoc[torch]"
```

    Note: you may need to restart the kernel to use updated packages.
    

## Instantiation


```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import DedocFileLoader

loader = DedocFileLoader("./example_data/state_of_the_union.txt")
```

## Load


```python
docs = loader.load()
docs[0].page_content[:100]
```




    '\nMadam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and t'



## Lazy Load


```python
docs = loader.lazy_load()

for doc in docs:
    print(doc.page_content[:100])
    break
```

    
    Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and t
    

## API reference

For detailed information on configuring and calling `Dedoc` loaders, please see the API references: 

* https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/document_loaders/langchain_community.document_loaders.dedoc.DedocFileLoader.html
* https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/document_loaders/langchain_community.document_loaders.pdf.DedocPDFLoader.html
* https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/document_loaders/langchain_community.document_loaders.dedoc.DedocAPIFileLoader.html

## Loading any file

For automatic handling of any file in a [supported format](https://dedoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#id1),
`DedocFileLoader` can be useful.
The file loader automatically detects the file type with a correct extension.

File parsing process can be configured through `dedoc_kwargs` during the `DedocFileLoader` class initialization.
Here the basic examples of some options usage are given, 
please see the documentation of `DedocFileLoader` and 
[dedoc documentation](https://dedoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/parameters/parameters.html) 
to get more details about configuration parameters.

### Basic example


```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import DedocFileLoader

loader = DedocFileLoader("./example_data/state_of_the_union.txt")

docs = loader.load()

docs[0].page_content[:400]
```

But most importantly as Americans. \n\n\n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to '



### Modes of split

`DedocFileLoader` supports different types of document splitting into parts (each part is returned separately).
For this purpose, `split` parameter is used with the following options:
* `document` (default value): document text is returned as a single langchain `Document` object (don't split);
* `page`: split document text into pages (works for `PDF`, `DJVU`, `PPTX`, `PPT`, `ODP`);
* `node`: split document text into `Dedoc` tree nodes (title nodes, list item nodes, raw text nodes);
* `line`: split document text into textual lines.


```python
loader = DedocFileLoader(
    "./example_data/layout-parser-paper.pdf",
    split="page",
    pages=":2",
)

docs = loader.load()

len(docs)
```




    2



### Handling tables

`DedocFileLoader` supports tables handling when `with_tables` parameter is 
set to `True` during loader initialization (`with_tables=True` by default). 

Tables are not split - each table corresponds to one langchain `Document` object.
For tables, `Document` object has additional `metadata` fields `type="table"` 
and `text_as_html` with table `HTML` representation.


```python
loader = DedocFileLoader("./example_data/mlb_teams_2012.csv")

docs = loader.load()

docs[1].metadata["type"], docs[1].metadata["text_as_html"][:200]
```




    ('table',
     '<table border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Team</td>\n<td colspan="1" rowspan="1"> &quot;Payroll (millions)&quot;</td>\n<td colspan="1" r')



### Handling attached files

`DedocFileLoader` supports attached files handling when `with_attachments` is set 
to `True` during loader initialization (`with_attachments=False` by default). 

Attachments are split according to the `split` parameter.
For attachments, langchain `Document` object has an additional metadata 
field `type="attachment"`.


```python
loader = DedocFileLoader(
    "./example_data/fake-email-attachment.eml",
    with_attachments=True,
)

docs = loader.load()

docs[1].metadata["type"], docs[1].page_content
```




    ('attachment',
     '\nContent-Type\nmultipart/mixed; boundary="0000000000005d654405f082adb7"\nDate\nFri, 23 Dec 2022 12:08:48 -0600\nFrom\nMallori Harrell <mallori@unstructured.io>\nMIME-Version\n1.0\nMessage-ID\n<CAPgNNXSzLVJ-d1OCX_TjFgJU7ugtQrjFybPtAMmmYZzphxNFYg@mail.gmail.com>\nSubject\nFake email with attachment\nTo\nMallori Harrell <mallori@unstructured.io>')



## Loading PDF file

If you want to handle only `PDF` documents, you can use `DedocPDFLoader` with only `PDF` support.
The loader supports the same parameters for document split, tables and attachments extraction.

`Dedoc` can extract `PDF` with or without a textual layer, 
as well as automatically detect its presence and correctness.
Several `PDF` handlers are available, you can use `pdf_with_text_layer` 
parameter to choose one of them.
Please see [parameters description](https://dedoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/parameters/pdf_handling.html) 
to get more details.

For `PDF` without a textual layer, `Tesseract OCR` and its language packages should be installed.
In this case, [the instruction](https://dedoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/add_new_language.html) can be useful.


```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import DedocPDFLoader

loader = DedocPDFLoader(
    "./example_data/layout-parser-paper.pdf", pdf_with_text_layer="true", pages="2:2"
)

docs = loader.load()

docs[0].page_content[:400]
```




    '\n2\n\nZ. Shen et al.\n\n37], layout detection [38, 22], table detection [26], and scene text detection [4].\n\nA generalized learning-based framework dramatically reduces the need for the\n\nmanual speciﬁcation of complicated rules, which is the status quo with traditional\n\nmethods. DL has the potential to transform DIA pipelines and beneﬁt a broad\n\nspectrum of large-scale document digitization projects.\n'



## Dedoc API

If you want to get up and running with less set up, you can use `Dedoc` as a service.
**`DedocAPIFileLoader` can be used without installation of `dedoc` library.**
The loader supports the same parameters as `DedocFileLoader` and
also automatically detects input file types.

To use `DedocAPIFileLoader`, you should run the `Dedoc` service, e.g. `Docker` container (please see [the documentation](https://dedoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/installation.html#install-and-run-dedoc-using-docker) 
for more details):

```bash
docker pull dedocproject/dedoc
docker run -p 1231:1231
```

Please do not use our demo URL `https://dedoc-readme.hf.space` in your code.


```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import DedocAPIFileLoader

loader = DedocAPIFileLoader(
    "./example_data/state_of_the_union.txt",
    url="https://dedoc-readme.hf.space",
)

docs = loader.load()

docs[0].page_content[:400]

## Overview

### [DeepEval](https://docs.confident-ai.com/docs/getting-started)

DeepEval is an open-source evaluation framework for LLMs. DeepEval makes it extremely easy to build and iterate on LLM (applications) and was built with the following principles in mind:

- Easily "unit test" LLM outputs in a similar way to Pytest.
- Plug-and-use 14+ LLM-evaluated metrics, most with research backing.
- Synthetic dataset generation with state-of-the-art evolution techniques.
- Metrics are simple to customize and covers all use cases.
- Real-time evaluations in production.

### Gemini

Gemini is a family of generative AI models developed by Google DeepMind that is designed for multimodal use cases. The Gemini API gives you access to the Gemini models.

### Gemini API in Vertex AI

The Gemini API in Vertex AI provides a unified interface for interacting with Gemini models. 

You can interact with the Gemini API using the following methods:

- Use the [Vertex AI Studio](https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-studio) for quick testing and command generation
- Use cURL commands
- Use the Vertex AI SDK

This notebook focuses on using the **Gemini model with DeepEval**

For more information, see the [Generative AI on Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/learn/overview) documentation.

### Objectives

In this notebook we will focus on using the Gemini API in Vertex AI with RAGAS
We will use the Gemini Pro (`gemini-1.5-pro`) model for Q&A evaluation.

You will complete the following tasks:

- Install the Vertex AI SDK for Python
- Use the Gemini API in Vertex AI to interact with each model
  - Gemini Pro (`gemini-1.5-pro`) model:
    - Q&A Generation
    - Evaluate Q&A performance with RAGAS

### Costs

This tutorial uses billable components of Google Cloud:

- Vertex AI

Learn about [Vertex AI pricing](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/pricing) and use the [Pricing Calculator](https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator/) to generate a cost estimate based on your projected usage.

## Getting Started

### Install Vertex AI SDK for Python


```

The [Gemini-1.5-pro](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/overview) models are designed to handle multimodal inputs.


```
# Initialise safety filters for vertex model
safety_settings = {
    HarmCategory.HARM_CATEGORY_UNSPECIFIED: HarmBlockThreshold.BLOCK_NONE,
    HarmCategory.HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT: HarmBlockThreshold.BLOCK_NONE,
    HarmCategory.HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH: HarmBlockThreshold.BLOCK_NONE,
    HarmCategory.HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT: HarmBlockThreshold.BLOCK_NONE,
    HarmCategory.HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT: HarmBlockThreshold.BLOCK_NONE,
}

generation_config = {"temperature": 0.0, "topk": 1}

# Initialise the ChatVertexAI model
custom_chat_model_gemini = ChatVertexAI(
    model_name="gemini-1.5-pro",
    safety_settings=safety_settings,
    generation_config=generation_config,
    project=PROJECT_ID,
    location=LOCATION,
    response_validation=False,  # Important since deepeval cannot handle validation errors
)
```

The [Vertex AI Embeddings](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/embeddings/get-text-embeddings) models are designed to convert text to dense vector representations


```
# Load Embeddings Models
embeddings = VertexAIEmbeddings(model_name="textembedding-gecko@003")
```

## Create a local Vector DB
### Load the document


```
# source document
document_uri = "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762"
```


```
# use PyPDF loaded to read and chunk the input document
loader = PyPDFLoader(document_uri)
docs = loader.load_and_split()

# Verify if pages are loaded correctly
docs[0]
```

### Create local Vector DB


```
# Create an in-memory Vector DB using Chroma
vectordb = Chroma.from_documents(docs, embeddings)
```


```
# Set Vector DB as retriever
retriever = vectordb.as_retriever()
```

### Create Q&A Chain


```
# Create Q&A template for the Gemini Model
template = """Your task is to answer questions related to documents.
Use the following context to answer the question at the end.
{context}

Answers should be crisp.

Question: {question}
Helpful Answer:"""

# Create a prompt template for the q&a chain
PROMPT = PromptTemplate(
    template=template,
    input_variables=["context", "question"],
)

# Pass prompts to q&a chain
chain_type_kwargs = {"prompt": PROMPT}

# Retriever arguments
retriever.search_kwargs = {"k": 1}
```


```
# Setup a RetrievalQA Chain
qa = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
    llm=custom_chat_model_gemini,
    chain_type="stuff",
    retriever=retriever,
    return_source_documents=True,
    chain_type_kwargs=chain_type_kwargs,
)
```


```
# Test the chain with a sample question
query = "Who are the authors of paper on Attention is all you need?"
result = qa({"query": query})
result
```

## Evaluation
### Create the evaluation set


```
# Evaluation set with questions and ground_truth
questions = [
    "What architecture is proposed in paper titled Attention is all you need?",
    "Where do primary authors of paper titled Attention is all you need work?",
]
ground_truth = ["Transformers architecture", "Google Brain"]
```

### Run the [Q&A chain](#create-qa-chain) on evaluation dataset 


```
contexts = []
answers = []

# Generate contexts and answers for each question
for query in questions:
    result = qa({"query": query})
    contexts.append(
        [document.page_content for document in result.get("source_documents")]
    )
    answers.append(result.get("result"))
```


```
# Convert into a dataset and prepare for consumption by DeepEval API
dataset = []
for q, a, c, g in itertools.zip_longest(questions, answers, contexts, ground_truth):
    dataset.append({"Question": q, "Answer": g, "Context": c})

# Inspect the dataset
dataset
```

# DeepInfra

[DeepInfra](https://deepinfra.com/?utm_source=langchain) is a serverless inference as a service that provides access to a [variety of LLMs](https://deepinfra.com/models?utm_source=langchain) and [embeddings models](https://deepinfra.com/models?type=embeddings&utm_source=langchain). This notebook goes over how to use LangChain with DeepInfra for chat models.

## Set the Environment API Key
Make sure to get your API key from DeepInfra. You have to [Login](https://deepinfra.com/login?from=%2Fdash) and get a new token.

You are given a 1 hour free of serverless GPU compute to test different models. (see [here](https://github.com/deepinfra/deepctl#deepctl))
You can print your token with `deepctl auth token`


```python
# get a new token: https://deepinfra.com/login?from=%2Fdash

import os
from getpass import getpass

from langchain_community.chat_models import ChatDeepInfra
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage

DEEPINFRA_API_TOKEN = getpass()

# or pass deepinfra_api_token parameter to the ChatDeepInfra constructor
os.environ["DEEPINFRA_API_TOKEN"] = DEEPINFRA_API_TOKEN

chat = ChatDeepInfra(model="meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf")

messages = [
    HumanMessage(
        content="Translate this sentence from English to French. I love programming."
    )
]
chat.invoke(messages)
```

## `ChatDeepInfra` also supports async and streaming functionality:


```python
from langchain_core.callbacks import StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler
```


```python
await chat.agenerate([messages])
```


```python
chat = ChatDeepInfra(
    streaming=True,
    verbose=True,
    callbacks=[StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler()],
)
chat.invoke(messages)
```

# Tool Calling

DeepInfra currently supports only invoke and async invoke tool calling.

For a complete list of models that support tool calling, please refer to our [tool calling documentation](https://deepinfra.com/docs/advanced/function_calling).


```python
import asyncio

from dotenv import find_dotenv, load_dotenv
from langchain_community.chat_models import ChatDeepInfra
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage
from langchain_core.tools import tool
from pydantic import BaseModel

model_name = "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct"

_ = load_dotenv(find_dotenv())


# Langchain tool
@tool
def foo(something):
    """
    Called when foo
    """
    pass


# Pydantic class
class Bar(BaseModel):
    """
    Called when Bar
    """

    pass


llm = ChatDeepInfra(model=model_name)
tools = [foo, Bar]
llm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools(tools)
messages = [
    HumanMessage("Foo and bar, please."),
]

response = llm_with_tools.invoke(messages)
print(response.tool_calls)
# [{'name': 'foo', 'args': {'something': None}, 'id': 'call_Mi4N4wAtW89OlbizFE1aDxDj'}, {'name': 'Bar', 'args': {}, 'id': 'call_daiE0mW454j2O1KVbmET4s2r'}]


async def call_ainvoke():
    result = await llm_with_tools.ainvoke(messages)
    print(result.tool_calls)


# Async call
asyncio.run(call_ainvoke())
# [{'name': 'foo', 'args': {'something': None}, 'id': 'call_ZH7FetmgSot4LHcMU6CEb8tI'}, {'name': 'Bar', 'args': {}, 'id': 'call_2MQhDifAJVoijZEvH8PeFSVB'}]

# Question Answering with LangChain, Deep Lake, & OpenAI

This notebook shows how to implement a question answering system with LangChain, [Deep Lake](https://activeloop.ai/) as a vector store and OpenAI embeddings. We will take the following steps to achieve this:

1. Load a Deep Lake text dataset
2. Initialize a [Deep Lake vector store with LangChain](https://docs.activeloop.ai/tutorials/vector-store/deep-lake-vector-store-in-langchain)
3. Add text to the vector store
4. Run queries on the database
5. Done!

You can also follow other tutorials such as question answering over any type of data (PDFs, json, csv, text): [chatting with any data](https://www.activeloop.ai/resources/data-chad-an-ai-app-with-lang-chain-deep-lake-to-chat-with-any-data/) stored in Deep Lake, [code understanding](https://www.activeloop.ai/resources/lang-chain-gpt-4-for-code-understanding-twitter-algorithm/), or [question answering over PDFs](https://www.activeloop.ai/resources/ultimate-guide-to-lang-chain-deep-lake-build-chat-gpt-to-answer-questions-on-your-financial-data/), or [recommending songs](https://www.activeloop.ai/resources/3-ways-to-build-a-recommendation-engine-for-songs-with-lang-chain/).

## Install requirements
Let's install the following packages.


```python
!pip install deeplake langchain openai tiktoken
```

## Authentication
Provide your OpenAI API key here:


```python
import getpass
import os

os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = getpass.getpass()
```

    ··········
    

## Load a Deep Lake text dataset
We will use a 20000 sample subset of the [cohere-wikipedia-22](https://app.activeloop.ai/davitbun/cohere-wikipedia-22) dataset for this example.


```python
import deeplake

ds = deeplake.load("hub://activeloop/cohere-wikipedia-22-sample")
ds.summary()
```

    \

    Opening dataset in read-only mode as you don't have write permissions.
    

    -

    This dataset can be visualized in Jupyter Notebook by ds.visualize() or at https://app.activeloop.ai/activeloop/cohere-wikipedia-22-sample
    
    

    |

    hub://activeloop/cohere-wikipedia-22-sample loaded successfully.
    
    Dataset(path='hub://activeloop/cohere-wikipedia-22-sample', read_only=True, tensors=['ids', 'metadata', 'text'])
    
      tensor    htype     shape      dtype  compression
     -------   -------   -------    -------  ------- 
       ids      text    (20000, 1)    str     None   
     metadata   json    (20000, 1)    str     None   
       text     text    (20000, 1)    str     None   
    

    
 




Let's take a look at a few samples:


```python
ds[:3].text.data()["value"]
```




    ['The 24-hour clock is a way of telling the time in which the day runs from midnight to midnight and is divided into 24 hours, numbered from 0 to 23. It does not use a.m. or p.m. This system is also referred to (only in the US and the English speaking parts of Canada) as military time or (only in the United Kingdom and now very rarely) as continental time. In some parts of the world, it is called railway time. Also, the international standard notation of time (ISO 8601) is based on this format.',
     'A time in the 24-hour clock is written in the form hours:minutes (for example, 01:23), or hours:minutes:seconds (01:23:45). Numbers under 10 have a zero in front (called a leading zero); e.g. 09:07. Under the 24-hour clock system, the day begins at midnight, 00:00, and the last minute of the day begins at 23:59 and ends at 24:00, which is identical to 00:00 of the following day. 12:00 can only be mid-day. Midnight is called 24:00 and is used to mean the end of the day and 00:00 is used to mean the beginning of the day. For example, you would say "Tuesday at 24:00" and "Wednesday at 00:00" to mean exactly the same time.',
     'However, the US military prefers not to say 24:00 - they do not like to have two names for the same thing, so they always say "23:59", which is one minute before midnight.']



## LangChain's Deep Lake vector store
Let's define a `dataset_path`, this is where your Deep Lake vector store will house the text embeddings.


```python
dataset_path = 'wikipedia-embeddings-deeplake'
```

We will setup OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-small` as our embedding function and initialize a Deep Lake vector store at `dataset_path`...


```python
from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.vectorstores import DeepLake

embedding = OpenAIEmbeddings(model="text-embedding-3-small")
db = DeepLake(dataset_path, embedding=embedding, overwrite=True)
```

    





... and populate it with samples, one batch at a time, using the `add_texts` method.


```python
from tqdm.auto import tqdm

batch_size = 100

nsamples = 10  # for testing. Replace with len(ds) to append everything
for i in tqdm(range(0, nsamples, batch_size)):
    # find end of batch
    i_end = min(nsamples, i + batch_size)

    batch = ds[i:i_end]
    id_batch = batch.ids.data()["value"]
    text_batch = batch.text.data()["value"]
    meta_batch = batch.metadata.data()["value"]

    db.add_texts(text_batch, metadatas=meta_batch, ids=id_batch)
```


      0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]


    
    creating embeddings:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s][A
    creating embeddings: 100%|██████████| 1/1 [00:02<00:00,  2.11s/it]
    
    100%|██████████| 10/10 [00:00<00:00, 462.42it/s]

    Dataset(path='wikipedia-embeddings-deeplake', tensors=['text', 'metadata', 'embedding', 'id'])
    
      tensor      htype      shape      dtype  compression
      -------    -------    -------    -------  ------- 
       text       text      (10, 1)      str     None   
     metadata     json      (10, 1)      str     None   
     embedding  embedding  (10, 1536)  float32   None   
        id        text      (10, 1)      str     None   
    

    
    



## Run user queries on the database
The underlying Deep Lake dataset object is accessible through `db.vectorstore.dataset`, and the data structure can be summarized using `db.vectorstore.summary()`, which shows 4 tensors with 10 samples:


```python
db.vectorstore.summary()
```

    Dataset(path='wikipedia-embeddings-deeplake', tensors=['text', 'metadata', 'embedding', 'id'])
    
      tensor      htype      shape      dtype  compression
      -------    -------    -------    -------  ------- 
       text       text      (10, 1)      str     None   
     metadata     json      (10, 1)      str     None   
     embedding  embedding  (10, 1536)  float32   None   
        id        text      (10, 1)      str     None   
    

We will now setup QA on our vector store with GPT-3.5-Turbo as our LLM.


```python
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI

# Re-load the vector store in case it's no longer initialized
# db = DeepLake(dataset_path = dataset_path, embedding_function=embedding)

qa = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm=ChatOpenAI(model='gpt-3.5-turbo'), chain_type="stuff", retriever=db.as_retriever())
```

Let's try running a prompt and check the output. Internally, this API performs an embedding search to find the most relevant data to feed into the LLM context.


```python
query = 'Why does the military not say 24:00?'
qa.run(query)
```




    'The military prefers not to say 24:00 because they do not like to have two names for the same thing. Instead, they always say "23:59", which is one minute before midnight.'



Et voila!

activeloop_token = getpass.getpass("Activeloop Token:")
os.environ["ACTIVELOOP_TOKEN"] = activeloop_token
os.environ["ACTIVELOOP_ORG"] = getpass.getpass("Activeloop Org:")

org_id = os.environ["ACTIVELOOP_ORG"]
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()

```



## 2. Create sample data

You can generate a sample group chat conversation using ChatGPT with this prompt:

```
Generate a group chat conversation with three friends talking about their day, referencing real places and fictional names. Make it funny and as detailed as possible.
```

I've already generated such a chat in `messages.txt`. We can keep it simple and use this for our example.

## 3. Ingest chat embeddings

We load the messages in the text file, chunk and upload to ActiveLoop Vector store.


```python
with open("messages.txt") as f:
    state_of_the_union = f.read()
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
pages = text_splitter.split_text(state_of_the_union)

text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=100)
texts = text_splitter.create_documents(pages)

print(texts)

dataset_path = "hub://" + org_id + "/data"
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
db = DeepLake.from_documents(
    texts, embeddings, dataset_path=dataset_path, overwrite=True
)
```

    [Document(page_content='Participants:\n\nJerry: Loves movies and is a bit of a klutz.\nSamantha: Enthusiastic about food and always trying new restaurants.\nBarry: A nature lover, but always manages to get lost.\nJerry: Hey, guys! You won\'t believe what happened to me at the Times Square AMC theater. I tripped over my own feet and spilled popcorn everywhere! 🍿💥\n\nSamantha: LOL, that\'s so you, Jerry! Was the floor buttery enough for you to ice skate on after that? 😂\n\nBarry: Sounds like a regular Tuesday for you, Jerry. Meanwhile, I tried to find that new hiking trail in Central Park. You know, the one that\'s supposed to be impossible to get lost on? Well, guess what...\n\nJerry: You found a hidden treasure?\n\nBarry: No, I got lost. AGAIN. 🧭🙄\n\nSamantha: Barry, you\'d get lost in your own backyard! But speaking of treasures, I found this new sushi place in Little Tokyo. "Samantha\'s Sushi Symphony" it\'s called. Coincidence? I think not!\n\nJerry: Maybe they named it after your ability to eat your body weight in sushi. 🍣', metadata={}), Document(page_content='Barry: How do you even FIND all these places, Samantha?\n\nSamantha: Simple, I don\'t rely on Barry\'s navigation skills. 😉 But seriously, the wasabi there was hotter than Jerry\'s love for Marvel movies!\n\nJerry: Hey, nothing wrong with a little superhero action. By the way, did you guys see the new "Captain Crunch: Breakfast Avenger" trailer?\n\nSamantha: Captain Crunch? Are you sure you didn\'t get that from one of your Saturday morning cereal binges?\n\nBarry: Yeah, and did he defeat his arch-enemy, General Mills? 😆\n\nJerry: Ha-ha, very funny. Anyway, that sushi place sounds awesome, Samantha. Next time, let\'s go together, and maybe Barry can guide us... if we want a city-wide tour first.\n\nBarry: As long as we\'re not hiking, I\'ll get us there... eventually. 😅\n\nSamantha: It\'s a date! But Jerry, you\'re banned from carrying any food items.\n\nJerry: Deal! Just promise me no wasabi challenges. I don\'t want to end up like the time I tried Sriracha ice cream.', metadata={}), Document(page_content="Barry: Wait, what happened with Sriracha ice cream?\n\nJerry: Let's just say it was a hot situation. Literally. 🔥\n\nSamantha: 🤣 I still have the video!\n\nJerry: Samantha, if you value our friendship, that video will never see the light of day.\n\nSamantha: No promises, Jerry. No promises. 🤐😈\n\nBarry: I foresee a fun weekend ahead! 🎉", metadata={})]
    

    Your Deep Lake dataset has been successfully created!
    

    \

    Dataset(path='hub://adilkhan/data', tensors=['embedding', 'id', 'metadata', 'text'])
    
      tensor      htype      shape     dtype  compression

`Optional`: You can also use Deep Lake's Managed Tensor Database as a hosting service and run queries there. In order to do so, it is necessary to specify the runtime parameter as {'tensor_db': True} during the creation of the vector store. This configuration enables the execution of queries on the Managed Tensor Database, rather than on the client side. It should be noted that this functionality is not applicable to datasets stored locally or in-memory. In the event that a vector store has already been created outside of the Managed Tensor Database, it is possible to transfer it to the Managed Tensor Database by following the prescribed steps.


```python
# with open("messages.txt") as f:
#     state_of_the_union = f.read()
# text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
# pages = text_splitter.split_text(state_of_the_union)

# text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=100)
# texts = text_splitter.create_documents(pages)

# print(texts)

# dataset_path = "hub://" + org + "/data"
# embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
# db = DeepLake.from_documents(
#     texts, embeddings, dataset_path=dataset_path, overwrite=True, runtime={"tensor_db": True}
# )
```

## 4. Ask questions

Now we can ask a question and get an answer back with a semantic search:


```python
db = DeepLake(dataset_path=dataset_path, read_only=True, embedding=embeddings)

retriever = db.as_retriever()
retriever.search_kwargs["distance_metric"] = "cos"
retriever.search_kwargs["k"] = 4

qa = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
    llm=OpenAI(), chain_type="stuff", retriever=retriever, return_source_documents=False
)

# What was the restaurant the group was talking about called?
query = input("Enter query:")

# The Hungry Lobster
ans = qa({"query": query})

print(ans)
```

# DeepSparse

This page covers how to use the [DeepSparse](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse) inference runtime within LangChain.
It is broken into two parts: installation and setup, and then examples of DeepSparse usage.

## Installation and Setup

- Install the Python package with `pip install deepsparse`
- Choose a [SparseZoo model](https://sparsezoo.neuralmagic.com/?useCase=text_generation) or export a support model to ONNX [using Optimum](https://github.com/neuralmagic/notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/opt-text-generation-deepsparse-quickstart/OPT_Text_Generation_DeepSparse_Quickstart.ipynb)


There exists a DeepSparse LLM wrapper, that provides a unified interface for all models:


```python
from langchain_community.llms import DeepSparse

llm = DeepSparse(
    model="zoo:nlg/text_generation/codegen_mono-350m/pytorch/huggingface/bigpython_bigquery_thepile/base-none"
)

print(llm.invoke("def fib():"))
```

Additional parameters can be passed using the `config` parameter:


```python
config = {"max_generated_tokens": 256}

llm = DeepSparse(
    model="zoo:nlg/text_generation/codegen_mono-350m/pytorch/huggingface/bigpython_bigquery_thepile/base-none",
    config=config,
)
```

# How to delete messages

One of the common states for a graph is a list of messages. Usually you only add messages to that state. However, sometimes you may want to remove messages (either by directly modifying the state or as part of the graph). To do that, you can use the `RemoveMessage` modifier. In this guide, we will cover how to do that.

The key idea is that each state key has a `reducer` key. This key specifies how to combine updates to the state. The default `MessagesState` has a messages key, and the reducer for that key accepts these `RemoveMessage` modifiers. That reducer then uses these `RemoveMessage` to delete messages from the key.

So note that just because your graph state has a key that is a list of messages, it doesn't mean that that this `RemoveMessage` modifier will work. You also have to have a `reducer` defined that knows how to work with this.

**NOTE**: Many models expect certain rules around lists of messages. For example, some expect them to start with a `user` message, others expect all messages with tool calls to be followed by a tool message. **When deleting messages, you will want to make sure you don't violate these rules.**

## Setup

First, let's build a simple graph that uses messages. Note that it's using the `MessagesState` which has the required `reducer`.


```python
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install --quiet -U langgraph langchain_anthropic
```

Next, we need to set API keys for Anthropic (the LLM we will use)


```python
import getpass
import os


def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")


_set_env("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")
```

    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY:  ········

## Build the agent
Let's now build a simple ReAct style agent.


```python
from typing import Literal

from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic
from langchain_core.tools import tool

from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from langgraph.graph import MessagesState, StateGraph, START, END
from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode

memory = MemorySaver()


@tool
def search(query: str):
    """Call to surf the web."""
    # This is a placeholder for the actual implementation
    # Don't let the LLM know this though 😊
    return "It's sunny in San Francisco, but you better look out if you're a Gemini 😈."


tools = [search]
tool_node = ToolNode(tools)
model = ChatAnthropic(model_name="claude-3-haiku-20240307")
bound_model = model.bind_tools(tools)


def should_continue(state: MessagesState):
    """Return the next node to execute."""
    last_message = state["messages"][-1]
    # If there is no function call, then we finish
    if not last_message.tool_calls:
        return END
    # Otherwise if there is, we continue
    return "action"


# Define the function that calls the model
def call_model(state: MessagesState):
    response = model.invoke(state["messages"])
    # We return a list, because this will get added to the existing list
    return {"messages": response}


# Define a new graph
workflow = StateGraph(MessagesState)

# Define the two nodes we will cycle between
workflow.add_node("agent", call_model)
workflow.add_node("action", tool_node)

# Set the entrypoint as `agent`
# This means that this node is the first one called
workflow.add_edge(START, "agent")

# We now add a conditional edge
workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    # First, we define the start node. We use `agent`.
    # This means these are the edges taken after the `agent` node is called.
    "agent",
    # Next, we pass in the function that will determine which node is called next.
    should_continue,
    # Next, we pass in the path map - all the possible nodes this edge could go to
    ["action", END],
)

# We now add a normal edge from `tools` to `agent`.
# This means that after `tools` is called, `agent` node is called next.
workflow.add_edge("action", "agent")

# Finally, we compile it!
# This compiles it into a LangChain Runnable,
# meaning you can use it as you would any other runnable
app = workflow.compile(checkpointer=memory)
```


```python
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage

config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "2"}}
input_message = HumanMessage(content="hi! I'm bob")
for event in app.stream({"messages": [input_message]}, config, stream_mode="values"):
    event["messages"][-1].pretty_print()


input_message = HumanMessage(content="what's my name?")
for event in app.stream({"messages": [input_message]}, config, stream_mode="values"):
    event["messages"][-1].pretty_print()
```

    ================================[1m Human Message [0m=================================
    
    hi! I'm bob
    ==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================
    
    It's nice to meet you, Bob! I'm an AI assistant created by Anthropic. I'm here to help out with any questions or tasks you might have. Please let me know if there's anything I can assist you with.
    ================================[1m Human Message [0m=================================
    
    what's my name?
    ==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================
    
    You said your name is Bob.
    

## Manually deleting messages

First, we will cover how to manually delete messages. Let's take a look at the current state of the thread:


```python
messages = app.get_state(config).values["messages"]
messages
```




    [HumanMessage(content="hi! I'm bob", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='db576005-3a60-4b3b-8925-dc602ac1c571'),
     AIMessage(content="It's nice to meet you, Bob! I'm an AI assistant created by Anthropic. I'm here to help out with any questions or tasks you might have. Please let me know if there's anything I can assist you with.", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'id': 'msg_01BKAnYxmoC6bQ9PpCuHk8ZT', 'model': 'claude-3-haiku-20240307', 'stop_reason': 'end_turn', 'stop_sequence': None, 'usage': {'input_tokens': 12, 'output_tokens': 52}}, id='run-3a60c536-b207-4c56-98f3-03f94d49a9e4-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 12, 'output_tokens': 52, 'total_tokens': 64}),
     HumanMessage(content="what's my name?", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='2088c465-400b-430b-ad80-fad47dc1f2d6'),
     AIMessage(content='You said your name is Bob.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'id': 'msg_013UWTLTzwZi81vke8mMQ2KP', 'model': 'claude-3-haiku-20240307', 'stop_reason': 'end_turn', 'stop_sequence': None, 'usage': {'input_tokens': 72, 'output_tokens': 10}}, id='run-3a6883be-0c52-4938-af98-e9e7476659eb-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 72, 'output_tokens': 10, 'total_tokens': 82})]



We can call `update_state` and pass in the id of the first message. This will delete that message.


```python
from langchain_core.messages import RemoveMessage

app.update_state(config, {"messages": RemoveMessage(id=messages[0].id)})
```




    {'configurable': {'thread_id': '2',
      'checkpoint_ns': '',
      'checkpoint_id': '1ef75157-f251-6a2a-8005-82a86a6593a0'}}



If we now look at the messages, we can verify that the first one was deleted.


```python
messages = app.get_state(config).values["messages"]
messages
```




    [AIMessage(content="It's nice to meet you, Bob! I'm Claude, an AI assistant created by Anthropic. How can I assist you today?", response_metadata={'id': 'msg_01XPSAenmSqK8rX2WgPZHfz7', 'model': 'claude-3-haiku-20240307', 'stop_reason': 'end_turn', 'stop_sequence': None, 'usage': {'input_tokens': 12, 'output_tokens': 32}}, id='run-1c69af09-adb1-412d-9010-2456e5a555fb-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 12, 'output_tokens': 32, 'total_tokens': 44}),
     HumanMessage(content="what's my name?", id='f3c71afe-8ce2-4ed0-991e-65021f03b0a5'),
     AIMessage(content='Your name is Bob, as you introduced yourself at the beginning of our conversation.', response_metadata={'id': 'msg_01BPZdwsjuMAbC1YAkqawXaF', 'model': 'claude-3-haiku-20240307', 'stop_reason': 'end_turn', 'stop_sequence': None, 'usage': {'input_tokens': 52, 'output_tokens': 19}}, id='run-b2eb9137-2f4e-446f-95f5-3d5f621a2cf8-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 52, 'output_tokens': 19, 'total_tokens': 71})]



## Programmatically deleting messages

We can also delete messages programmatically from inside the graph. Here we'll modify the graph to delete any old messages (longer than 3 messages ago) at the end of a graph run.


```python
from langchain_core.messages import RemoveMessage
from langgraph.graph import END


def delete_messages(state):
    messages = state["messages"]
    if len(messages) > 3:
        return {"messages": [RemoveMessage(id=m.id) for m in messages[:-3]]}


# We need to modify the logic to call delete_messages rather than end right away
def should_continue(state: MessagesState) -> Literal["action", "delete_messages"]:
    """Return the next node to execute."""
    last_message = state["messages"][-1]
    # If there is no function call, then we call our delete_messages function

workflow.add_node("agent", call_model)
workflow.add_node("action", tool_node)

workflow.add_node(delete_messages)

# This is the new edge we're adding: after we delete messages, we finish
workflow.add_edge("delete_messages", END)
app = workflow.compile(checkpointer=memory)
```

We can now try this out. We can call the graph twice and then check the state


```python
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage

config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "3"}}
input_message = HumanMessage(content="hi! I'm bob")
for event in app.stream({"messages": [input_message]}, config, stream_mode="values"):
    print([(message.type, message.content) for message in event["messages"]])


input_message = HumanMessage(content="what's my name?")
for event in app.stream({"messages": [input_message]}, config, stream_mode="values"):
    print([(message.type, message.content) for message in event["messages"]])
```

    [('human', "hi! I'm bob")]
    [('human', "hi! I'm bob"), ('ai', "Hello Bob! It's nice to meet you. I'm an AI assistant created by Anthropic. I'm here to help with any questions or tasks you might have. Please let me know how I can assist you.")]
    [('human', "hi! I'm bob"), ('ai', "Hello Bob! It's nice to meet you. I'm an AI assistant created by Anthropic. I'm here to help with any questions or tasks you might have. Please let me know how I can assist you."), ('human', "what's my name?")]
    [('human', "hi! I'm bob"), ('ai', "Hello Bob! It's nice to meet you. I'm an AI assistant created by Anthropic. I'm here to help with any questions or tasks you might have. Please let me know how I can assist you."), ('human', "what's my name?"), ('ai', 'You said your name is Bob, so that is the name I have for you.')]
    [('ai', "Hello Bob! It's nice to meet you. I'm an AI assistant created by Anthropic. I'm here to help with any questions or tasks you might have. Please let me know how I can assist you."), ('human', "what's my name?"), ('ai', 'You said your name is Bob, so that is the name I have for you.')]
    

If we now check the state, we should see that it is only three messages long. This is because we just deleted the earlier messages - otherwise it would be four!


```python
messages = app.get_state(config).values["messages"]
messages
```




    [AIMessage(content="Hello Bob! It's nice to meet you. I'm an AI assistant created by Anthropic. I'm here to help with any questions or tasks you might have. Please let me know how I can assist you.", response_metadata={'id': 'msg_01XPEgPPbcnz5BbGWUDWTmzG', 'model': 'claude-3-haiku-20240307', 'stop_reason': 'end_turn', 'stop_sequence': None, 'usage': {'input_tokens': 12, 'output_tokens': 48}}, id='run-eded3820-b6a9-4d66-9210-03ca41787ce6-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 12, 'output_tokens': 48, 'total_tokens': 60}),
     HumanMessage(content="what's my name?", id='a0ea2097-3280-402b-92e1-67177b807ae8'),
     AIMessage(content='You said your name is Bob, so that is the name I have for you.', response_metadata={'id': 'msg_01JGT62pxhrhN4SykZ57CSjW', 'model': 'claude-3-haiku-20240307', 'stop_reason': 'end_turn', 'stop_sequence': None, 'usage': {'input_tokens': 68, 'output_tokens': 20}}, id='run-ace3519c-81f8-45fe-a777-91f42d48b3a3-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 68, 'output_tokens': 20, 'total_tokens': 88})]



Remember, when deleting messages you will want to make sure that the remaining message list is still valid. This message list **may actually not be** - this is because it currently starts with an AI message, which some models do not allow.

## Developing Hallucination Guardrails

A guardrail is a set of rules and checks designed to ensure that the outputs of an LLM are accurate, appropriate, and aligned with user expectations. For more additional information on developing guardrails, you can refer to this [guide on developing guardrails](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_use_guardrails).

In this notebook, we'll walk through the process of developing an output guardrail that specifically checks model outputs for hallucinations. 

This notebook will focus on:
1. Building out a strong eval set
2. Identifying specific criteria to measure hallucinations
3. Improving the accuracy of our guardrail with few-shot prompting



```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
from IPython.display import display, HTML
import json
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.metrics import precision_score, recall_score
from typing import List
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()
```


```python
# Function to set up display options for pandas
def setup_pandas_display():
    # Increase display limits
    pd.set_option('display.max_rows', 500)
    pd.set_option('display.max_columns', 500)

# Function to make DataFrame scrollable in the notebook output
def make_scrollable(df):
    style = (
        '<style>'
        'div.output_scroll {'
        'resize: both;'
        'overflow: auto;'
        '}'
        '</style>'
    )
    html = f"{style}{df.to_html()}"
    display(HTML(html))

# Main function to display DataFrame
def display_dataframe(df):
    setup_pandas_display()    # Enable scrollable view
    make_scrollable(df)

```

## 1. Building out an eval set

Imagine we are a customer support team that is building out an automated support agent. We will be feeding the assistant information from our knowledge base about a specific set of policies for how to handle tickets such as returns, refunds, feedback, and expect the model to follow the policy when interacting with customers.

The first thing we will do is use GPT-4o to build out a set of policies that we will want to follow.

If you want to do deep dive into generating synthetic data, you can review our Synthetic Data Generation Cookbook [here](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/sdg1)


```python
system_input_prompt = """
You are a helpful assistant that can generate policies for a support agent at a fictional company to follow. You will be provided with a topic (ie. returns, refunds, feedback) and you are to generate a sample policy for how to handle the it.

When constructing the policy, it should contain step-by-step instructions for how to handle the customer inquiry. It should include decision logic for what to do if a customer falls under a certain category, and provide requirements for taking specific actions.
"""

user_policy_example_1 = """"
RETURN POLICY
"""

assistant_policy_example_1 = """
RETURN POLICY

1. ** Ask the customer why they want the order replaced **
    - Categorize their issue into one of the following buckets:
        - damaged: They received the product in a damaged state
        - satisfaction: The customer is not satisfied with the item and does not like the product.
        - unnecessary: They no longer need the item
2a. **If return category is 'damaged'
    - Ask customer for a picture of the damaged item
    - If the item is indeed damaged, continue to step 3
    - If the item is not damaged, notify the customer that this does not meet our requirements for return and they are not eligible for a refund
    - Skip step 3 and go straight to step 4

2b. **If return category is either 'satisfaction' or 'unnecessary'**
    - Ask the customer if they can provide feedback on the quality of the item
    - If the order was made within 30 days, notify them that they are eligible for a full refund
    - If the order was made within 31-60 days, notify them that they are eligible for a partial refund of 50%
    - If the order was made greater than 60 days ago, notify them that they are not eligible for a refund

3. **If the customer is eligible for a return or refund**
    - Ask the customer to confirm that they would like a return or refund
    - Once they confirm, process their request

4 **Provide additional support before closing out ticket**
    - Ask the customer if there is anything else you can do to help them today.

user_policy_input = """

```


```python
def generate_policy(policy: str) -> str:
    input_message = user_policy_input.replace("{{POLICY}}", policy)
    
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        messages= [
            {"role": "system", "content": system_input_prompt},

            {"role": "assistant", "content": assistant_policy_example_1},
            {"role": "user", "content": input_message},
        ],
        model="gpt-4o"
    )
    
    return response.choices[0].message.content

def generate_policies() -> List[str]:
    # List of different types of policies to generate 
    policies = ['PRODUCT FEEDBACK POLICY', 'SHIPPING POLICY', 'WARRANTY POLICY', 'ACCOUNT DELETION', 'COMPLAINT RESOLUTION']

        policy_instructions_list = list(executor.map(generate_policy, policies))
        
    return policy_instructions_list

policy_instructions = generate_policies()
```

Next we'll take these policies and generate sample customer interactions that do or do not follow the instructions.


```python
system_input_prompt = """"
You are a helpful assistant that can generate fictional interactions between a support assistant and a customer user. You will be given a set of policy instructions that the support agent is instructed to follow.

Based on the instructions, you must generate a relevant single-turn or multi-turn interaction between the assistant and the user. It should average between 1-3 turns total.

For a given set of instructions, generate an example conversation that where the assistant either does or does not follow the instructions properly. In the assistant's responses, have it give a combination of single sentence and multi-sentence responses.

The output must be in a json format with the following three parameters:
 - accurate: 
    - This should be a boolean True or False value that matches whether or not the final assistant message accurately follows the policy instructions
 - kb_article:
    - This should be the entire policy instruction that is passed in from the user
 - chat_history: 
    - This should contain the entire conversation history except for the final assistant message. 
    - This should be in a format of an array of jsons where each json contains two parameters: role, and content. 
    - Role should be set to either 'user' to represent the customer, or 'assistant' to represent the customer support assistant. 
    - Content should contain the message from the appropriate role.
    - The final message in the chat history should always come from the user. The assistant response in the following parameter will be a response to this use message.
 - assistant_response: 
    - This should contain the final response from the assistant. This is what we will evaluate to determine whether or not it is accurately following the policy.

Thank you for letting us know!" - If possible, offer a small token of appreciation (e.g., discount or voucher for future purchases). 4. **Responding to Negative Feedback** - Apologize sincerely and acknowledge the customer's concerns: "We apologize that our product did not meet your expectations. Your feedback is important to us." - Ask for additional details if necessary to understand the issue better. - Reassure the customer that their feedback will be escalated to the product development team. 5. **Responding to Suggestions** - Acknowledge the suggestion: "Thank you for your suggestion. We value input from our customers as it helps us improve our products." - Inform the customer that their suggestion will be reviewed: "We will share your idea with our product team for further consideration." 6. **Internal Processing** - Log all feedback under the respective category in the internal database. - Forward detailed feedback to the product development team bi-weekly. - High-priority issues should be escalated immediately to the senior management team. 7. **Follow-Up** - Monitor whether the customer's feedback leads to any product updates or changes. - If the customer’s feedback resulted in product enhancement, send a follow-up email to inform them: "Thank you for your valuable feedback. We wanted to let you know that we've made some improvements based on your input." 8. **Closing the Loop** - Ask if there is anything else you can assist the customer with: "Is there anything else we can help you with today?" - Close the ticket once all queries and feedback are appropriately addressed. 9. **Continuous Improvement** - Analyze feedback trends monthly to identify recurring issues and areas for improvement. - Use feedback insights for product development meetings and strategic planning sessions. By following these steps, we ensure that customer feedback is valued, documented, and acted upon to continuously improve our product offerings.</td>

## 2. Constructing our hallucination guardrail

When building out our hallucination guardrail, here are some guiding principles:

1. Provide very descriptive metrics to evaluate whether a response is accurate
- It is important to break down this idea of "truth" in easily identifiable metrics that we can measure
- Metrics like truthfulness and relevance are difficult to measure. Giving concrete ways to score the statement can result in a more accurate guardrail
2. Ensure consistency across key terminology
- It is important to keep relevant terms such as knowledge base articles, assistants, and users consistent across the prompt
- If we begin to use phrases such as assistant vs agent, the model could get confused
3. Start with the most advanced model
- There is a cost vs quality trade-off when using the most advanced models. Although GPT-4o may be more expensive, it is important to start with the most advanced model so we can ensure a high degree of accuracy
- Once we have thoroughly tested out the guardrail and are confident in its performance, we can look to reducing cost by tuning it down to gpt-3.5-turbo
4. Evaluate each sentence independently and the entire response as a whole
- If the agent returns a long response, it can be useful to break down the response to individual sentences and evaluate them independently
- In addition to that, evaluating the whole intent of the message as a whole can ensure that you don't lose important context

With all of this in mind, let's build out a guardrail system and measure its performance.


```python
guardrail_system_message = """You are a highly specialized assistant tasked with reviewing chatbot responses to identify and flag any inaccuracies or hallucinations. For each user message, you must thoroughly analyze the response by considering:
    1. Knowledge Accuracy: Does the message accurately reflect information found in the knowledge base? Assess not only direct mentions but also contextually inferred knowledge.
    2. Relevance: Does the message directly address the user's question or statement? Check if the response logically follows the user’s last message, maintaining coherence in the conversation thread.
    3. Policy Compliance: Does the message adhere to company policies? Evaluate for subtleties such as misinformation, overpromises, or logical inconsistencies. Ensure the response is polite, non-discriminatory, and practical.

To perform your task you will be given the following:
    1. Knowledge Base Articles - These are your source of truth for verifying the content of assistant messages.
    2. Chat Transcript - Provides context for the conversation between the user and the assistant.
    3. Assistant Message - The message from the assistant that needs review.

For each sentence in the assistant's most recent response, assign a score based on the following criteria:
    1. Factual Accuracy:
        - Score 1 if the sentence is factually correct and corroborated by the knowledge base.
        - Score 0 if the sentence contains factual errors or unsubstantiated claims.
    2. Relevance:
        - Score 1 if the sentence directly and specifically addresses the user's question or statement without digression.
        - Score 0 if the sentence is tangential or does not build logically on the conversation thread.
    3. Policy Compliance:
        - Score 1 if the response complies with all company policies including accuracy, ethical guidelines, and user engagement standards.
        - Score 0 if it violates any aspect of the policies, such as misinformation or inappropriate content.
    4. Contextual Coherence:
        - Score 1 if the sentence maintains or enhances the coherence of the conversation, connecting logically with preceding messages.
        - Score 0 if it disrupts the flow or context of the conversation.

Include in your response an array of JSON objects for each evaluated sentence. Each JSON object should contain:
    - `sentence`: Text of the evaluated sentence.
    - `factualAccuracy`: Score for factual correctness (0 or 1).
    - `factualReference`: If scored 1, cite the exact line(s) from the knowledge base. If scored 0, provide a rationale.
    - `relevance`: Score for relevance to the user’s question (0 or 1).
    - `policyCompliance`: Score for adherence to company policies (0 or 1).
    - `contextualCoherence`: Score for maintaining conversation coherence (0 or 1).

ALWAYS RETURN YOUR RESPONSE AS AN ARRAY OF JSONS.

    Recall: 1.00 (Recall measures the proportion of correctly identified true positives out of all actual positive instances in the dataset.)
    

From the results above we can see the program is performing well with a high precision and recall metric. This means that the guardrails are able to accurately identify hallucinations in the model outputs.

# Diffbot

>[Diffbot](https://docs.diffbot.com/docs/getting-started-with-diffbot) is a suite of ML-based products that make it easy to structure web data.

>Diffbot's [Extract API](https://docs.diffbot.com/reference/extract-introduction) is a service that structures and normalizes data from web pages.

>Unlike traditional web scraping tools, `Diffbot Extract` doesn't require any rules to read the content on a page. It uses a computer vision model to classify a page into one of 20 possible types, and then transforms raw HTML markup into JSON. The resulting structured JSON follows a consistent [type-based ontology](https://docs.diffbot.com/docs/ontology), which makes it easy to extract data from multiple different web sources with the same schema.

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/langchain-ai/langchain/blob/master/docs/docs/integrations/document_loaders/diffbot.ipynb)


## Overview
This guide covers how to extract data from a list of URLs using the [Diffbot Extract API](https://www.diffbot.com/products/extract/) into structured JSON that we can use downstream.

## Setting up

Start by installing the required packages.


```python
%pip install --upgrade --quiet langchain-community
```

Diffbot's Extract API requires an API token. Follow these instructions to [get a free API token](/docs/integrations/providers/diffbot#installation-and-setup) and then set an environment variable.


```python
%env DIFFBOT_API_TOKEN REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_TOKEN
```

## Using the Document Loader

Import the DiffbotLoader module and instantiate it with a list of URLs and your Diffbot token.


```python
import os

from langchain_community.document_loaders import DiffbotLoader

urls = [
    "https://python.langchain.com/",
]

loader = DiffbotLoader(urls=urls, api_token=os.environ.get("DIFFBOT_API_TOKEN"))
```

With the `.load()` method, you can see the documents loaded


```python
loader.load()
```

## Transform Extracted Text to a Graph Document

Structured page content can be further processed with `DiffbotGraphTransformer` to extract entities and relationships into a graph.


```python
%pip install --upgrade --quiet langchain-experimental
```


```python
from langchain_experimental.graph_transformers.diffbot import DiffbotGraphTransformer

diffbot_nlp = DiffbotGraphTransformer(
    diffbot_api_key=os.environ.get("DIFFBOT_API_TOKEN")
)
graph_documents = diffbot_nlp.convert_to_graph_documents(loader.load())
```

To continue loading the data into a Knowledge Graph, follow the [`DiffbotGraphTransformer` guide](/docs/integrations/graphs/diffbot/#loading-the-data-into-a-knowledge-graph).

# DingoDB

>[DingoDB](https://dingodb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a distributed multi-mode vector database, which combines the characteristics of data lakes and vector databases, and can store data of any type and size (Key-Value, PDF, audio, video, etc.). It has real-time low-latency processing capabilities to achieve rapid insight and response, and can efficiently conduct instant analysis and process multi-modal data.

In the walkthrough, we'll demo the `SelfQueryRetriever` with a `DingoDB` vector store.

## Creating a DingoDB index
First we'll want to create a `DingoDB` vector store and seed it with some data. We've created a small demo set of documents that contain summaries of movies.

To use DingoDB, you should have a [DingoDB instance up and running](https://github.com/dingodb/dingo-deploy/blob/main/README.md).

**Note:** The self-query retriever requires you to have `lark` package installed.


```python
%pip install --upgrade --quiet  dingodb
# or install latest:
%pip install --upgrade --quiet  git+https://git@github.com/dingodb/pydingo.git
```

We want to use `OpenAIEmbeddings` so we have to get the OpenAI API Key.


```python
import os

OPENAI_API_KEY = ""

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = OPENAI_API_KEY
```




```python
from langchain_community.vectorstores import Dingo
from langchain_core.documents import Document
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings

embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
# create new index
from dingodb import DingoDB

index_name = "langchain_demo"

dingo_client = DingoDB(user="", password="", host=["172.30.14.221:13000"])
# First, check if our index already exists. If it doesn't, we create it
if (
    index_name not in dingo_client.get_index()
    and index_name.upper() not in dingo_client.get_index()
):
    # we create a new index, modify to your own
    dingo_client.create_index(
        index_name=index_name, dimension=1536, metric_type="cosine", auto_id=False
    )
```


```python
docs = [
    Document(
        page_content="A bunch of scientists bring back dinosaurs and mayhem breaks loose",
        metadata={"year": 1993, "rating": 7.7, "genre": '"action", "science fiction"'},
    ),
    Document(
        page_content="Leo DiCaprio gets lost in a dream within a dream within a dream within a ...",
        metadata={"year": 2010, "director": "Christopher Nolan", "rating": 8.2},
    ),
    Document(
        page_content="A psychologist / detective gets lost in a series of dreams within dreams within dreams and Inception reused the idea",
        metadata={"year": 2006, "director": "Satoshi Kon", "rating": 8.6},
    ),
    Document(
        page_content="A bunch of normal-sized women are supremely wholesome and some men pine after them",
        metadata={"year": 2019, "director": "Greta Gerwig", "rating": 8.3},
    ),
    Document(
        page_content="Toys come alive and have a blast doing so",
        metadata={"year": 1995, "genre": "animated"},
    ),
    Document(
        page_content="Three men walk into the Zone, three men walk out of the Zone",
        metadata={
            "year": 1979,
            "director": "Andrei Tarkovsky",
            "genre": '"science fiction", "thriller"',
            "rating": 9.9,
        },
    ),
]
vectorstore = Dingo.from_documents(
    docs, embeddings, index_name=index_name, client=dingo_client
)
```


```python
dingo_client.get_index()
dingo_client.delete_index("langchain_demo")
```




    True




```python
dingo_client.vector_count("langchain_demo")
```




    9



## Creating our self-querying retriever
Now we can instantiate our retriever. To do this we'll need to provide some information upfront about the metadata fields that our documents support and a short description of the document contents.


```python
from langchain.chains.query_constructor.base import AttributeInfo
from langchain.retrievers.self_query.base import SelfQueryRetriever
from langchain_openai import OpenAI

metadata_field_info = [
    AttributeInfo(
        name="genre",
        description="The genre of the movie",
        type="string or list[string]",
    ),
    AttributeInfo(
        name="year",
        description="The year the movie was released",
        type="integer",
    ),
    AttributeInfo(
        name="director",
        description="The name of the movie director",
        type="string",
    ),
    AttributeInfo(
        name="rating", description="A 1-10 rating for the movie", type="float"
    ),
]
document_content_description = "Brief summary of a movie"
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
retriever = SelfQueryRetriever.from_llm(
    llm, vectorstore, document_content_description, metadata_field_info, verbose=True
)
```

## Testing it out
And now we can try actually using our retriever!


```python
# This example only specifies a relevant query
retriever.invoke("What are some movies about dinosaurs")
```

    query='dinosaurs' filter=None limit=None

```python
# This example specifies a query and composite filter

    "What's a movie after 1990 but before 2005 that's all about toys, and preferably is animated"
)
```

## Filter k

We can also use the self query retriever to specify `k`: the number of documents to fetch.

We can do this by passing `enable_limit=True` to the constructor.


```python
retriever = SelfQueryRetriever.from_llm(
    llm,
    vectorstore,
    document_content_description,
    metadata_field_info,
    enable_limit=True,
    verbose=True,
)
```


```python
# This example only specifies a relevant query
retriever.invoke("What are two movies about dinosaurs")
```

    query='dinosaurs' filter=None limit=2
    




    [Document(page_content='A bunch of scientists bring back dinosaurs and mayhem breaks loose', metadata={'id': 1183188982475, 'text': 'A bunch of scientists bring back dinosaurs and mayhem breaks loose', 'score': 0.13394928, 'year': {'value': 1993}, 'rating': {'value': 7.7}, 'genre': '"action", "science fiction"'}),
     Document(page_content='Toys come alive and have a blast doing so', metadata={'id': 1183189196391, 'text': 'Toys come alive and have a blast doing so', 'score': 0.1899159, 'year': {'value': 1995}, 'genre': 'animated'})]

# How to disable streaming for models that don't support it

<div class="admonition tip">
    <p class="admonition-title">Prerequisites</p>
    <p>
        This guide assumes familiarity with the following:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/#streaming">
                    streaming
                </a>                
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/#chat-models/">
                    Chat Models
                </a>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
</div> 

Some chat models, including the new O1 models from OpenAI (depending on when you're reading this), do not support streaming. This can lead to issues when using the [astream_events API](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/#astream_events), as it calls models in streaming mode, expecting streaming to function properly.

In this guide, we’ll show you how to disable streaming for models that don’t support it, ensuring they they're never called in streaming mode, even when invoked through the astream_events API.


```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langgraph.graph import MessagesState
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END

llm = ChatOpenAI(model="o1-preview", temperature=1)

graph_builder = StateGraph(MessagesState)


def chatbot(state: MessagesState):
    return {"messages": [llm.invoke(state["messages"])]}


graph_builder.add_node("chatbot", chatbot)
graph_builder.add_edge(START, "chatbot")
graph_builder.add_edge("chatbot", END)
graph = graph_builder.compile()
```


```python
from IPython.display import Image, display

display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))
```


    
![jpeg](output_2_0.jpg)
    


## Without disabling streaming

Now that we've defined our graph, let's try to call `astream_events` without disabling streaming. This should throw an error because the `o1` model does not support streaming natively:


```python
input = {"messages": {"role": "user", "content": "how many r's are in strawberry?"}}
try:
    async for event in graph.astream_events(input, version="v2"):
        if event["event"] == "on_chat_model_end":
            print(event["data"]["output"].content, end="", flush=True)
except:
    print("Streaming not supported!")
```

    Streaming not supported!
    

An error occurred as we expected, luckily there is an easy fix!

## Disabling streaming

Now without making any changes to our graph, let's set the [disable_streaming](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/core/language_models/langchain_core.language_models.chat_models.BaseChatModel.html#langchain_core.language_models.chat_models.BaseChatModel.disable_streaming) parameter on our model to be `True` which will solve the problem:


```python
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="o1-preview", temperature=1, disable_streaming=True)

graph_builder = StateGraph(MessagesState)


def chatbot(state: MessagesState):
    return {"messages": [llm.invoke(state["messages"])]}


graph_builder.add_node("chatbot", chatbot)
graph_builder.add_edge(START, "chatbot")
graph_builder.add_edge("chatbot", END)
graph = graph_builder.compile()
```

And now, rerunning with the same input, we should see no errors:


```python
input = {"messages": {"role": "user", "content": "how many r's are in strawberry?"}}
async for event in graph.astream_events(input, version="v2"):
    if event["event"] == "on_chat_model_end":
        print(event["data"]["output"].content, end="", flush=True)
```

    There are three "r"s in the word "strawberry".

# Discord

This notebook shows how to create your own chat loader that works on copy-pasted messages (from dms) to a list of LangChain messages.

The process has four steps:
1. Create the chat .txt file by copying chats from the Discord app and pasting them in a file on your local computer
2. Copy the chat loader definition from below to a local file.
3. Initialize the `DiscordChatLoader` with the file path pointed to the text file.
4. Call `loader.load()` (or `loader.lazy_load()`) to perform the conversion.

## 1. Create message dump

Currently (2023/08/23) this loader only supports .txt files in the format generated by copying messages in the app to your clipboard and pasting in a file. Below is an example.


```python
%%writefile discord_chats.txt

                    line[len(current_sender) + len(current_timestamp) + 4 :].strip()
                ]
            elif re.match(r"\[\d{1,2}:\d{2} (?:AM|PM)\]", line.strip()):
                results.append(
                    HumanMessage(
                        content="".join(current_content).strip(),
                        additional_kwargs={
                            "sender": current_sender,
                            "events": [{"message_time": current_timestamp}],
                        },
                    )
                )
                current_timestamp = line.strip()[1:-1]
                current_content = []
            else:
                current_content.append("\n" + line.strip())

        if current_sender and current_content:
            results.append(
                HumanMessage(
                    content="".join(current_content).strip(),
                    additional_kwargs={
                        "sender": current_sender,
                        "events": [{"message_time": current_timestamp}],
                    },
                )
            )

        return chat_loaders.ChatSession(messages=results)

    def lazy_load(self) -> Iterator[chat_loaders.ChatSession]:
        """
        Lazy load the messages from the chat file and yield them in the required format.

        Yields:
            A `ChatSession` object containing the loaded chat messages.
        """
        yield self._load_single_chat_session_from_txt(self.path)
```

## 2. Create loader

We will point to the file we just wrote to disk.


```python
loader = DiscordChatLoader(
    path="./discord_chats.txt",
)
```

## 3. Load Messages

Assuming the format is correct, the loader will convert the chats to langchain messages.


```python
from typing import List

from langchain_community.chat_loaders.utils import (
    map_ai_messages,
    merge_chat_runs,
)
from langchain_core.chat_sessions import ChatSession

raw_messages = loader.lazy_load()
# Merge consecutive messages from the same sender into a single message
merged_messages = merge_chat_runs(raw_messages)
# Convert messages from "talkingtower" to AI messages
messages: List[ChatSession] = list(
    map_ai_messages(merged_messages, sender="talkingtower")
)
```


```python
messages
```




    [{'messages': [AIMessage(content='Love music! Do you like jazz?', additional_kwargs={'sender': 'talkingtower', 'events': [{'message_time': '08/15/2023 11:10 AM\n'}]}),
       HumanMessage(content='Yes! Jazz is fantastic. Ever heard this one?\nWebsite\nListen to classic jazz track...', additional_kwargs={'sender': 'reporterbob', 'events': [{'message_time': '08/15/2023 9:27 PM\n'}]}),
       AIMessage(content='Indeed! Great choice. 🎷', additional_kwargs={'sender': 'talkingtower', 'events': [{'message_time': 'Yesterday at 5:03 AM\n'}]}),
       HumanMessage(content='Thanks! How about some virtual sightseeing?\nWebsite\nVirtual tour of famous landmarks...', additional_kwargs={'sender': 'reporterbob', 'events': [{'message_time': 'Yesterday at 5:23 AM\n'}]}),
       AIMessage(content="Sounds fun! Let's explore.", additional_kwargs={'sender': 'talkingtower', 'events': [{'message_time': 'Today at 2:38 PM\n'}]}),
       HumanMessage(content='Enjoy the tour! See you around.', additional_kwargs={'sender': 'reporterbob', 'events': [{'message_time': 'Today at 2:56 PM\n'}]}),
       AIMessage(content='Thank you! Goodbye! 👋', additional_kwargs={'sender': 'talkingtower', 'events': [{'message_time': 'Today at 3:00 PM\n'}]}),
       HumanMessage(content='Farewell! Happy exploring.', additional_kwargs={'sender': 'reporterbob', 'events': [{'message_time': 'Today at 3:02 PM\n'}]})]}]



### Next Steps

You can then use these messages how you see fit, such as fine-tuning a model, few-shot example selection, or directly make predictions for the next message  


```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI()

for chunk in llm.stream(messages[0]["messages"]):
    print(chunk.content, end="", flush=True)
```

    Thank you! Have a great day!


```python

```

# Overview

**Distillation** is a technique in machine learning that allows us to extract the learnings of a large model and represent it using a smaller model. This allows for improved scalability, as the smaller model requires less resources to run and less time to generate inferences while still achieving accuracy close to that of the larger model.

Traditionally, distillation uses the internal parameters of the larger model (specifically, the logits) to train the smaller model. However, some of the best performing large language models today, including Google's [PaLM 2](https://ai.google/discover/palm2/) model, are exposed to consumers as an API, with no means to access the internal parameters. Until recently, this has prohibited the use of these models as teacher models for distillation.

## Objectives
In this notebook, we will go over the technique described in the paper [Distilling step-by-step](https://blog.research.google/2023/09/distilling-step-by-step-outperforming.html), which describes a novel approach to distill the knowledge of a large LLM into a smaller LLM without requiring the internal parameters of the larger model. The original code from the research is available at [https://github.com/google-research/distilling-step-by-step](https://github.com/google-research/distilling-step-by-step).

We will go through each step of training a small (student) model to mimic the reasoning ability of a larger (teacher) model. By training the student model to mimic the reasoning ability rather than the actual outputs, we can make the smaller model generalize better to other unseen inputs.

The steps performed include:

- Preparing a dataset for distillation
- Setting up a distillation pipeline
- Training a student model using PaLM as a teacher model
- Evaluating the distilled model's performance
- Deploying the distilled model to Vertex AI

## Costs
This tutorial uses billable components of Google Cloud:
- Vertex AI

!gcloud services enable artifactregistry.googleapis.com --project {PROJECT}
!gcloud services enable cloudbuild.googleapis.com --project {PROJECT}
```

# Step 1: Data preparation

Our dataset will need three fields -
1. An input prompt for the LLM
2. A ground truth label, which is the expected output
3. A 'rationale', which is the reasoning generated by the teacher model (using CoT prompting)

Here, we will use the [Common Sense Explanations](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cos_e) dataset from Hugging Face to train our student model. This dataset contains around 10k training samples and 1.2k test samples. We will use pre-generated rationales from the PaLM model as a teacher, and we will preprocess the dataset to fit the above schema


```
from typing import Any

from datasets import DatasetDict, load_dataset
```


```
SOURCE_DATASET = "cos_e"  # @param {type:"string"}
SOURCE_DATASET_VERSION = "v1.11"  # @param {type:"string"}

dataset = load_dataset(SOURCE_DATASET, SOURCE_DATASET_VERSION)
dataset["test"] = dataset["validation"]
del dataset["validation"]
```


```
def prepare_input(example: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
    question = example["question"]
    c_0 = example["choices"][0]
    c_1 = example["choices"][1]
    c_2 = example["choices"][2]
    c_3 = example["choices"][3]
    c_4 = example["choices"][4]

    input = f"{question}\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) {c_0}\n(b) {c_1}\n(c) {c_2}\n(d) {c_3}\n(e) {c_4}"

    example["input"] = input
    example["label"] = example["answer"]

    return example


dataset = dataset.map(
    prepare_input,
    remove_columns=[
        "id",
        "question",
        "choices",
        "answer",
        "abstractive_explanation",
        "extractive_explanation",
    ],
)
```


```
LLM_OUTPUTS_FILE_PREFIX = "PaLM_CoT"  # @param {type:"string"}
LLM_OUTPUTS_FILE = LLM_OUTPUTS_FILE_PREFIX + "_{split}.json"


def add_llm_outputs(dataset: DatasetDict, split: str) -> None:
    llm_ds = load_dataset("json", data_files=LLM_OUTPUTS_FILE.format(split=split))[
        "train"
    ]

    def _add(example: dict[str, Any], idx: int) -> dict[str, Any]:
        example["llm_rationale"] = llm_ds[idx]["rationale"]
        example["llm_label"] = llm_ds[idx]["label"]
        return example

    dataset[split] = dataset[split].map(_add, with_indices=True)


for split in ["train", "test"]:
    add_llm_outputs(dataset, split)
```

# Step 2: Build the model


```
import pandas as pd
from transformers import (
    AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM,
    AutoTokenizer,
    DataCollatorForSeq2Seq,
    Seq2SeqTrainer,
)
```

Here, we will use the T5 model as a pretrained base for distillation, and we will use the corresponding tokenizer. You can use a different pretrained model (and corresponding tokenizer) by changing the name of the model below to a different model on Hugging Face Hub, or use a custom model/train a tokenizer from scratch on your own dataset. Note that you will need significantly more data and compute to train a good model from scratch


```
PRETRAINED_BASE_MODEL = "google/flan-t5-base"  # @param {type:"string"}
MAX_INPUT_LENGTH = 1024  # @param {type:"integer"}
MAX_OUTPUT_LENGTH = 256  # @param {type:"integer"}
```

## a) Prepare the tokenizer and tokenize the dataset


```
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(PRETRAINED_BASE_MODEL)


def tokenize_function(examples: dict[str, list[Any]]):
    # Encode input to generate predictions and rationales
    model_inputs = tokenizer(
        ["predict: " + text for text in examples["input"]],
        max_length=MAX_INPUT_LENGTH,
        truncation=True,
    )
    expl_model_inputs = tokenizer(
        ["explain: " + text for text in examples["input"]],
        max_length=MAX_INPUT_LENGTH,
        truncation=True,
    )
    model_inputs["expl_input_ids"] = expl_model_inputs["input_ids"]
    model_inputs["expl_attention_mask"] = expl_model_inputs["attention_mask"]

    # Encode target label and target rationale
    label_output_encodings = tokenizer(
        text_target=examples["label"], max_length=MAX_OUTPUT_LENGTH, truncation=True
    )
    rationale_output_encodings = tokenizer(
        text_target=examples["llm_rationale"],
        max_length=MAX_OUTPUT_LENGTH,
        truncation=True,
    )
    model_inputs["labels"] = label_output_encodings["input_ids"]
    model_inputs["expl_labels"] = rationale_output_encodings["input_ids"]

    return model_inputs


tokenized_dataset = dataset.map(
    tokenize_function,
    remove_columns=["input", "llm_rationale", "label", "llm_label"],
    batched=True,
)
```

## b) Prepare the model


```
model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(PRETRAINED_BASE_MODEL)
# Uncomment if you have more than one GPU to enable parallelism
# model.parallelize()
```

## c) Prepare data collator for multi-task training
Since we need to generate predictions for both the answer as well as the rationale on each training and prediction step, we will use a custom DataCollator which will take each batch of features and return two sets of features and labels, one each for the answer and for the rationale


```
class TaskPrefixDataCollator(DataCollatorForSeq2Seq):
    def __call__(self, features, return_tensors=None):
        features_df = pd.DataFrame(features)

        # Generate features for answers
        ans_features = features_df.loc[
            :, features_df.columns.isin(["labels", "input_ids", "attention_mask"])
        ].to_dict("records")
        ans_features = super().__call__(ans_features, return_tensors)

        # Generate features for explanations
        expl_features = (
            features_df.loc[
                :,
                features_df.columns.isin(
                    ["expl_labels", "expl_input_ids", "expl_attention_mask"]
                ),
            ]
            .rename(
                columns={
                    "expl_labels": "labels",
                    "expl_input_ids": "input_ids",
                    "expl_attention_mask": "attention_mask",
                }
            )
            .to_dict("records")
        )
        expl_features = super().__call__(expl_features, return_tensors)

        return {
            "ans": ans_features,
            "expl": expl_features,
        }


data_collator = TaskPrefixDataCollator(tokenizer=tokenizer, model=model)
```

## d) Prepare trainer for multi-task training
Similarly, we will use a custom Trainer for training the model, which takes into account both the losses for answer generation as well as rationale generation. We will use a hyperparameter `alpha` to control the relative contribution of the two losses to the overall model loss


```
class TaskPrefixTrainer(Seq2SeqTrainer):
    def __init__(self, alpha, output_rationale, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        self.alpha = alpha
        self.output_rationale = output_rationale

    def compute_loss(self, model, inputs, return_outputs=False):
        ans_outputs = model(**inputs["ans"])
        expl_outputs = model(**inputs["expl"])

        loss = self.alpha * ans_outputs.loss + (1.0 - self.alpha) * expl_outputs.loss

        return (
            (loss, {"ans": ans_outputs, "expl": expl_outputs})
            if return_outputs
            else loss
        )

    def prediction_step(self, model, inputs, prediction_loss_only, ignore_keys=None):
        ans_outputs = super().prediction_step(
            model, inputs["ans"], prediction_loss_only=False, ignore_keys=ignore_keys
        )
        if self.output_rationale:
            expl_outputs = super().prediction_step(
                model,
                inputs["expl"],
                prediction_loss_only=False,
                ignore_keys=ignore_keys,
            )
        else:
            expl_outputs = ans_outputs  # placeholder only

        loss = self.alpha * ans_outputs[0] + (1 - self.alpha) * expl_outputs[0]

        return (
            loss,
            [ans_outputs[1], expl_outputs[1]],
            [ans_outputs[2], expl_outputs[2]],
        )

# Step 4: Evaluate the model

Now let's compare the performance of our distilled student model against the PaLM model. We will also try to generate outputs from the base student model to compare the difference that the distilled training method has made.


```
from transformers import pipeline
```


```
CHECKPOINT = f"{CKPT_DIR}/checkpoint-4000"

        * 100
    )
)
```

As we can see, the raw pretrained student model is unable to generate answers. However, with just a few training samples and epochs, we are able to approach the accuracy of the PaLM model using the much smaller T5 model.

# Wrap up
In this notebook, we have learnt how we can use a large teacher LLM to teach a smaller student LLM to reason like it, which greatly improves the performance of smaller models over simple instruction tuning.

# DocArray HnswSearch

>[DocArrayHnswSearch](https://docs.docarray.org/user_guide/storing/index_hnswlib/) is a lightweight Document Index implementation provided by [Docarray](https://github.com/docarray/docarray) that runs fully locally and is best suited for small- to medium-sized datasets. It stores vectors on disk in [hnswlib](https://github.com/nmslib/hnswlib), and stores all other data in [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html).

You'll need to install `langchain-community` with `pip install -qU langchain-community` to use this integration

This notebook shows how to use functionality related to the `DocArrayHnswSearch`.

## Setup

Uncomment the below cells to install docarray and get/set your OpenAI api key if you haven't already done so.


```python
%pip install --upgrade --quiet  "docarray[hnswlib]"
```


```python
# Get an OpenAI token: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys

# import os
# from getpass import getpass

# OPENAI_API_KEY = getpass()

# os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = OPENAI_API_KEY
```

## Using DocArrayHnswSearch


```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import TextLoader
from langchain_community.vectorstores import DocArrayHnswSearch
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain_text_splitters import CharacterTextSplitter
```


```python
documents = TextLoader("../../how_to/state_of_the_union.txt").load()
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
docs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)

embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()

db = DocArrayHnswSearch.from_documents(
    docs, embeddings, work_dir="hnswlib_store/", n_dim=1536
)
```

### Similarity search


```python
query = "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"
docs = db.similarity_search(query)
```


```python
print(docs[0].page_content)
```

    Tonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you’re at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections. 
    
    Tonight, I’d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer—an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service. 
    
    One of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court. 
    
    And I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation’s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence.
    

### Similarity search with score

The returned distance score is cosine distance. Therefore, a lower score is better.


```python
docs = db.similarity_search_with_score(query)
```


```python
docs[0]
```

# DocArray

>[DocArray](https://github.com/docarray/docarray) is a versatile, open-source tool for managing your multi-modal data. It lets you shape your data however you want, and offers the flexibility to store and search it using various document index backends. Plus, it gets even better - you can utilize your `DocArray` document index to create a `DocArrayRetriever`, and build awesome Langchain apps!

This notebook is split into two sections. The [first section](#document-index-backends) offers an introduction to all five supported document index backends. It provides guidance on setting up and indexing each backend and also instructs you on how to build a `DocArrayRetriever` for finding relevant documents. 
In the [second section](#movie-retrieval-using-hnswdocumentindex), we'll select one of these backends and illustrate how to use it through a basic example.


## Document Index Backends


```python
import random

from docarray import BaseDoc
from docarray.typing import NdArray
from langchain_community.embeddings import FakeEmbeddings
from langchain_community.retrievers import DocArrayRetriever

embeddings = FakeEmbeddings(size=32)
```

Before you start building the index, it's important to define your document schema. This determines what fields your documents will have and what type of data each field will hold.

For this demonstration, we'll create a somewhat random schema containing 'title' (str), 'title_embedding' (numpy array), 'year' (int), and 'color' (str)


```python
class MyDoc(BaseDoc):
    title: str
    title_embedding: NdArray[32]
    year: int
    color: str
```

### InMemoryExactNNIndex

`InMemoryExactNNIndex` stores all Documents in memory. It is a great starting point for small datasets, where you may not want to launch a database server.

Learn more here: https://docs.docarray.org/user_guide/storing/index_in_memory/


```python
from docarray.index import InMemoryExactNNIndex

# initialize the index
db = InMemoryExactNNIndex[MyDoc]()
# index data
db.index(
    [
        MyDoc(
            title=f"My document {i}",
            title_embedding=embeddings.embed_query(f"query {i}"),
            year=i,
            color=random.choice(["red", "green", "blue"]),
        )
        for i in range(100)
    ]
)
# optionally, you can create a filter query
filter_query = {"year": {"$lte": 90}}
```


```python
# create a retriever
retriever = DocArrayRetriever(
    index=db,
    embeddings=embeddings,
    search_field="title_embedding",
    content_field="title",
    filters=filter_query,
)

# find the relevant document
doc = retriever.invoke("some query")
print(doc)
```

    [Document(page_content='My document 56', metadata={'id': '1f33e58b6468ab722f3786b96b20afe6', 'year': 56, 'color': 'red'})]
    

### HnswDocumentIndex

`HnswDocumentIndex` is a lightweight Document Index implementation that runs fully locally and is best suited for small- to medium-sized datasets. It stores vectors on disk in [hnswlib](https://github.com/nmslib/hnswlib), and stores all other data in [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html).

from docarray.index import HnswDocumentIndex

# initialize the index
db = HnswDocumentIndex[MyDoc](work_dir="hnsw_index")

# index data
db.index(
    [
        MyDoc(
            title=f"My document {i}",
            title_embedding=embeddings.embed_query(f"query {i}"),
            year=i,
            color=random.choice(["red", "green", "blue"]),

### WeaviateDocumentIndex

`WeaviateDocumentIndex` is a document index that is built upon [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/) vector database.

Learn more here: https://docs.docarray.org/user_guide/storing/index_weaviate/


```python
# There's a small difference with the Weaviate backend compared to the others.
# Here, you need to 'mark' the field used for vector search with 'is_embedding=True'.
# So, let's create a new schema for Weaviate that takes care of this requirement.

from pydantic import Field


class WeaviateDoc(BaseDoc):
    title: str
    title_embedding: NdArray[32] = Field(is_embedding=True)
    year: int
    color: str
```

# Doctran: interrogate documents

Documents used in a vector store knowledge base are typically stored in a narrative or conversational format. However, most user queries are in question format. If we **convert documents into Q&A format** before vectorizing them, we can increase the likelihood of retrieving relevant documents, and decrease the likelihood of retrieving irrelevant documents.

We can accomplish this using the [Doctran](https://github.com/psychic-api/doctran) library, which uses OpenAI's function calling feature to "interrogate" documents.

See [this notebook](https://github.com/psychic-api/doctran/blob/main/benchmark.ipynb) for benchmarks on vector similarity scores for various queries based on raw documents versus interrogated documents.

# Doctran: language translation

Comparing documents through embeddings has the benefit of working across multiple languages. "Harrison says hello" and "Harrison dice hola" will occupy similar positions in the vector space because they have the same meaning semantically.

However, it can still be useful to use an LLM to **translate documents into other languages** before vectorizing them. This is especially helpful when users are expected to query the knowledge base in different languages, or when state-of-the-art embedding models are not available for a given language.

We can accomplish this using the [Doctran](https://github.com/psychic-api/doctran) library, which uses OpenAI's function calling feature to translate documents between languages.


```python
%pip install --upgrade --quiet  doctran

# Docugami
This notebook covers how to load documents from `Docugami`. It provides the advantages of using this system over alternative data loaders.

## Prerequisites
1. Install necessary python packages.
2. Grab an access token for your workspace, and make sure it is set as the `DOCUGAMI_API_KEY` environment variable.
3. Grab some docset and document IDs for your processed documents, as described here: https://help.docugami.com/home/docugami-api


```python
# You need the dgml-utils package to use the DocugamiLoader (run pip install directly without "poetry run" if you are not using poetry)
!poetry run pip install docugami-langchain dgml-utils==0.3.0 --upgrade --quiet
```

## Quick start

1. Create a [Docugami workspace](http://www.docugami.com) (free trials available)
2. Add your documents (PDF, DOCX or DOC) and allow Docugami to ingest and cluster them into sets of similar documents, e.g. NDAs, Lease Agreements, and Service Agreements. There is no fixed set of document types supported by the system, the clusters created depend on your particular documents, and you can [change the docset assignments](https://help.docugami.com/home/working-with-the-doc-sets-view) later.
3. Create an access token via the Developer Playground for your workspace. [Detailed instructions](https://help.docugami.com/home/docugami-api)
4. Explore the [Docugami API](https://api-docs.docugami.com) to get a list of your processed docset IDs, or just the document IDs for a particular docset. 
6. Use the DocugamiLoader as detailed below, to get rich semantic chunks for your documents.
7. Optionally, build and publish one or more [reports or abstracts](https://help.docugami.com/home/reports). This helps Docugami improve the semantic XML with better tags based on your preferences, which are then added to the DocugamiLoader output as metadata. Use techniques like [self-querying retriever](/docs/how_to/self_query) to do high accuracy Document QA.

## Advantages vs Other Chunking Techniques

Appropriate chunking of your documents is critical for retrieval from documents. Many chunking techniques exist, including simple ones that rely on whitespace and recursive chunk splitting based on character length. Docugami offers a different approach:

1. **Intelligent Chunking:** Docugami breaks down every document into a hierarchical semantic XML tree of chunks of varying sizes, from single words or numerical values to entire sections. These chunks follow the semantic contours of the document, providing a more meaningful representation than arbitrary length or simple whitespace-based chunking.
2. **Semantic Annotations:** Chunks are annotated with semantic tags that are coherent across the document set, facilitating consistent hierarchical queries across multiple documents, even if they are written and formatted differently. For example, in set of lease agreements, you can easily identify key provisions like the Landlord, Tenant, or Renewal Date, as well as more complex information such as the wording of any sub-lease provision or whether a specific jurisdiction has an exception section within a Termination Clause.
3. **Structured Representation:** In addition, the XML tree indicates the structural contours of every document, using attributes denoting headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, and other common elements, and does that consistently across all supported document formats, such as scanned PDFs or DOCX files. It appropriately handles long-form document characteristics like page headers/footers or multi-column flows for clean text extraction.
4. **Additional Metadata:** Chunks are also annotated with additional metadata, if a user has been using Docugami. This additional metadata can be used for high-accuracy Document QA without context window restrictions. See detailed code walk-through below.



```python
import os

from docugami_langchain.document_loaders import DocugamiLoader
```

## Load Documents

If the DOCUGAMI_API_KEY environment variable is set, there is no need to pass it in to the loader explicitly otherwise you can pass it in as the `access_token` parameter.


```python
DOCUGAMI_API_KEY = os.environ.get("DOCUGAMI_API_KEY")
```


```python
docset_id = "26xpy3aes7xp"
document_ids = ["d7jqdzcj50sj", "cgd1eacfkchw"]

# To load all docs in the given docset ID, just don't provide document_ids
loader = DocugamiLoader(docset_id=docset_id, document_ids=document_ids)
chunks = loader.load()
len(chunks)
```




    120



The `metadata` for each `Document` (really, a chunk of an actual PDF, DOC or DOCX) contains some useful additional information:

1. **id and source:** ID and Name of the file (PDF, DOC or DOCX) the chunk is sourced from within Docugami.
2. **xpath:** XPath inside the XML representation of the document, for the chunk. Useful for source citations directly to the actual chunk inside the document XML.
3. **structure:** Structural attributes of the chunk, e.g. h1, h2, div, table, td, etc. Useful to filter out certain kinds of chunks if needed by the caller.
4. **tag:** Semantic tag for the chunk, using various generative and extractive techniques. More details here: https://github.com/docugami/DFM-benchmarks

You can control chunking behavior by setting the following properties on the `DocugamiLoader` instance:

1. You can set min and max chunk size, which the system tries to adhere to with minimal truncation. You can set `loader.min_text_length` and `loader.max_text_length` to control these.
2. By default, only the text for chunks is returned. However, Docugami's XML knowledge graph has additional rich information including semantic tags for entities inside the chunk. Set `loader.include_xml_tags = True` if you want the additional xml metadata on the returned chunks.
3. In addition, you can set `loader.parent_hierarchy_levels` if you want Docugami to return parent chunks in the chunks it returns. The child chunks point to the parent chunks via the `loader.parent_id_key` value. This is useful e.g. with the [MultiVector Retriever](/docs/how_to/multi_vector) for [small-to-big](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihSiRrOUwmg) retrieval. See detailed example later in this notebook.


```python
loader.min_text_length = 64
loader.include_xml_tags = True
chunks = loader.load()

for chunk in chunks[:5]:
    print(chunk)
```

## Basic Use: Docugami Loader for Document QA

You can use the Docugami Loader like a standard loader for Document QA over multiple docs, albeit with much better chunks that follow the natural contours of the document. There are many great tutorials on how to do this, e.g. [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yPBVii7Ct0). We can just use the same code, but use the `DocugamiLoader` for better chunking, instead of loading text or PDF files directly with basic splitting techniques.


```python
!poetry run pip install --upgrade langchain-openai tiktoken langchain-chroma hnswlib
```


```python
# For this example, we already have a processed docset for a set of lease documents
loader = DocugamiLoader(docset_id="zo954yqy53wp")
chunks = loader.load()

# strip semantic metadata intentionally, to test how things work without semantic metadata
for chunk in chunks:
    stripped_metadata = chunk.metadata.copy()
    for key in chunk.metadata:
        if key not in ["name", "xpath", "id", "structure"]:
            # remove semantic metadata
            del stripped_metadata[key]
    chunk.metadata = stripped_metadata

print(len(chunks))

The documents returned by the loader are already split, so we don't need to use a text splitter. Optionally, we can use the metadata on each document, for example the structure or tag attributes, to do any post-processing we want.

We will just use the output of the `DocugamiLoader` as-is to set up a retrieval QA chain the usual way.

qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(

## Using Docugami Knowledge Graph for High Accuracy Document QA

One issue with large documents is that the correct answer to your question may depend on chunks that are far apart in the document. Typical chunking techniques, even with overlap, will struggle with providing the LLM sufficent context to answer such questions. With upcoming very large context LLMs, it may be possible to stuff a lot of tokens, perhaps even entire documents, inside the context but this will still hit limits at some point with very long documents, or a lot of documents.

For example, if we ask a more complex question that requires the LLM to draw on chunks from different parts of the document, even OpenAI's powerful LLM is unable to answer correctly.


```python
chain_response = qa_chain("What is rentable area for the property owned by DHA Group?")
chain_response["result"]  # correct answer should be 13,500 sq ft
```




    " I don't know."




```python
chain_response["source_documents"]
```




    [Document(page_content='1.6 Rentable Area of the Premises.', metadata={'id': '5b39a1ae84d51682328dca1467be211f', 'name': 'Sample Commercial Leases/Shorebucks LLC_WA.pdf', 'structure': 'lim h1', 'xpath': '/docset:OFFICELEASE-section/docset:OFFICELEASE-section/docset:OFFICELEASE/docset:WITNESSETH-section/docset:WITNESSETH/dg:chunk/dg:chunk/docset:BasicLeaseInformation/docset:BASICLEASEINFORMATIONANDDEFINEDTERMS-section/docset:BASICLEASEINFORMATIONANDDEFINEDTERMS/docset:CatalystGroup/dg:chunk[6]/dg:chunk'}),

At first glance the answer may seem reasonable, but it is incorrect. If you review the source chunks carefully for this answer, you will see that the chunking of the document did not end up putting the Landlord name and the rentable area in the same context, and produced irrelevant chunks therefore the answer is incorrect (should be **13,500 sq ft**)

Docugami can help here. Chunks are annotated with additional metadata created using different techniques if a user has been [using Docugami](https://help.docugami.com/home/reports). More technical approaches will be added later.

Specifically, let's ask Docugami to return XML tags on its output, as well as additional metadata:


```python
loader = DocugamiLoader(docset_id="zo954yqy53wp")
loader.include_xml_tags = (
    True  # for additional semantics from the Docugami knowledge graph
)
chunks = loader.load()
print(chunks[0].metadata)
```

    {'xpath': '/docset:OFFICELEASE-section/dg:chunk', 'id': '47297e277e556f3ce8b570047304560b', 'name': 'Sample Commercial Leases/Shorebucks LLC_AZ.pdf', 'source': 'Sample Commercial Leases/Shorebucks LLC_AZ.pdf', 'structure': 'h1 h1 p', 'tag': 'chunk Lease', 'Lease Date': 'March  29th , 2019', 'Landlord': 'Menlo Group', 'Tenant': 'Shorebucks LLC', 'Premises Address': '1564  E Broadway Rd ,  Tempe ,  Arizona  85282', 'Term of Lease': '96  full calendar months', 'Square Feet': '16,159'}
    

We can use a [self-querying retriever](/docs/how_to/self_query) to improve our query accuracy, using this additional metadata:


```python
!poetry run pip install --upgrade lark --quiet
```


```python
from langchain.chains.query_constructor.schema import AttributeInfo
from langchain.retrievers.self_query.base import SelfQueryRetriever
from langchain_chroma import Chroma

EXCLUDE_KEYS = ["id", "xpath", "structure"]
metadata_field_info = [
    AttributeInfo(
        name=key,
        description=f"The {key} for this chunk",
        type="string",
    )
    for key in chunks[0].metadata
    if key.lower() not in EXCLUDE_KEYS
]

document_content_description = "Contents of this chunk"
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)

vectordb = Chroma.from_documents(documents=chunks, embedding=embedding)
retriever = SelfQueryRetriever.from_llm(
    llm, vectordb, document_content_description, metadata_field_info, verbose=True
)
qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
    llm=OpenAI(),
    chain_type="stuff",
    retriever=retriever,
    return_source_documents=True,
    verbose=True,
)
```

Let's run the same question again. It returns the correct result since all the chunks have metadata key/value pairs on them carrying key information about the document even if this information is physically very far away from the source chunk used to generate the answer.


```python
qa_chain(
    "What is rentable area for the property owned by DHA Group?"
)  # correct answer should be 13,500 sq ft
```

This time the answer is correct, since the self-querying retriever created a filter on the landlord attribute of the metadata, correctly filtering to document that specifically is about the DHA Group landlord. The resulting source chunks are all relevant to this landlord, and this improves answer accuracy even though the landlord is not directly mentioned in the specific chunk that contains the correct answer.

# Advanced Topic: Small-to-Big Retrieval with Document Knowledge Graph Hierarchy

Documents are inherently semi-structured and the DocugamiLoader is able to navigate the semantic and structural contours of the document to provide parent chunk references on the chunks it returns. This is useful e.g. with the [MultiVector Retriever](/docs/how_to/multi_vector) for [small-to-big](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihSiRrOUwmg) retrieval.

To get parent chunk references, you can set `loader.parent_hierarchy_levels` to a non-zero value.


```python
from typing import Dict, List

from docugami_langchain.document_loaders import DocugamiLoader
from langchain_core.documents import Document

loader = DocugamiLoader(docset_id="zo954yqy53wp")
loader.include_xml_tags = (
    True  # for additional semantics from the Docugami knowledge graph
)
loader.parent_hierarchy_levels = 3  # for expanded context
loader.max_text_length = (
    1024 * 8
)  # 8K chars are roughly 2K tokens (ref: https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936856-what-are-tokens-and-how-to-count-them)
loader.include_project_metadata_in_doc_metadata = (
    False  # Not filtering on vector metadata, so remove to lighten the vectors
)
chunks: List[Document] = loader.load()

# build separate maps of parent and child chunks
parents_by_id: Dict[str, Document] = {}
children_by_id: Dict[str, Document] = {}
for chunk in chunks:
    chunk_id = chunk.metadata.get("id")
    parent_chunk_id = chunk.metadata.get(loader.parent_id_key)
    if not parent_chunk_id:
        # parent chunk
        parents_by_id[chunk_id] = chunk
    else:
        # child chunk
        children_by_id[chunk_id] = chunk
```


```python
# Explore some of the parent chunk relationships
for id, chunk in list(children_by_id.items())[:5]:
    parent_chunk_id = chunk.metadata.get(loader.parent_id_key)
    if parent_chunk_id:
        # child chunks have the parent chunk id set
        print(f"PARENT CHUNK {parent_chunk_id}: {parents_by_id[parent_chunk_id]}")
        print(f"CHUNK {id}: {chunk}")

## Docugami RAG over XML Knowledge Graphs (KG-RAG)

Many documents contain a mixture of content types, including text and tables. 

Semi-structured data can be challenging for conventional RAG for a few reasons since semantics may be lost by text-only chunking techniques, e.g.: 

* Text splitting may break up tables, corrupting the data in retrieval
* Embedding tables may pose challenges for semantic similarity search 

Docugami deconstructs documents into XML Knowledge Graphs consisting of hierarchical semantic chunks using the XML data model. This cookbook shows how to perform RAG using XML Knowledge Graphs as input (**KG-RAG**):

* We will use [Docugami](http://docugami.com/) to segment out text and table chunks from documents (PDF \[scanned or digital\], DOC or DOCX) including semantic XML markup in the chunks.
* We will use the [multi-vector retriever](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/multi_vector) to store raw tables and text (including semantic XML markup) along with table summaries better suited for retrieval.
* We will use [LCEL](https://python.langchain.com/docs/expression_language/) to implement the chains used.

The overall flow is here:

![image.png](image.png)

## Packages


```python
! pip install langchain docugami==0.0.8 dgml-utils==0.3.0 pydantic langchainhub langchain-chroma hnswlib --upgrade --quiet
```

Docugami processes documents in the cloud, so you don't need to install any additional local dependencies. 

## Data Loading

Let's use Docugami to process some documents. Here's what you need to get started:

1. Create a [Docugami workspace](http://www.docugami.com) (free trials available)
1. Create an access token via the Developer Playground for your workspace. [Detailed instructions](https://help.docugami.com/home/docugami-api).
1. Add your documents (PDF \[scanned or digital\], DOC or DOCX) to Docugami for processing. There are two ways to do this:
    1. Use the simple Docugami web experience. [Detailed instructions](https://help.docugami.com/home/adding-documents).
    1. Use the [Docugami API](https://api-docs.docugami.com), specifically the [documents](https://api-docs.docugami.com/#tag/documents/operation/upload-document) endpoint. You can also use the [docugami python library](https://pypi.org/project/docugami/) as a convenient wrapper.

Once your documents are in Docugami, they are processed and organized into sets of similar documents, e.g. NDAs, Lease Agreements, and Service Agreements. Docugami is not limited to any particular types of documents, and the clusters created depend on your particular documents. You can [change the docset assignments](https://help.docugami.com/home/working-with-the-doc-sets-view) later if you wish. You can monitor file status in the simple Docugami webapp, or use a [webhook](https://api-docs.docugami.com/#tag/webhooks) to be informed when your documents are done processing.

You can also use the [Docugami API](https://api-docs.docugami.com) or the  [docugami](https://pypi.org/project/docugami/) python library to do all the file processing without visiting the Docugami webapp except to get the API key.

> You can get an API key as documented here: https://help.docugami.com/home/docugami-api. This following code assumes you have set the `DOCUGAMI_API_TOKEN` environment variable.

First, let's define two simple helper methods to upload files and wait for them to finish processing.


```python
from pprint import pprint

from docugami import Docugami
from docugami.lib.upload import upload_to_named_docset, wait_for_dgml

#### START DOCSET INFO (please change this values as needed)
DOCSET_NAME = "NTSB Aviation Incident Reports"
FILE_PATHS = [
    "/Users/tjaffri/ntsb/Report_CEN23LA277_192541.pdf",
    "/Users/tjaffri/ntsb/Report_CEN23LA338_192753.pdf",
    "/Users/tjaffri/ntsb/Report_CEN23LA363_192876.pdf",
    "/Users/tjaffri/ntsb/Report_CEN23LA394_192995.pdf",
    "/Users/tjaffri/ntsb/Report_ERA23LA114_106615.pdf",
    "/Users/tjaffri/ntsb/Report_WPR23LA254_192532.pdf",
]

# Note: Please specify ~6 (or more!) similar files to process together as a document set
#       This is currently a requirement for Docugami to automatically detect motifs
#       across the document set to generate a semantic XML Knowledge Graph.
assert len(FILE_PATHS) > 5, "Please provide at least 6 files"
#### END DOCSET INFO

dg_client = Docugami()
dg_docs = upload_to_named_docset(dg_client, FILE_PATHS, DOCSET_NAME)
dgml_paths = wait_for_dgml(dg_client, dg_docs)

pprint(dgml_paths)
```

    {'Report_CEN23LA277_192541.pdf': '/tmp/tmpa0c77x46',
     'Report_CEN23LA338_192753.pdf': '/tmp/tmpaftfld2w',
     'Report_CEN23LA363_192876.pdf': '/tmp/tmpn7gp6be2',

If you are on the free Docugami tier, your files should be done in ~15 minutes or less depending on the number of pages uploaded and available resources (please contact Docugami for paid plans for faster processing). You can re-run the code above without reprocessing your files to continue waiting if your notebook is not continuously running (it does not re-upload).

### Partition PDF tables and text

You can use the [Docugami Loader](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/document_loaders/docugami) to very easily get chunks for your documents, including semantic and structural metadata. This is the simpler and recommended approach for most use cases but in this notebook let's explore using the `dgml-utils` library to explore the segmented output for this file in more detail by processing the XML we just downloaded above.


```python
from pathlib import Path

from dgml_utils.segmentation import get_chunks_str

# Here we just read the first file, you can do the same for others
dgml_path = dgml_paths[Path(FILE_PATHS[0]).name]

with open(dgml_path, "r") as file:
    contents = file.read().encode("utf-8")

    chunks = get_chunks_str(
        contents,
        include_xml_tags=True,  # Ensures Docugami XML semantic tags are included in the chunked output (set to False for text-only chunks and tables as Markdown)
        max_text_length=1024 * 8,  # 8k chars are ~2k tokens for OpenAI.
        # Ref: https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936856-what-are-tokens-and-how-to-count-them
    )

    print(f"found {len(chunks)} chunks, here are the first few")
    for chunk in chunks[:10]:
        print(chunk.text)
```

    found 30 chunks, here are the first few

If you want text based chunks instead, Docugami also supports those and renders tables as markdown:


```python
with open(dgml_path, "r") as file:
    contents = file.read().encode("utf-8")

    chunks = get_chunks_str(
        contents,
        include_xml_tags=False,  # text-only chunks and tables as Markdown
        max_text_length=1024
        * 8,  # 8k chars are ~2k tokens for OpenAI. Ref: https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936856-what-are-tokens-and-how-to-count-them
    )

    print(f"found {len(chunks)} chunks, here are the first few")
    for chunk in chunks[:10]:
        print(chunk.text)
```

    found 30 chunks, here are the first few

    Analysis
    The pilot reported that, as the tail lifted during takeoff, the airplane veered left. He attempted to correct with full right rudder and full brakes. However, the airplane subsequently nosed over resulting in substantial damage to the fuselage, lift struts, rudder, and vertical stabilizer.
    The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or anomalies with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.
    At about the time of the accident, wind was from 180 ° at 5 knots. The pilot decided to depart on runway 35 due to the prevailing airport traffic. He stated that departing with “more favorable wind conditions” may have prevented the accident.
    Probable Cause and Findings
    The National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:
    The pilot's loss of directional control during takeoff and subsequent excessive use of brakes which resulted in a nose-over. Contributing to the accident was his decision to takeoff downwind.

## Docugami XML Deep Dive: Jane Doe NDA Example

Let's explore the Docugami XML output for a different example PDF file (a long form contract): [Jane Doe NDA](https://github.com/docugami/dgml-utils/blob/main/python/tests/test_data/article/Jane%20Doe%20NDA.pdf). We have provided processed Docugami XML output for this PDF here: https://github.com/docugami/dgml-utils/blob/main/python/tests/test_data/article/Jane%20Doe.xml so you can follow along without processing your own documents.


```python
import requests

# Download XML from known URL
dgml = requests.get(
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docugami/dgml-utils/main/python/tests/test_data/article/Jane%20Doe.xml"
).text
chunks = get_chunks_str(dgml, include_xml_tags=True)
len(chunks)
```




    39




```python
# Count all the different structure categories
category_counts = {}

for element in chunks:
    category = element.structure
    if category in category_counts:
        category_counts[category] += 1
    else:
        category_counts[category] = 1

category_counts
```




    {'h1': 9, 'div': 12, 'p': 3, 'lim h1': 9, 'lim': 1, 'table': 1, 'h1 div': 4}




```python
# Tables
table_elements = [c for c in chunks if "table" in c.structure.split()]
print(f"There are {len(table_elements)} tables")

# Text
text_elements = [c for c in chunks if "table" not in c.structure.split()]
print(f"There are {len(text_elements)} text elements")
```

    There are 1 tables
    There are 38 text elements
    

The Docugami XML contains extremely detailed semantics and visual bounding boxes for all elements. The `dgml-utils` library parses text and non-text elements into formats appropriate to pass into LLMs (chunked text with XML semantic labels)


```python
for element in text_elements[:20]:
    print(element.text)
```

```

    <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> Authorized Individual </td> <td> Role </td> <td>Purpose of Disclosure </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <AuthorizedIndividualJohnSmith> <Name>John Smith </Name> </AuthorizedIndividualJohnSmith> </td> <td> <JohnSmithRole> <ProjectManagerName>Project Manager </ProjectManagerName> </JohnSmithRole> </td> <td> <JohnSmithPurposeofDisclosure> Oversee project to which the NDA relates </JohnSmithPurposeofDisclosure> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <AuthorizedIndividualLisaWhite> <Author>Lisa White </Author> </AuthorizedIndividualLisaWhite> </td> <td> <LisaWhiteRole> Lead Developer </LisaWhiteRole> </td> <td> <LisaWhitePurposeofDisclosure>Software development and analysis </LisaWhitePurposeofDisclosure> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <AuthorizedIndividualMichaelBrown> <Name>Michael Brown </Name> </AuthorizedIndividualMichaelBrown> </td> <td> <MichaelBrownRole> Financial <FinancialAnalyst> Analyst </FinancialAnalyst> </MichaelBrownRole> </td> <td> <MichaelBrownPurposeofDisclosure>Financial analysis and reporting </MichaelBrownPurposeofDisclosure> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table>
    

The XML markup contains structural as well as semantic tags, which provide additional semantics to the LLM for improved retrieval and generation.

If you prefer, you can set `include_xml_tags=False` in the `get_chunks_str` call above to not include XML markup. The text-only Docugami chunks are still very good since they follow the structural and semantic contours of the document rather than whitespace-only chunking. Tables are rendered as markdown in this case, so that some structural context is maintained even without the XML markup.


```python
chunks_as_text = get_chunks_str(dgml, include_xml_tags=False)
table_elements_as_text = [c for c in chunks_as_text if "table" in c.structure.split()]

print(table_elements_as_text[0].text)
```

## Multi-vector retriever

Use [multi-vector-retriever](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/multi_vector#summary) to produce summaries of tables and, optionally, text. 

With the summary, we will also store the raw table elements.

The summaries are used to improve the quality of retrieval, [as explained in the multi vector retriever docs](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/multi_vector).

The raw tables are passed to the LLM, providing the full table context for the LLM to generate the answer.  

### Summaries


```python
from langchain.prompts import (
    ChatPromptTemplate,
    HumanMessagePromptTemplate,
    SystemMessagePromptTemplate,
)
from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
```

We create a simple summarize chain for each element.

You can also see, re-use, or modify the prompt in the Hub [here](https://smith.langchain.com/hub/rlm/multi-vector-retriever-summarization).

```
from langchain import hub
obj = hub.pull("rlm/multi-vector-retriever-summarization")
```


```python
# Prompt
prompt_text = """You are an assistant tasked with summarizing tables and text. \ 
Give a concise summary of the table or text. Table or text chunk: {element} """
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(prompt_text)

# Summary chain
model = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model="gpt-4")
summarize_chain = {"element": lambda x: x} | prompt | model | StrOutputParser()
```


```python
# Apply summarizer to tables
tables = [i.text for i in table_elements]
table_summaries = summarize_chain.batch(tables, {"max_concurrency": 5})
```

### Add to vectorstore

Use [Multi Vector Retriever](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/multi_vector#summary) with summaries: 

* `InMemoryStore` stores the raw text, tables
* `vectorstore` stores the embedded summaries


```python
import uuid

from langchain.retrievers.multi_vector import MultiVectorRetriever
from langchain.storage import InMemoryStore
from langchain_chroma import Chroma
from langchain_core.documents import Document
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings


def build_retriever(text_elements, tables, table_summaries):
    # The vectorstore to use to index the child chunks
    vectorstore = Chroma(
        collection_name="summaries", embedding_function=OpenAIEmbeddings()
    )

    # The storage layer for the parent documents
    store = InMemoryStore()
    id_key = "doc_id"

    # The retriever (empty to start)
    retriever = MultiVectorRetriever(
        vectorstore=vectorstore,
        docstore=store,
        id_key=id_key,
    )

    # Add texts
    texts = [i.text for i in text_elements]
    doc_ids = [str(uuid.uuid4()) for _ in texts]
    retriever.docstore.mset(list(zip(doc_ids, texts)))

    # Add tables and summaries
    table_ids = [str(uuid.uuid4()) for _ in tables]
    summary_tables = [
        Document(page_content=s, metadata={id_key: table_ids[i]})
        for i, s in enumerate(table_summaries)
    ]
    retriever.vectorstore.add_documents(summary_tables)
    retriever.docstore.mset(list(zip(table_ids, tables)))
    return retriever


retriever = build_retriever(text_elements, tables, table_summaries)
```

## RAG

Run [RAG pipeline](https://python.langchain.com/docs/expression_language/cookbook/retrieval).


```python
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnablePassthrough

system_prompt = SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(
    "You are a helpful assistant that answers questions based on provided context. Your provided context can include text or tables, "
    "and may also contain semantic XML markup. Pay attention the semantic XML markup to understand more about the context semantics as "
    "well as structure (e.g. lists and tabular layouts expressed with HTML-like tags)"
)

human_prompt = HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(
    """Context:

    {context}

    Question: {question}"""
)


def build_chain(retriever, model):
    prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([system_prompt, human_prompt])

    # LLM
    model = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model="gpt-4")

    # RAG pipeline
    chain = (
        {"context": retriever, "question": RunnablePassthrough()}
        | prompt
        | model
        | StrOutputParser()
    )

    return chain


chain = build_chain(retriever, model)
```


```python
result = chain.invoke(
    "Name all the people authorized to receive confidential information, and their roles"
)
print(result)
```

    Number of requested results 4 is greater than number of elements in index 1, updating n_results = 1
    

    The people authorized to receive confidential information and their roles are:
    
    1. John Smith - Project Manager
    2. Lisa White - Lead Developer
    3. Michael Brown - Financial Analyst
    

We can check the [trace](https://smith.langchain.com/public/21b3aa16-4ef3-40c3-92f6-3f0ceab2aedb/r) to see what chunks were retrieved.

This includes Table 1 in the doc, showing the disclosures table as XML markup (same one as above)

# RAG on Llama2 paper

Let's run the same Llama2 paper example from the [Semi_Structured_RAG.ipynb](./Semi_Structured_RAG.ipynb) notebook to see if we get the same results, and to contrast the table chunk returned by Docugami with the ones returned from Unstructured.


```python
dgml = requests.get(
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docugami/dgml-utils/main/python/tests/test_data/arxiv/2307.09288.xml"
).text
llama2_chunks = get_chunks_str(dgml, include_xml_tags=True)
len(llama2_chunks)
```




    669




```python
# Tables
llama2_table_elements = [c for c in llama2_chunks if "table" in c.structure.split()]
print(f"There are {len(llama2_table_elements)} tables")

# Text
llama2_text_elements = [c for c in llama2_chunks if "table" not in c.structure.split()]
print(f"There are {len(llama2_text_elements)} text elements")
```

    There are 33 tables
    There are 636 text elements
    


```python
# Apply summarizer to tables
llama2_tables = [i.text for i in llama2_table_elements]
llama2_table_summaries = summarize_chain.batch(llama2_tables, {"max_concurrency": 5})
```


```python
llama2_retriever = build_retriever(
    llama2_text_elements, llama2_tables, llama2_table_summaries
)
```


```python
llama2_chain = build_chain(llama2_retriever, model)
```


```python
llama2_chain.invoke("What is the number of training tokens for LLaMA2?")
```




    'The number of training tokens for LLaMA2 is 2.0T for all parameter sizes.'



We can check the [trace](https://smith.langchain.com/public/5de100c3-bb40-4234-bf02-64bc708686a1/r) to see what chunks were retrieved.

This includes Table 1 in the doc, showing the tokens used for training table as semantic XML markup:

            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
```

Finally, you can ask other questions that rely on more subtle parsing of the table, e.g.:


```python
llama2_chain.invoke("What was the learning rate for LLaMA2?")
```




    'The learning rate for LLaMA2 was 3.0 × 10−4 for the 7B and 13B models, and 1.5 × 10−4 for the 34B and 70B models.'



## Docugami KG-RAG Template

Docugami also provides a [langchain template](https://github.com/docugami/langchain-template-docugami-kg-rag) that you can integrate into your langchain projects.

Here's a walkthrough of how you can do this.

# Amazon Document DB

>[Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB Compatibility)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/documentdb/) makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale MongoDB-compatible databases in the cloud.
> With Amazon DocumentDB, you can run the same application code and use the same drivers and tools that you use with MongoDB.
> Vector search for Amazon DocumentDB combines the flexibility and rich querying capability of a JSON-based document database with the power of vector search.


This notebook shows you how to use [Amazon Document DB Vector Search](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/documentdb/latest/developerguide/vector-search.html) to store documents in collections, create indicies and perform vector search queries using approximate nearest neighbor algorithms such "cosine", "euclidean", and "dotProduct". By default, DocumentDB creates Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) indexes. To learn about other supported vector index types, please refer to the document linked above.

To use DocumentDB, you must first deploy a cluster. Please refer to the [Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/documentdb/latest/developerguide/what-is.html) for more details.

```python
!pip install pymongo
```


```python
import getpass

# DocumentDB connection string
# i.e., "mongodb://{username}:{pass}@{cluster_endpoint}:{port}/?{params}"
CONNECTION_STRING = getpass.getpass("DocumentDB Cluster URI:")

INDEX_NAME = "izzy-test-index"
NAMESPACE = "izzy_test_db.izzy_test_collection"
DB_NAME, COLLECTION_NAME = NAMESPACE.split(".")
```

We want to use `OpenAIEmbeddings` so we need to set up our OpenAI environment variables. 


```python
import getpass
import os

# Set up the OpenAI Environment Variables
if "OPENAI_API_KEY" not in os.environ:
    os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("OpenAI API Key:")
os.environ["OPENAI_EMBEDDINGS_DEPLOYMENT"] = (
    "smart-agent-embedding-ada"  # the deployment name for the embedding model
)
os.environ["OPENAI_EMBEDDINGS_MODEL_NAME"] = "text-embedding-ada-002"  # the model name
```

Now, we will load the documents into the collection, create the index, and then perform queries against the index.

    Tonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you’re at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections. 
    
    Tonight, I’d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer—an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service. 
    
    One of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court. 
    
    And I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation’s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence.
    

Once the documents have been loaded and the index has been created, you can now instantiate the vector store directly and run queries against the index


```python
vectorstore = DocumentDBVectorSearch.from_connection_string(
    connection_string=CONNECTION_STRING,
    namespace=NAMESPACE,
    embedding=openai_embeddings,
    index_name=INDEX_NAME,
)

# perform a similarity search between a query and the ingested documents
query = "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"
docs = vectorstore.similarity_search(query)
```


```python
print(docs[0].page_content)
```

print(docs[0].page_content)
```

    And unlike the $2 Trillion tax cut passed in the previous administration that benefitted the top 1% of Americans, the American Rescue Plan helped working people—and left no one behind. 
    
    And it worked. It created jobs. Lots of jobs. 
    
    In fact—our economy created over 6.5 Million new jobs just last year, more jobs created in one year  
    than ever before in the history of America. 
    
    Our economy grew at a rate of 5.7% last year, the strongest growth in nearly 40 years, the first step in bringing fundamental change to an economy that hasn’t worked for the working people of this nation for too long.  
    
    For the past 40 years we were told that if we gave tax breaks to those at the very top, the benefits would trickle down to everyone else. 
    
    But that trickle-down theory led to weaker economic growth, lower wages, bigger deficits, and the widest gap between those at the top and everyone else in nearly a century.
    

## Question Answering


```python
qa_retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(
    search_type="similarity",
    search_kwargs={"k": 25},
)
```


```python
from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate

prompt_template = """Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.

{context}

Question: {question}
"""
PROMPT = PromptTemplate(
    template=prompt_template, input_variables=["context", "question"]
)
```


```python
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
from langchain_openai import OpenAI

qa = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
    llm=OpenAI(),
    chain_type="stuff",
    retriever=qa_retriever,
    return_source_documents=True,

# Document Augmentation through Question Generation for Enhanced Retrieval

## Overview

This implementation demonstrates a text augmentation technique that leverages additional question generation to improve document retrieval within a vector database. By generating and incorporating various questions related to each text fragment, the system enhances the standard retrieval process, thus increasing the likelihood of finding relevant documents that can be utilized as context for generative question answering.

## Motivation

By enriching text fragments with related questions, we aim to significantly enhance the accuracy of identifying the most relevant sections of a document that contain answers to user queries.

## Prerequisites

This approach utilizes OpenAI's language models and embeddings. You'll need an OpenAI API key to use this implementation. Make sure you have the required Python packages installed:

```
pip install langchain openai faiss-cpu PyPDF2 pydantic
```

## Key Components

1. **PDF Processing and Text Chunking**: Handling PDF documents and dividing them into manageable text fragments.
2. **Question Augmentation**: Generating relevant questions at both the document and fragment levels using OpenAI's language models.
3. **Vector Store Creation**: Calculating embeddings for documents using OpenAI's embedding model and creating a FAISS vector store.
4. **Retrieval and Answer Generation**: Finding the most relevant document using FAISS and generating answers based on the context provided.

## Method Details

### Document Preprocessing

1. Convert the PDF to a string using PyPDFLoader from LangChain.
2. Split the text into overlapping text documents (text_document) for building context purpose and then each document to overlapping text fragments (text_fragment) for retrieval and semantic search purpose.

### Document Augmentation

1. Generate questions at the document or text fragment level using OpenAI's language models.
2. Configure the number of questions to generate using the QUESTIONS_PER_DOCUMENT constant.

### Vector Store Creation

1. Use the OpenAIEmbeddings class to compute document embeddings.
2. Create a FAISS vector store from these embeddings.

### Retrieval and Generation

1. Retrieve the most relevant document from the FAISS store based on the given query.
2. Use the retrieved document as context for generating answers with OpenAI's language models.

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Enhanced Retrieval Process**: Increases the probability of finding the most relevant FAISS document for a given query.
2. **Flexible Context Adjustment**: Allows for easy adjustment of the context window size for both text documents and fragments.
3. **High-Quality Language Understanding**: Leverages OpenAI's powerful language models for question generation and answer production.

## Implementation Details

- The `OpenAIEmbeddingsWrapper` class provides a consistent interface for embedding generation.
- The `generate_questions` function uses OpenAI's chat models to create relevant questions from the text.
- The `process_documents` function handles the core logic of document splitting, question generation, and vector store creation.
- The main execution demonstrates loading a PDF, processing its content, and performing a sample query.

## Conclusion

This technique provides a method to improve the quality of information retrieval in vector-based document search systems. By generating additional questions similar to user queries and utilizing OpenAI's advanced language models, it potentially leads to better comprehension and more accurate responses in subsequent tasks, such as question answering.

## Note on API Usage

Be aware that this implementation uses OpenAI's API, which may incur costs based on usage. Make sure to monitor your API usage and set appropriate limits in your OpenAI account settings.

### Example


```python

# Load sample PDF document to string variable
path = "../data/Understanding_Climate_Change.pdf"
content = read_pdf_to_string(path)

# Instantiate OpenAI Embeddings class that will be used by FAISS
embedding_model = OpenAIEmbeddings()

# Process documents and create retriever
document_query_retriever = process_documents(content, embedding_model)

# Example usage of the retriever
query = "What is climate change?"
retrieved_docs = document_query_retriever.get_relevant_documents(query)
print(f"\nQuery: {query}")
print(f"Retrieved document: {retrieved_docs[0].page_content}")
```

### Find the most relevant FAISS document in the store. In most cases, this will be an augmented question rather than the original text document.


```python
query = "How do freshwater ecosystems change due to alterations in climatic factors?"
print (f'Question:{os.linesep}{query}{os.linesep}')
retrieved_documents = document_query_retriever.invoke(query)

for doc in retrieved_documents:
    print_document("Relevant fragment retrieved", doc)
```

### Find the parent text document and use it as context for the generative model to generate an answer to the question.


```python
context = doc.metadata['text']
print (f'{os.linesep}Context:{os.linesep}{context}')
answer = generate_answer(context, query)
print(f'{os.linesep}Answer:{os.linesep}{answer}')
```

# How to load CSVs

A [comma-separated values (CSV)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) file is a delimited text file that uses a comma to separate values. Each line of the file is a data record. Each record consists of one or more fields, separated by commas.

LangChain implements a [CSV Loader](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/document_loaders/langchain_community.document_loaders.csv_loader.CSVLoader.html) that will load CSV files into a sequence of [Document](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/core/documents/langchain_core.documents.base.Document.html#langchain_core.documents.base.Document) objects. Each row of the CSV file is translated to one document.


```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders.csv_loader import CSVLoader

file_path = "../integrations/document_loaders/example_data/mlb_teams_2012.csv"

loader = CSVLoader(file_path=file_path)
data = loader.load()

for record in data[:2]:
    print(record)
```

    page_content='Team: Nationals\n"Payroll (millions)": 81.34\n"Wins": 98' metadata={'source': '../../../docs/integrations/document_loaders/example_data/mlb_teams_2012.csv', 'row': 0}
    page_content='Team: Reds\n"Payroll (millions)": 82.20\n"Wins": 97' metadata={'source': '../../../docs/integrations/document_loaders/example_data/mlb_teams_2012.csv', 'row': 1}
    

## Customizing the CSV parsing and loading

`CSVLoader` will accept a `csv_args` kwarg that supports customization of arguments passed to Python's `csv.DictReader`. See the [csv module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html) documentation for more information of what csv args are supported.


```python
loader = CSVLoader(
    file_path=file_path,
    csv_args={
        "delimiter": ",",
        "quotechar": '"',
        "fieldnames": ["MLB Team", "Payroll in millions", "Wins"],
    },
)

data = loader.load()
for record in data[:2]:
    print(record)
```

    page_content='MLB Team: Team\nPayroll in millions: "Payroll (millions)"\nWins: "Wins"' metadata={'source': '../../../docs/integrations/document_loaders/example_data/mlb_teams_2012.csv', 'row': 0}
    page_content='MLB Team: Nationals\nPayroll in millions: 81.34\nWins: 98' metadata={'source': '../../../docs/integrations/document_loaders/example_data/mlb_teams_2012.csv', 'row': 1}
    

## Specify a column to identify the document source

The `"source"` key on [Document](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/core/documents/langchain_core.documents.base.Document.html#langchain_core.documents.base.Document) metadata can be set using a column of the CSV. Use the `source_column` argument to specify a source for the document created from each row. Otherwise `file_path` will be used as the source for all documents created from the CSV file.

This is useful when using documents loaded from CSV files for chains that answer questions using sources.


```python
loader = CSVLoader(file_path=file_path, source_column="Team")

data = loader.load()
for record in data[:2]:
    print(record)
```

    page_content='Team: Nationals\n"Payroll (millions)": 81.34\n"Wins": 98' metadata={'source': 'Nationals', 'row': 0}
    page_content='Team: Reds\n"Payroll (millions)": 82.20\n"Wins": 97' metadata={'source': 'Reds', 'row': 1}
    

## Load from a string

Python's `tempfile` can be used when working with CSV strings directly.


```python
import tempfile
from io import StringIO

string_data = """
"Team", "Payroll (millions)", "Wins"
"Nationals",     81.34, 98
"Reds",          82.20, 97
"Yankees",      197.96, 95
"Giants",       117.62, 94
""".strip()


with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False, mode="w+") as temp_file:
    temp_file.write(string_data)
    temp_file_path = temp_file.name

loader = CSVLoader(file_path=temp_file_path)
data = loader.load()
for record in data[:2]:
    print(record)
```

    page_content='Team: Nationals\n"Payroll (millions)": 81.34\n"Wins": 98' metadata={'source': 'Nationals', 'row': 0}
    page_content='Team: Reds\n"Payroll (millions)": 82.20\n"Wins": 97' metadata={'source': 'Reds', 'row': 1}

# How to create a custom Document Loader

## Overview


Applications based on LLMs frequently entail extracting data from databases or files, like PDFs, and converting it into a format that LLMs can utilize. In LangChain, this usually involves creating Document objects, which encapsulate the extracted text (`page_content`) along with metadata—a dictionary containing details about the document, such as the author's name or the date of publication.

`Document` objects are often formatted into prompts that are fed into an LLM, allowing the LLM to use the information in the `Document` to generate a desired response (e.g., summarizing the document).
`Documents` can be either used immediately or indexed into a vectorstore for future retrieval and use.

The main abstractions for Document Loading are:


| Component      | Description                    |
|----------------|--------------------------------|
| Document       | Contains `text` and `metadata` |
| BaseLoader     | Use to convert raw data into `Documents`  |
| Blob           | A representation of binary data that's located either in a file or in memory |
| BaseBlobParser | Logic to parse a `Blob` to yield `Document` objects |

This guide will demonstrate how to write custom document loading and file parsing logic; specifically, we'll see how to:

1. Create a standard document Loader by sub-classing from `BaseLoader`.
2. Create a parser using  `BaseBlobParser` and use it in conjunction with `Blob` and `BlobLoaders`. This is useful primarily when working with files.

## Standard Document Loader

A document loader can be implemented by sub-classing from a `BaseLoader` which provides a standard interface for loading documents.

### Interface 

| Method Name | Explanation |
|-------------|-------------|
| lazy_load   | Used to load documents one by one **lazily**. Use for production code. |
| alazy_load  | Async variant of `lazy_load` |
| load        | Used to load all the documents into memory **eagerly**. Use for prototyping or interactive work. |
| aload       | Used to load all the documents into memory **eagerly**. Use for prototyping or interactive work. **Added in 2024-04 to LangChain.** |

* The `load` methods is a convenience method meant solely for prototyping work -- it just invokes `list(self.lazy_load())`.
* The `alazy_load` has a default implementation that will delegate to `lazy_load`. If you're using async, we recommend overriding the default implementation and providing a native async implementation.

:::important
When implementing a document loader do **NOT** provide parameters via the `lazy_load` or `alazy_load` methods.

All configuration is expected to be passed through the initializer (__init__). This was a design choice made by LangChain to make sure that once a document loader has been instantiated it has all the information needed to load documents.
:::


### Implementation

Let's create an example of a standard document loader that loads a file and creates a document from each line in the file.


```python
from typing import AsyncIterator, Iterator

from langchain_core.document_loaders import BaseLoader
from langchain_core.documents import Document


class CustomDocumentLoader(BaseLoader):
    """An example document loader that reads a file line by line."""

    def __init__(self, file_path: str) -> None:
        """Initialize the loader with a file path.

        Args:
            file_path: The path to the file to load.
        """
        self.file_path = file_path

    def lazy_load(self) -> Iterator[Document]:  # <-- Does not take any arguments
        """A lazy loader that reads a file line by line.

        When you're implementing lazy load methods, you should use a generator
        to yield documents one by one.
        """
        with open(self.file_path, encoding="utf-8") as f:
            line_number = 0
            for line in f:
                yield Document(
                    page_content=line,
                    metadata={"line_number": line_number, "source": self.file_path},
                )
                line_number += 1

    # alazy_load is OPTIONAL.
    # If you leave out the implementation, a default implementation which delegates to lazy_load will be used!
    async def alazy_load(
        self,
    ) -> AsyncIterator[Document]:  # <-- Does not take any arguments
        """An async lazy loader that reads a file line by line."""
        # Requires aiofiles (install with pip)
        # https://github.com/Tinche/aiofiles
        import aiofiles

        async with aiofiles.open(self.file_path, encoding="utf-8") as f:
            line_number = 0
            async for line in f:
                yield Document(
                    page_content=line,
                    metadata={"line_number": line_number, "source": self.file_path},
                )
                line_number += 1
```

### Test 🧪


To test out the document loader, we need a file with some quality content.


```python
with open("./meow.txt", "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    quality_content = "meow meow🐱 \n meow meow🐱 \n meow😻😻"
    f.write(quality_content)

loader = CustomDocumentLoader("./meow.txt")
```


```python
## Test out the lazy load interface
for doc in loader.lazy_load():
    print()
    print(type(doc))
    print(doc)
```

    
    <class 'langchain_core.documents.base.Document'>
    page_content='meow meow🐱 \n' metadata={'line_number': 0, 'source': './meow.txt'}
    
    <class 'langchain_core.documents.base.Document'>
    page_content=' meow meow🐱 \n' metadata={'line_number': 1, 'source': './meow.txt'}
    
    <class 'langchain_core.documents.base.Document'>
    page_content=' meow😻😻' metadata={'line_number': 2, 'source': './meow.txt'}
    


```python
## Test out the async implementation
async for doc in loader.alazy_load():
    print()
    print(type(doc))
    print(doc)
```

    
    <class 'langchain_core.documents.base.Document'>
    page_content='meow meow🐱 \n' metadata={'line_number': 0, 'source': './meow.txt'}
    
    <class 'langchain_core.documents.base.Document'>
    page_content=' meow meow🐱 \n' metadata={'line_number': 1, 'source': './meow.txt'}
    
    <class 'langchain_core.documents.base.Document'>
    page_content=' meow😻😻' metadata={'line_number': 2, 'source': './meow.txt'}
    

:::tip

`load()` can be helpful in an interactive environment such as a jupyter notebook.

Avoid using it for production code since eager loading assumes that all the content
can fit into memory, which is not always the case, especially for enterprise data.
:::


```python
loader.load()
```




    [Document(page_content='meow meow🐱 \n', metadata={'line_number': 0, 'source': './meow.txt'}),
     Document(page_content=' meow meow🐱 \n', metadata={'line_number': 1, 'source': './meow.txt'}),
     Document(page_content=' meow😻😻', metadata={'line_number': 2, 'source': './meow.txt'})]



## Working with Files

Many document loaders involve parsing files. The difference between such loaders usually stems from how the file is parsed, rather than how the file is loaded. For example, you can use `open` to read the binary content of either a PDF or a markdown file, but you need different parsing logic to convert that binary data into text.

As a result, it can be helpful to decouple the parsing logic from the loading logic, which makes it easier to re-use a given parser regardless of how the data was loaded.

### BaseBlobParser

A `BaseBlobParser` is an interface that accepts a `blob` and outputs a list of `Document` objects. A `blob` is a representation of data that lives either in memory or in a file. LangChain python has a `Blob` primitive which is inspired by the [Blob WebAPI spec](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob).


```python
from langchain_core.document_loaders import BaseBlobParser, Blob


class MyParser(BaseBlobParser):
    """A simple parser that creates a document from each line."""

    def lazy_parse(self, blob: Blob) -> Iterator[Document]:
        """Parse a blob into a document line by line."""
        line_number = 0
        with blob.as_bytes_io() as f:
            for line in f:
                line_number += 1
                yield Document(
                    page_content=line,
                    metadata={"line_number": line_number, "source": blob.source},
                )
```


```python
blob = Blob.from_path("./meow.txt")
parser = MyParser()
```


```python
list(parser.lazy_parse(blob))
```




    [Document(page_content='meow meow🐱 \n', metadata={'line_number': 1, 'source': './meow.txt'}),
     Document(page_content=' meow meow🐱 \n', metadata={'line_number': 2, 'source': './meow.txt'}),
     Document(page_content=' meow😻😻', metadata={'line_number': 3, 'source': './meow.txt'})]



Using the **blob** API also allows one to load content directly from memory without having to read it from a file!


```python
blob = Blob(data=b"some data from memory\nmeow")
list(parser.lazy_parse(blob))
```




    [Document(page_content='some data from memory\n', metadata={'line_number': 1, 'source': None}),
     Document(page_content='meow', metadata={'line_number': 2, 'source': None})]



### Blob

Let's take a quick look through some of the Blob API.


```python
blob = Blob.from_path("./meow.txt", metadata={"foo": "bar"})
```


```python
blob.encoding
```




    'utf-8'




```python
blob.as_bytes()
```




    b'meow meow\xf0\x9f\x90\xb1 \n meow meow\xf0\x9f\x90\xb1 \n meow\xf0\x9f\x98\xbb\xf0\x9f\x98\xbb'




```python
blob.as_string()
```




    'meow meow🐱 \n meow meow🐱 \n meow😻😻'




```python
blob.as_bytes_io()
```




    <contextlib._GeneratorContextManager at 0x743f34324450>




```python
blob.metadata
```




    {'foo': 'bar'}




```python
blob.source
```




    './meow.txt'



### Blob Loaders

While a parser encapsulates the logic needed to parse binary data into documents, *blob loaders* encapsulate the logic that's necessary to load blobs from a given storage location.

A the moment, `LangChain` only supports `FileSystemBlobLoader`.

You can use the `FileSystemBlobLoader` to load blobs and then use the parser to parse them.


```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders.blob_loaders import FileSystemBlobLoader

blob_loader = FileSystemBlobLoader(path=".", glob="*.mdx", show_progress=True)
```


```python
parser = MyParser()
for blob in blob_loader.yield_blobs():
    for doc in parser.lazy_parse(blob):
        print(doc)
        break
```

    page_content='# HTML\n' metadata={'line_number': 1, 'source': 'html.mdx'}
    

### Generic Loader

LangChain has a `GenericLoader` abstraction which composes a `BlobLoader` with a `BaseBlobParser`.

`GenericLoader` is meant to provide standardized classmethods that make it easy to use existing `BlobLoader` implementations. At the moment, only the `FileSystemBlobLoader` is supported.


```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders.generic import GenericLoader

loader = GenericLoader.from_filesystem(
    path=".", glob="*.mdx", show_progress=True, parser=MyParser()
)

for idx, doc in enumerate(loader.lazy_load()):
    if idx < 5:
        print(doc)

print("... output truncated for demo purposes")
```


      0%|          | 0/8 [00:00<?, ?it/s]


    page_content='# Microsoft Office\n' metadata={'line_number': 1, 'source': 'office_file.mdx'}
    page_content='\n' metadata={'line_number': 2, 'source': 'office_file.mdx'}
    page_content='>[The Microsoft Office](https://www.office.com/) suite of productivity software includes Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft PowerPoint, Microsoft Outlook, and Microsoft OneNote. It is available for Microsoft Windows and macOS operating systems. It is also available on Android and iOS.\n' metadata={'line_number': 3, 'source': 'office_file.mdx'}
    page_content='\n' metadata={'line_number': 4, 'source': 'office_file.mdx'}
    page_content='This covers how to load commonly used file formats including `DOCX`, `XLSX` and `PPTX` documents into a document format that we can use downstream.\n' metadata={'line_number': 5, 'source': 'office_file.mdx'}
    ... output truncated for demo purposes
    

#### Custom Generic Loader

If you really like creating classes, you can sub-class and create a class to encapsulate the logic together.

You can sub-class from this class to load content using an existing loader.


```python
from typing import Any


class MyCustomLoader(GenericLoader):
    @staticmethod
    def get_parser(**kwargs: Any) -> BaseBlobParser:
        """Override this method to associate a default parser with the class."""
        return MyParser()
```


```python
loader = MyCustomLoader.from_filesystem(path=".", glob="*.mdx", show_progress=True)

for idx, doc in enumerate(loader.lazy_load()):
    if idx < 5:
        print(doc)

print("... output truncated for demo purposes")
```


      0%|          | 0/8 [00:00<?, ?it/s]


    page_content='# Microsoft Office\n' metadata={'line_number': 1, 'source': 'office_file.mdx'}
    page_content='\n' metadata={'line_number': 2, 'source': 'office_file.mdx'}
    page_content='>[The Microsoft Office](https://www.office.com/) suite of productivity software includes Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft PowerPoint, Microsoft Outlook, and Microsoft OneNote.

    page_content='\n' metadata={'line_number': 4, 'source': 'office_file.mdx'}

# How to load documents from a directory

LangChain's [DirectoryLoader](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/document_loaders/langchain_community.document_loaders.directory.DirectoryLoader.html) implements functionality for reading files from disk into LangChain [Document](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/core/documents/langchain_core.documents.base.Document.html#langchain_core.documents.base.Document) objects. Here we demonstrate:

- How to load from a filesystem, including use of wildcard patterns;
- How to use multithreading for file I/O;
- How to use custom loader classes to parse specific file types (e.g., code);
- How to handle errors, such as those due to decoding.


```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import DirectoryLoader
```

`DirectoryLoader` accepts a `loader_cls` kwarg, which defaults to [UnstructuredLoader](/docs/integrations/document_loaders/unstructured_file). [Unstructured](https://unstructured-io.github.io/unstructured/) supports parsing for a number of formats, such as PDF and HTML. Here we use it to read in a markdown (.md) file.

We can use the `glob` parameter to control which files to load. Note that here it doesn't load the `.rst` file or the `.html` files.


```python
loader = DirectoryLoader("../", glob="**/*.md")
docs = loader.load()
len(docs)
```




    20




```python
print(docs[0].page_content[:100])
```

    Security
    
    LangChain has a large ecosystem of integrations with various external resources like local
    

## Show a progress bar

By default a progress bar will not be shown. To show a progress bar, install the `tqdm` library (e.g. `pip install tqdm`), and set the `show_progress` parameter to `True`.


```python
loader = DirectoryLoader("../", glob="**/*.md", show_progress=True)
docs = loader.load()
```

    100%|█████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████| 20/20 [00:00<00:00, 54.56it/s]
    

## Use multithreading

By default the loading happens in one thread. In order to utilize several threads set the `use_multithreading` flag to true.


```python
loader = DirectoryLoader("../", glob="**/*.md", use_multithreading=True)
docs = loader.load()
```

## Change loader class
By default this uses the `UnstructuredLoader` class. To customize the loader, specify the loader class in the `loader_cls` kwarg. Below we show an example using [TextLoader](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/document_loaders/langchain_community.document_loaders.text.TextLoader.html):


```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import TextLoader

loader = DirectoryLoader("../", glob="**/*.md", loader_cls=TextLoader)
docs = loader.load()
```


```python
print(docs[0].page_content[:100])
```

    # Security
    
    LangChain has a large ecosystem of integrations with various external resources like loc
    

Notice that while the `UnstructuredLoader` parses Markdown headers, `TextLoader` does not.

If you need to load Python source code files, use the `PythonLoader`:


```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import PythonLoader

loader = DirectoryLoader("../../../../../", glob="**/*.py", loader_cls=PythonLoader)
```

## Auto-detect file encodings with TextLoader

`DirectoryLoader` can help manage errors due to variations in file encodings. Below we will attempt to load in a collection of files, one of which includes non-UTF8 encodings.


```python
path = "../../../libs/langchain/tests/unit_tests/examples/"

loader = DirectoryLoader(path, glob="**/*.txt", loader_cls=TextLoader)
```

### A. Default Behavior

By default we raise an error:


```python
loader.load()
```

    Error loading file ../../../../libs/langchain/tests/unit_tests/examples/example-non-utf8.txt

    RuntimeError: Error loading ../../../../libs/langchain/tests/unit_tests/examples/example-non-utf8.txt


The file `example-non-utf8.txt` uses a different encoding, so the `load()` function fails with a helpful message indicating which file failed decoding.

With the default behavior of `TextLoader` any failure to load any of the documents will fail the whole loading process and no documents are loaded.

### B. Silent fail

We can pass the parameter `silent_errors` to the `DirectoryLoader` to skip the files which could not be loaded and continue the load process.


```python
loader = DirectoryLoader(
    path, glob="**/*.txt", loader_cls=TextLoader, silent_errors=True
)
docs = loader.load()
```

    Error loading file ../../../../libs/langchain/tests/unit_tests/examples/example-non-utf8.txt: Error loading ../../../../libs/langchain/tests/unit_tests/examples/example-non-utf8.txt
    


```python
doc_sources = [doc.metadata["source"] for doc in docs]
doc_sources
```




    ['../../../../libs/langchain/tests/unit_tests/examples/example-utf8.txt']



### C. Auto detect encodings

We can also ask `TextLoader` to auto detect the file encoding before failing, by passing the `autodetect_encoding` to the loader class.


```python
text_loader_kwargs = {"autodetect_encoding": True}
loader = DirectoryLoader(
    path, glob="**/*.txt", loader_cls=TextLoader, loader_kwargs=text_loader_kwargs
)
docs = loader.load()
```


```python
doc_sources = [doc.metadata["source"] for doc in docs]
doc_sources
```




    ['../../../../libs/langchain/tests/unit_tests/examples/example-utf8.txt',
     '../../../../libs/langchain/tests/unit_tests/examples/example-non-utf8.txt']

# How to load HTML

The HyperText Markup Language or [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.

This covers how to load `HTML` documents into a LangChain [Document](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/core/documents/langchain_core.documents.base.Document.html#langchain_core.documents.base.Document) objects that we can use downstream.

Parsing HTML files often requires specialized tools. Here we demonstrate parsing via [Unstructured](https://unstructured-io.github.io/unstructured/) and [BeautifulSoup4](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which can be installed via pip. Head over to the integrations page to find integrations with additional services, such as [Azure AI Document Intelligence](/docs/integrations/document_loaders/azure_document_intelligence) or [FireCrawl](/docs/integrations/document_loaders/firecrawl).

## Loading HTML with Unstructured


```python
%pip install unstructured
```


```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import UnstructuredHTMLLoader

file_path = "../../docs/integrations/document_loaders/example_data/fake-content.html"

loader = UnstructuredHTMLLoader(file_path)
data = loader.load()

print(data)
```

    [Document(page_content='My First Heading\n\nMy first paragraph.', metadata={'source': '../../docs/integrations/document_loaders/example_data/fake-content.html'})]
    

## Loading HTML with BeautifulSoup4

We can also use `BeautifulSoup4` to load HTML documents using the `BSHTMLLoader`.  This will extract the text from the HTML into `page_content`, and the page title as `title` into `metadata`.


```python
%pip install bs4
```


```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import BSHTMLLoader

loader = BSHTMLLoader(file_path)
data = loader.load()

print(data)
```

    [Document(page_content='\nTest Title\n\n\nMy First Heading\nMy first paragraph.\n\n\n', metadata={'source': '../../docs/integrations/document_loaders/example_data/fake-content.html', 'title': 'Test Title'})]

# How to load Markdown

[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor.

Here we cover how to load `Markdown` documents into LangChain [Document](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/core/documents/langchain_core.documents.base.Document.html#langchain_core.documents.base.Document) objects that we can use downstream.

We will cover:

- Basic usage;
- Parsing of Markdown into elements such as titles, list items, and text.

LangChain implements an [UnstructuredMarkdownLoader](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/document_loaders/langchain_community.document_loaders.markdown.UnstructuredMarkdownLoader.html) object which requires the [Unstructured](https://unstructured-io.github.io/unstructured/) package. First we install it:


```python
%pip install "unstructured[md]" nltk
```

Basic usage will ingest a Markdown file to a single document. Here we demonstrate on LangChain's readme:


```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import UnstructuredMarkdownLoader
from langchain_core.documents import Document

markdown_path = "../../../README.md"
loader = UnstructuredMarkdownLoader(markdown_path)

data = loader.load()
assert len(data) == 1
assert isinstance(data[0], Document)
readme_content = data[0].page_content
print(readme_content[:250])
```

## Retain Elements

Under the hood, Unstructured creates different "elements" for different chunks of text. By default we combine those together, but you can easily keep that separation by specifying `mode="elements"`.


```python
loader = UnstructuredMarkdownLoader(markdown_path, mode="elements")

data = loader.load()
print(f"Number of documents: {len(data)}\n")

for document in data[:2]:
    print(f"{document}\n")
```

    Number of documents: 66
    
    page_content='🦜️🔗 LangChain' metadata={'source': '../../../README.md', 'category_depth': 0, 'last_modified': '2024-06-28T15:20:01', 'languages': ['eng'], 'filetype': 'text/markdown', 'file_directory': '../../..', 'filename': 'README.md', 'category': 'Title'}
    
    page_content='⚡ Build context-aware reasoning applications ⚡' metadata={'source': '../../../README.md', 'last_modified': '2024-06-28T15:20:01', 'languages': ['eng'], 'parent_id': '200b8a7d0dd03f66e4f13456566d2b3a', 'filetype': 'text/markdown', 'file_directory': '../../..', 'filename': 'README.md', 'category': 'NarrativeText'}
    
    

Note that in this case we recover three distinct element types:


```python
print(set(document.metadata["category"] for document in data))
```

    {'ListItem', 'NarrativeText', 'Title'}
    


```python

```

# How to load PDFs

[Portable Document Format (PDF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF), standardized as ISO 32000, is a file format developed by Adobe in 1992 to present documents, including text formatting and images, in a manner independent of application software, hardware, and operating systems.

This guide covers how to load `PDF` documents into the LangChain [Document](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/core/documents/langchain_core.documents.base.Document.html) format that we use downstream.

Text in PDFs is typically represented via text boxes. They may also contain images. A PDF parser might do some combination of the following:

- Agglomerate text boxes into lines, paragraphs, and other structures via heuristics or ML inference;
- Run [OCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition) on images to detect text therein;
- Classify text as belonging to paragraphs, lists, tables, or other structures;
- Structure text into table rows and columns, or key-value pairs.

LangChain integrates with a host of PDF parsers. Some are simple and relatively low-level; others will support OCR and image-processing, or perform advanced document layout analysis. The right choice will depend on your needs. Below we enumerate the possibilities.

We will demonstrate these approaches on a [sample file](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/blob/master/libs/community/tests/integration_tests/examples/layout-parser-paper.pdf):


```python
file_path = (
    "../../docs/integrations/document_loaders/example_data/layout-parser-paper.pdf"
)
```

:::info A note on multimodal models

Many modern LLMs support inference over multimodal inputs (e.g., images). In some applications -- such as question-answering over PDFs with complex layouts, diagrams, or scans -- it may be advantageous to skip the PDF parsing, instead casting a PDF page to an image and passing it to a model directly. We demonstrate an example of this in the [Use of multimodal models](/docs/how_to/document_loader_pdf/#use-of-multimodal-models) section below.

:::

## Simple and fast text extraction

If you are looking for a simple string representation of text that is embedded in a PDF, the method below is appropriate. It will return a list of [Document](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/core/documents/langchain_core.documents.base.Document.html) objects-- one per page-- containing a single string of the page's text in the Document's `page_content` attribute. It will not parse text in images or scanned PDF pages. Under the hood it uses the [pypdf](https://pypdf.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) Python library.

LangChain [document loaders](/docs/concepts/document_loaders) implement `lazy_load` and its async variant, `alazy_load`, which return iterators of `Document` objects. We will use these below.


```python
%pip install -qU pypdf
```


```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import PyPDFLoader

loader = PyPDFLoader(file_path)
pages = []
async for page in loader.alazy_load():
    pages.append(page)
```


```python
print(f"{pages[0].metadata}\n")
print(pages[0].page_content)
```

    Abstract. Recent advances in document image analysis (DIA) have been
    primarily driven by the application of neural networks. Ideally, research
    outcomes could be easily deployed in production and extended for further
    investigation. However, various factors like loosely organized codebases
    and sophisticated model conﬁgurations complicate the easy reuse of im-
    portant innovations by a wide audience. Though there have been on-going
    eﬀorts to improve reusability and simplify deep learning (DL) model
    development in disciplines like natural language processing and computer
    vision, none of them are optimized for challenges in the domain of DIA.
    This represents a major gap in the existing toolkit, as DIA is central to
    academic research across a wide range of disciplines in the social sciences
    and humanities. This paper introduces LayoutParser , an open-source
    library for streamlining the usage of DL in DIA research and applica-
    tions. The core LayoutParser library comes with a set of simple and
    intuitive interfaces for applying and customizing DL models for layout de-
    tection, character recognition, and many other document processing tasks.
    To promote extensibility, LayoutParser also incorporates a community
    platform for sharing both pre-trained models and full document digiti-
    zation pipelines. We demonstrate that LayoutParser is helpful for both
    lightweight and large-scale digitization pipelines in real-word use cases.

    1 Introduction
    Deep Learning(DL)-based approaches are the state-of-the-art for a wide range of
    document image analysis (DIA) tasks including document image classiﬁcation [ 11,arXiv:2103.15348v2  [cs.CV]  21 Jun 2021
    

Note that the metadata of each document stores the corresponding page number.

### Vector search over PDFs

Once we have loaded PDFs into LangChain `Document` objects, we can index them (e.g., a RAG application) in the usual way. Below we use OpenAI embeddings, although any LangChain [embeddings](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/embedding_models) model will suffice.


```python
%pip install -qU langchain-openai
```


```python
import getpass
import os

if "OPENAI_API_KEY" not in os.environ:
    os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("OpenAI API Key:")
```


```python
from langchain_core.vectorstores import InMemoryVectorStore
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings

vector_store = InMemoryVectorStore.from_documents(pages, OpenAIEmbeddings())
docs = vector_store.similarity_search("What is LayoutParser?", k=2)
for doc in docs:
    print(f'Page {doc.metadata["page"]}: {doc.page_content[:300]}\n')
```

## Layout analysis and extraction of text from images

If you require a more granular segmentation of text (e.g., into distinct paragraphs, titles, tables, or other structures) or require extraction of text from images, the method below is appropriate. It will return a list of [Document](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/core/documents/langchain_core.documents.base.Document.html) objects, where each object represents a structure on the page. The Document's metadata stores the page number and other information related to the object (e.g., it might store table rows and columns in the case of a table object).

Under the hood it uses the `langchain-unstructured` library. See the [integration docs](/docs/integrations/document_loaders/unstructured_file/) for more information about using [Unstructured](https://docs.unstructured.io/welcome) with LangChain.

Unstructured supports multiple parameters for PDF parsing:
- `strategy` (e.g., `"fast"` or `"hi-res"`)
- API or local processing. You will need an API key to use the API.

The [hi-res](https://docs.unstructured.io/api-reference/how-to/choose-hi-res-model) strategy provides support for document layout analysis and OCR. We demonstrate it below via the API. See [local parsing](/docs/how_to/document_loader_pdf/#local-parsing) section below for considerations when running locally.


```python
%pip install -qU langchain-unstructured
```


```python
import getpass
import os

if "UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY" not in os.environ:
    os.environ["UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("Unstructured API Key:")
```

    Unstructured API Key: ········
    

As before, we initialize a loader and load documents lazily:


```python
from langchain_unstructured import UnstructuredLoader

loader = UnstructuredLoader(
    file_path=file_path,
    strategy="hi_res",
    partition_via_api=True,
    coordinates=True,
)
docs = []
for doc in loader.lazy_load():
    docs.append(doc)
```

    INFO: Preparing to split document for partition.
    INFO: Starting page number set to 1
    INFO: Allow failed set to 0
    INFO: Concurrency level set to 5
    INFO: Splitting pages 1 to 16 (16 total)
    INFO: Determined optimal split size of 4 pages.
    INFO: Partitioning 4 files with 4 page(s) each.
    INFO: Partitioning set #1 (pages 1-4).
    INFO: Partitioning set #2 (pages 5-8).

    INFO: Successfully partitioned set #3, elements added to the final result.

Here we recover 171 distinct structures over the 16 page document:


```python
print(len(docs))
```

    171
    

We can use the document metadata to recover content from a single page:


```python
first_page_docs = [doc for doc in docs if doc.metadata.get("page_number") == 1]

for doc in first_page_docs:
    print(doc.page_content)
```

### Extracting tables and other structures

Each `Document` we load represents a structure, like a title, paragraph, or table.

Some structures may be of special interest for indexing or question-answering tasks. These structures may be:
1. Classified for easy identification;
2. Parsed into a more structured representation.

Below, we identify and extract a table:

    1 For each dataset, we train several models of diﬀerent sizes for diﬀerent needs (the trade-oﬀ between accuracy vs. computational cost). For “base model” and “large model”, we refer to using the ResNet 50 or ResNet 101 backbones [13], respectively. One can train models of diﬀerent architectures, like Faster R-CNN [28] (F) and Mask R-CNN [12] (M). For example, an F in the Large Model column indicates it has a Faster R-CNN model trained using the ResNet 101 backbone. The platform is maintained and a number of additions will be made to the model zoo in coming months.
    
    layout data structures, which are optimized for eﬃciency and versatility. 3) When necessary, users can employ existing or customized OCR models via the uniﬁed API provided in the OCR module. 4) LayoutParser comes with a set of utility functions for the visualization and storage of the layout data. 5) LayoutParser is also highly customizable, via its integration with functions for layout data annotation and model training. We now provide detailed descriptions for each component.
    
    3.1 Layout Detection Models
    
    In LayoutParser, a layout model takes a document image as an input and generates a list of rectangular boxes for the target content regions. Diﬀerent from traditional methods, it relies on deep convolutional neural networks rather than manually curated rules to identify content regions. It is formulated as an object detection problem and state-of-the-art models like Faster R-CNN [28] and Mask R-CNN [12] are used. This yields prediction results of high accuracy and makes it possible to build a concise, generalized interface for layout detection. LayoutParser, built upon Detectron2 [35], provides a minimal API that can perform layout detection with only four lines of code in Python:
    
    1 import layoutparser as lp 2 image = cv2 . imread ( " image_file " ) # load images 3 model = lp . De t e c tro n2 Lay outM odel ( " lp :// PubLayNet / f as t er _ r c nn _ R _ 50 _ F P N_ 3 x / config " ) 4 5 layout = model . detect ( image )
    
    LayoutParser provides a wealth of pre-trained model weights using various datasets covering diﬀerent languages, time periods, and document types. Due to domain shift [7], the prediction performance can notably drop when models are ap- plied to target samples that are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the training dataset. As document structures and layouts vary greatly in diﬀerent domains, it is important to select models trained on a dataset similar to the test samples. A semantic syntax is used for initializing the model weights in LayoutParser, using both the dataset name and model name lp://<dataset-name>/<model-architecture-name>.
    
    

Note that although the table text is collapsed into a single string in the document's content, the metadata contains a representation of its rows and columns:


```python
from IPython.display import HTML, display

segments = [
    doc.metadata
    for doc in docs
    if doc.metadata.get("page_number") == 5 and doc.metadata.get("category") == "Table"
]

display(HTML(segments[0]["text_as_html"]))
```

### Extracting text from specific sections

Structures may have parent-child relationships -- for example, a paragraph might belong to a section with a title. If a section is of particular interest (e.g., for indexing) we can isolate the corresponding `Document` objects.

Below, we extract all text associated with the document's "Conclusion" section:


```python
render_page(docs, 14, print_text=False)
```


    
![png](output_29_0.png)
    



```python
conclusion_docs = []
parent_id = -1
for doc in docs:
    if doc.metadata["category"] == "Title" and "Conclusion" in doc.page_content:
        parent_id = doc.metadata["element_id"]
    if doc.metadata.get("parent_id") == parent_id:
        conclusion_docs.append(doc)

for doc in conclusion_docs:
    print(doc.page_content)
```

    LayoutParser provides a comprehensive toolkit for deep learning-based document image analysis. The oﬀ-the-shelf library is easy to install, and can be used to build ﬂexible and accurate pipelines for processing documents with complicated structures. It also supports high-level customization and enables easy labeling and training of DL models on unique document image datasets. The LayoutParser community platform facilitates sharing DL models and DIA pipelines, inviting discussion and promoting code reproducibility and reusability. The LayoutParser team is committed to keeping the library updated continuously and bringing the most recent advances in DL-based DIA, such as multi-modal document modeling [37, 36, 9] (an upcoming priority), to a diverse audience of end-users.

    LayoutParser: A Uniﬁed Toolkit for DL-Based DIA
    
    focuses on precision, eﬃciency, and robustness. The target documents may have complicated structures, and may require training multiple layout detection models to achieve the optimal accuracy. Light-weight pipelines are built for relatively simple documents, with an emphasis on development ease, speed and ﬂexibility. Ideally one only needs to use existing resources, and model training should be avoided. Through two exemplar projects, we show how practitioners in both academia and industry can easily build such pipelines using LayoutParser and extract high-quality structured document data for their downstream tasks. The source code for these projects will be publicly available in the LayoutParser community hub.

    5.1 A Comprehensive Historical Document Digitization Pipeline
    
    The digitization of historical documents can unlock valuable data that can shed light on many important social, economic, and historical questions. Yet due to scan noises, page wearing, and the prevalence of complicated layout structures, ob- taining a structured representation of historical document scans is often extremely complicated. In this example, LayoutParser was used to develop a comprehensive pipeline, shown in Figure 5, to gener- ate high-quality structured data from historical Japanese ﬁrm ﬁnancial ta- bles with complicated layouts. The pipeline applies two layout models to identify diﬀerent levels of document structures and two customized OCR engines for optimized character recog- nition accuracy.

    As shown in Figure 4 (a), the document contains columns of text written vertically 15, a common style in Japanese. Due to scanning noise and archaic printing technology, the columns can be skewed or have vari- able widths, and hence cannot be eas- ily identiﬁed via rule-based methods. Within each column, words are sepa- rated by white spaces of variable size, and the vertical positions of objects can be an indicator of their layout type.

Note that the text from the figure on the right is extracted and incorporated into the content of the `Document`.

### Local parsing

Parsing locally requires the installation of additional dependencies.

**Poppler** (PDF analysis)
- Linux: `apt-get install poppler-utils`
- Mac: `brew install poppler`
- Windows: https://github.com/oschwartz10612/poppler-windows

**Tesseract** (OCR)
- Linux: `apt-get install tesseract-ocr`
- Mac: `brew install tesseract`
- Windows: https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki#tesseract-installer-for-windows

We will also need to install the `unstructured` PDF extras:


```python
%pip install -qU "unstructured[pdf]"
```

We can then use the [UnstructuredLoader](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/unstructured/document_loaders/langchain_unstructured.document_loaders.UnstructuredLoader.html) much the same way, forgoing the API key and `partition_via_api` setting:


```python
loader_local = UnstructuredLoader(
    file_path=file_path,
    strategy="hi_res",
)
docs_local = []
for doc in loader_local.lazy_load():
    docs_local.append(doc)
```

    WARNING: This function will be deprecated in a future release and `unstructured` will simply use the DEFAULT_MODEL from `unstructured_inference.model.base` to set default model name

The list of documents can then be processed similarly to those obtained from the API.

## Use of multimodal models

Many modern LLMs support inference over multimodal inputs (e.g., images). In some applications-- such as question-answering over PDFs with complex layouts, diagrams, or scans-- it may be advantageous to skip the PDF parsing, instead casting a PDF page to an image and passing it to a model directly. This allows a model to reason over the two dimensional content on the page, instead of a "one-dimensional" string representation.

In principle we can use any LangChain [chat model](/docs/concepts/chat_models) that supports multimodal inputs. A list of these models is documented [here](/docs/integrations/chat/). Below we use OpenAI's `gpt-4o-mini`.

First we define a short utility function to convert a PDF page to a base64-encoded image:


```python
%pip install -qU PyMuPDF pillow langchain-openai
```


```python
import base64
import io

import fitz
from PIL import Image


def pdf_page_to_base64(pdf_path: str, page_number: int):
    pdf_document = fitz.open(pdf_path)
    page = pdf_document.load_page(page_number - 1)  # input is one-indexed
    pix = page.get_pixmap()
    img = Image.frombytes("RGB", [pix.width, pix.height], pix.samples)

    buffer = io.BytesIO()
    img.save(buffer, format="PNG")

    return base64.b64encode(buffer.getvalue()).decode("utf-8")
```


```python
from IPython.display import Image as IPImage
from IPython.display import display

base64_image = pdf_page_to_base64(file_path, 11)
display(IPImage(data=base64.b64decode(base64_image)))
```


    
![png](output_41_0.png)
    


We can then query the model in the [usual way](/docs/how_to/multimodal_inputs/). Below we ask it a question on related to the diagram on the page.


```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini")
```


```python
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage

query = "What is the name of the first step in the pipeline?"

message = HumanMessage(
    content=[
        {"type": "text", "text": query},
        {
            "type": "image_url",
            "image_url": {"url": f"data:image/jpeg;base64,{base64_image}"},
        },
    ],
)
response = llm.invoke([message])
print(response.content)
```

    INFO: HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
    

    The first step in the pipeline is "Annotate Layout Dataset."

# How to load web pages

This guide covers how to load web pages into the LangChain [Document](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/core/documents/langchain_core.documents.base.Document.html) format that we use downstream. Web pages contain text, images, and other multimedia elements, and are typically represented with HTML. They may include links to other pages or resources.

LangChain integrates with a host of parsers that are appropriate for web pages. The right parser will depend on your needs. Below we demonstrate two possibilities:

- [Simple and fast](/docs/how_to/document_loader_web#simple-and-fast-text-extraction) parsing, in which we recover one `Document` per web page with its content represented as a "flattened" string;
- [Advanced](/docs/how_to/document_loader_web#advanced-parsing) parsing, in which we recover multiple `Document` objects per page, allowing one to identify and traverse sections, links, tables, and other structures.

## Setup

For the "simple and fast" parsing, we will need `langchain-community` and the `beautifulsoup4` library:


```python
%pip install -qU langchain-community beautifulsoup4
```

For advanced parsing, we will use `langchain-unstructured`:


```python
%pip install -qU langchain-unstructured
```

## Simple and fast text extraction

If you are looking for a simple string representation of text that is embedded in a web page, the method below is appropriate. It will return a list of `Document` objects -- one per page -- containing a single string of the page's text. Under the hood it uses the `beautifulsoup4` Python library.

LangChain document loaders implement `lazy_load` and its async variant, `alazy_load`, which return iterators of `Document objects`. We will use these below.


```python
import bs4
from langchain_community.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader

page_url = "https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/chatbots_memory/"

loader = WebBaseLoader(web_paths=[page_url])
docs = []
async for doc in loader.alazy_load():
    docs.append(doc)

assert len(docs) == 1
doc = docs[0]
```

    USER_AGENT environment variable not set, consider setting it to identify your requests.
    


```python
print(f"{doc.metadata}\n")
print(doc.page_content[:500].strip())
```

This is essentially a dump of the text from the page's HTML. It may contain extraneous information like headings and navigation bars. If you are familiar with the expected HTML, you can specify desired `<div>` classes and other parameters via BeautifulSoup. Below we parse only the body text of the article:


```python
loader = WebBaseLoader(
    web_paths=[page_url],
    bs_kwargs={
        "parse_only": bs4.SoupStrainer(class_="theme-doc-markdown markdown"),
    },
    bs_get_text_kwargs={"separator": " | ", "strip": True},
)

docs = []
async for doc in loader.alazy_load():
    docs.append(doc)

assert len(docs) == 1
doc = docs[0]
```


```python
print(f"{doc.metadata}\n")
print(doc.page_content[:500])
```

    {'source': 'https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/chatbots_memory/'}
    
    How to add memory to chatbots | A key feature of chatbots is their ability to use content of previous conversation turns as context. This state management can take several forms, including: | Simply stuffing previous messages into a chat model prompt. | The above, but trimming old messages to reduce the amount of distracting information the model has to deal with. | More complex modifications like synthesizing summaries for long running conversations. | We'll go into more detail on a few techniq

    a greeting. Nemo then asks the AI how it is doing, and the AI responds that it is fine.'), | HumanMessage(content='What did I say my name was?'), | AIMessage(content='You introduced yourself as Nemo. How can I assist you today, Nemo?')] | Note that invoking the chain again will generate another summary generated from the initial summary plus new messages and so on. You could also design a hybrid approach where a certain number of messages are retained in chat history while others are summarized.
    

Note that this required advance technical knowledge of how the body text is represented in the underlying HTML.

We can parameterize `WebBaseLoader` with a variety of settings, allowing for specification of request headers, rate limits, and parsers and other kwargs for BeautifulSoup. See its [API reference](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/document_loaders/langchain_community.document_loaders.web_base.WebBaseLoader.html) for detail.

## Advanced parsing

This method is appropriate if we want more granular control or processing of the page content. Below, instead of generating one `Document` per page and controlling its content via BeautifulSoup, we generate multiple `Document` objects representing distinct structures on a page. These structures can include section titles and their corresponding body texts, lists or enumerations, tables, and more.

Under the hood it uses the `langchain-unstructured` library. See the [integration docs](/docs/integrations/document_loaders/unstructured_file/) for more information about using [Unstructured](https://docs.unstructured.io/welcome) with LangChain.


```python
from langchain_unstructured import UnstructuredLoader

page_url = "https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/chatbots_memory/"
loader = UnstructuredLoader(web_url=page_url)

docs = []
async for doc in loader.alazy_load():
    docs.append(doc)
```

    INFO: Note: NumExpr detected 12 cores but "NUMEXPR_MAX_THREADS" not set, so enforcing safe limit of 8.
    INFO: NumExpr defaulting to 8 threads.
    

Note that with no advance knowledge of the page HTML structure, we recover a natural organization of the body text:


```python
for doc in docs[:5]:
    print(doc.page_content)
```

    How to add memory to chatbots
    A key feature of chatbots is their ability to use content of previous conversation turns as context. This state management can take several forms, including:
    Simply stuffing previous messages into a chat model prompt.
    The above, but trimming old messages to reduce the amount of distracting information the model has to deal with.
    More complex modifications like synthesizing summaries for long running conversations.
    ERROR! Session/line number was not unique in database. History logging moved to new session 2747
    

### Extracting content from specific sections

Each `Document` object represents an element of the page. Its metadata contains useful information, such as its category:


```python
for doc in docs[:5]:
    print(f'{doc.metadata["category"]}: {doc.page_content}')
```

    Title: How to add memory to chatbots
    NarrativeText: A key feature of chatbots is their ability to use content of previous conversation turns as context. This state management can take several forms, including:
    ListItem: Simply stuffing previous messages into a chat model prompt.
    ListItem: The above, but trimming old messages to reduce the amount of distracting information the model has to deal with.
    ListItem: More complex modifications like synthesizing summaries for long running conversations.
    

Elements may also have parent-child relationships -- for example, a paragraph might belong to a section with a title. If a section is of particular interest (e.g., for indexing) we can isolate the corresponding `Document` objects.

As an example, below we load the content of the "Setup" sections for two web pages:


```python
from typing import List

from langchain_core.documents import Document


async def _get_setup_docs_from_url(url: str) -> List[Document]:
    loader = UnstructuredLoader(web_url=url)

    setup_docs = []
    parent_id = -1
    async for doc in loader.alazy_load():
        if doc.metadata["category"] == "Title" and doc.page_content.startswith("Setup"):
            parent_id = doc.metadata["element_id"]
        if doc.metadata.get("parent_id") == parent_id:
            setup_docs.append(doc)

    return setup_docs


page_urls = [
    "https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/chatbots_memory/",
    "https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/chatbots_tools/",
]
setup_docs = []
for url in page_urls:
    page_setup_docs = await _get_setup_docs_from_url(url)
    setup_docs.extend(page_setup_docs)
```


```python
from collections import defaultdict

setup_text = defaultdict(str)

for doc in setup_docs:
    url = doc.metadata["url"]
    setup_text[url] += f"{doc.page_content}\n"

dict(setup_text)
```

### Vector search over page content

Once we have loaded the page contents into LangChain `Document` objects, we can index them (e.g., for a RAG application) in the usual way. Below we use OpenAI [embeddings](/docs/concepts/embedding_models), although any LangChain embeddings model will suffice.


```python
%pip install -qU langchain-openai
```


```python
import getpass
import os

if "OPENAI_API_KEY" not in os.environ:
    os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("OpenAI API Key:")
```


```python

## Overview

In today's information-driven world, the volume of digital documents generated daily is staggering. From emails and reports to legal contracts and scientific papers, businesses and individuals alike are inundated with vast amounts of textual data. Extracting meaningful insights from these documents efficiently and accurately has become a paramount challenge.

Document processing involves a range of tasks, including text extraction, classification, summarization, and translation, among others. Traditional methods often rely on rule-based algorithms or statistical models, which may struggle with the nuances and complexities of natural language.

Generative AI offers a promising alternative to understand, generate, and manipulate text using natural language prompting. Gemini on Vertex AI allows these models to be used in a scalable manner through:

- [Vertex AI Studio](https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-studio) in the Cloud Console
- [Vertex AI REST API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest)
- [Vertex AI SDK for Python](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/python-sdk/use-vertex-ai-python-sdk-ref)
- [Other client libraries](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/start/client-libraries)

This notebook focuses on using the **Vertex AI SDK for Python** to call the Gemini API in Vertex AI with the Gemini 1.5 Flash model.

For more information, see the [Generative AI on Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/learn/overview) documentation.


### Objectives

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use the Gemini API in Vertex AI with the Vertex AI SDK for Python to process PDF documents.

You will complete the following tasks:

- Install the Vertex AI SDK for Python
- Use the Gemini API in Vertex AI to interact with Gemini 1.5 Flash (`gemini-1.5-flash`) model:
  - Extract structured entities from an unstructured document
  - Classify document types
  - Combine classification and entity extraction into a single workflow
  - Summarize documents


### Costs

This tutorial uses billable components of Google Cloud:

- Vertex AI

Learn about [Vertex AI pricing](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/pricing) and use the [Pricing Calculator](https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator/) to generate a cost estimate based on your projected usage.


## Getting Started


### Install Vertex AI SDK for Python



```
%pip install --upgrade --user --quiet google-cloud-aiplatform
```

### Restart current runtime

To use the newly installed packages in this Jupyter runtime, you must restart the runtime. You can do this by running the cell below, which will restart the current kernel.


```
# Restart kernel after installs so that your environment can access the new packages
import IPython

app = IPython.Application.instance()
app.kernel.do_shutdown(True)
```

<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning">
<b>⚠️ The kernel is going to restart. Please wait until it is finished before continuing to the next step. ⚠️</b>
</div>


### Authenticate your notebook environment (Colab only)

If you are running this notebook on Google Colab, run the following cell to authenticate your environment. This step is not required if you are using [Vertex AI Workbench](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai-workbench).



```
import sys

# Additional authentication is required for Google Colab
if "google.colab" in sys.modules:
    # Authenticate user to Google Cloud
    from google.colab import auth

    auth.authenticate_user()
```

### Set Google Cloud project information and initialize Vertex AI SDK

To get started using Vertex AI, you must have an existing Google Cloud project and [enable the Vertex AI API](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=aiplatform.googleapis.com).

Learn more about [setting up a project and a development environment](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/start/cloud-environment).


```
# Define project information
PROJECT_ID = "YOUR_PROJECT_ID"  # @param {type:"string"}
LOCATION = "us-central1"  # @param {type:"string"}

# Initialize Vertex AI
import vertexai

vertexai.init(project=PROJECT_ID, location=LOCATION)
```

### Import libraries



```
import json

from IPython.display import Markdown, display_pdf
from vertexai.generative_models import (
    GenerationConfig,
    GenerativeModel,
    HarmBlockThreshold,
    HarmCategory,
    Part,
)
```

### Load the Gemini 1.5 Flash model

Gemini 1.5 Flash (`gemini-1.5-flash`) is a multimodal model that supports multimodal prompts. You can include text, image(s), and video in your prompt requests and get text or code responses.


```
model = GenerativeModel(
    "gemini-1.5-flash",
    safety_settings={
        HarmCategory.HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT: HarmBlockThreshold.BLOCK_ONLY_HIGH
    },
)
# This Generation Config sets the model to respond in JSON format.
generation_config = GenerationConfig(
    temperature=0.0, response_mime_type="application/json"
)
```

### Define helper function

Define helper function to print the multimodal prompt


```
PDF_MIME_TYPE = "application/pdf"


def print_multimodal_prompt(contents: list) -> None:
    """
    Given contents that would be sent to Gemini,
    output the full multimodal prompt for ease of readability.
    """
    for content in contents:
        if not isinstance(content, Part):
            print(content)
        elif content.inline_data:
            display_pdf(content.inline_data.data)
        elif content.file_data:
            gcs_url = (
                "https://storage.googleapis.com/"
                + content.file_data.file_uri.replace("gs://", "").replace(" ", "%20")
            )
            print(f"PDF URL: {gcs_url}")


# Send Google Cloud Storage Document to Vertex AI
def process_document(
    prompt: str,
    file_uri: str,
    mime_type: str = PDF_MIME_TYPE,
    generation_config: GenerationConfig | None = None,
    print_prompt: bool = False,
    print_raw_response: bool = False,
) -> str:
    # Load file directly from Google Cloud Storage
    file_part = Part.from_uri(
        uri=file_uri,
        mime_type=mime_type,
    )

    # Load contents
    contents = [file_part, prompt]

    # Send to Gemini
    response = model.generate_content(contents, generation_config=generation_config)

    if print_prompt:
        print("-------Prompt--------")
        print_multimodal_prompt(contents)

    if print_raw_response:
        print("\n-------Raw Response--------")
        print(response)

    return response.text
```

## Entity Extraction

[Named Entity Extraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition) is a technique of Natural Language Processing to identify specific fields and values from unstructured text. For example, you can find key-value pairs from a filled out form, or get all of the important data from an invoice categorized by the type.

### Extract entities from an invoice

In this example, you will use a sample invoice and get all of the information in JSON format.

This is the prompt to be sent to Gemini along with the PDF document. Feel free to edit this for your specific use case.


```
invoice_extraction_prompt = """You are a document entity extraction specialist. Given a document, your task is to extract the text value of the following entities:
{
	"amount_paid_since_last_invoice": "",
	"carrier": "",
	"currency": "",
	"currency_exchange_rate": "",
	"delivery_date": "",
	"due_date": "",
	"freight_amount": "",
	"invoice_date": "",
	"invoice_id": "",
	"line_items": [
		{
			"amount": "",
			"description": "",
			"product_code": "",
			"purchase_order": "",
			"quantity": "",
			"unit": "",
			"unit_price": ""
		}
	],
	"net_amount": "",
	"payment_terms": "",
	"purchase_order": "",
	"receiver_address": "",
	"receiver_email": "",
	"receiver_name": "",
	"receiver_phone": "",
	"receiver_tax_id": "",
	"receiver_website": "",
	"remit_to_address": "",
	"remit_to_name": "",
	"ship_from_address": "",
	"ship_from_name": "",
	"ship_to_address": "",
	"ship_to_name": "",
	"supplier_address": "",
	"supplier_email": "",
	"supplier_iban": "",
	"supplier_name": "",
	"supplier_payment_ref": "",
	"supplier_phone": "",
	"supplier_registration": "",
	"supplier_tax_id": "",
	"supplier_website": "",
	"total_amount": "",
	"total_tax_amount": "",
	"vat": [
		{
			"amount": "",
			"category_code": "",
			"tax_amount": "",
			"tax_rate": "",
			"total_amount": ""
		}
	]
}

- The JSON schema must be followed during the extraction.
- The values must only include text found in the document
- Do not normalize any entity value.
- If an entity is not found in the document, set the entity value to null.
"""
```


```
# Download a PDF from Google Cloud Storage
! gsutil cp "gs://cloud-samples-data/generative-ai/pdf/invoice.pdf" ./invoice.pdf
```


```
# Load file bytes
with open("invoice.pdf", "rb") as f:
    file_part = Part.from_data(data=f.read(), mime_type="application/pdf")

# Load contents
contents = [file_part, invoice_extraction_prompt]

# Send to Gemini with GenerationConfig
response = model.generate_content(contents, generation_config=generation_config)
```


```
print("-------Prompt--------")
print_multimodal_prompt(contents)

print("\n-------Raw Response--------")
print(response.text)
```

This response can then be parsed as JSON into a Python dictionary for use in other applications.


```
print("\n-------Parsed Entities--------")
json_object = json.loads(response.text)
print(json_object)
```

You can see that Gemini extracted all of the relevant fields from the document.

### Extract entities from a payslip

Let's try with another type of document, a payslip or paystub.


```
payslip_extraction_prompt = """You are a document entity extraction specialist. Given a document, your task is to extract the text value of the following entities:
{
"earning_item": [
{
"earning_rate": "",
"earning_hours": "",
"earning_type": "",
"earning_this_period": ""
}
],
"direct_deposit_item": [

"state_allowance": "",
"state_marital_status": "",
"tax_item": [
{
"tax_this_period": "",
"tax_type": "",
"tax_ytd": ""
}
]
}

- The JSON schema must be followed during the extraction.
- The values must only include text strings found in the document.
- Generate null for missing entities.
"""
```


```
response_text = process_document(
    payslip_extraction_prompt,
    "gs://cloud-samples-data/generative-ai/pdf/earnings_statement.pdf",
    generation_config=generation_config,
    print_prompt=True,
)
```


```
print("\n-------Parsed Entities--------")
json_object = json.loads(response_text)
print(json_object)
```

## Document Classification

Document classification is the process for identifying the type of document. For example, invoice, W-2, receipt, etc.

In this example, you will use a sample tax form (W-9) and get the specific type of document from a specified list.


```
classification_prompt = """You are a document classification assistant. Given a document, your task is to find which category the document belongs to from the list of document categories provided below.

 1040_2019
 1040_2020
 1099-r
 bank_statement
 credit_card_statement
 expense
 form_1120S_2019
 form_1120S_2020
 investment_retirement_statement
 invoice
 paystub
 property_insurance
 purchase_order
 utility_statement
 w2
 w9
 driver_license

Which category does the above document belong to? Answer with one of the predefined document categories only.
"""
```


```
response_text = process_document(
    classification_prompt,
    "gs://cloud-samples-data/generative-ai/pdf/w9.pdf",
    print_prompt=True,
)
```


```
print("\n-------Document Classification--------")
print(response_text)
```

You can see that Gemini successfully categorized the document.

### Chaining Classification and Extraction

These techniques can also be chained together to extract any number of document types. For example, if you have multiple types of documents to process, you can send each document to Gemini with a classification prompt, then based on that output, you can write logic to decide which extraction prompt to use.


```
generic_document_prompt = """You are a document entity extraction specialist. Given a document, your task is to extract the text value of the following entities:

{}

- The JSON schema must be followed during the extraction.
- The values must only include text found in the document
- Do not normalize any entity value.
- If an entity is not found in the document, set the entity value to null.

    print(f"Document Classification: {doc_classification}")

    # Get Extraction prompt based on Classification
    extraction_prompt = classification_to_prompt.get(doc_classification)

    if not extraction_prompt:
        print(f"Document does not belong to a specified class {doc_classification}")
        continue

    # Send to Gemini with Extraction Prompt
    extraction_response_text = process_document(
        extraction_prompt,
        gcs_uri,
        generation_config=generation_config,

    ).strip()

    print("\n-------Extracted Entities--------")
    json_object = json.loads(extraction_response_text)
    print(json_object)
```

## Document Question Answering

Gemini can be used to answer questions about a document.

This example answers a question about the Transformer model paper "Attention is all you need".


```
qa_prompt = """What is attention in the context of transformer models? Give me the answer first, followed by an explanation."""
```


```
# Send Q&A Prompt to Gemini
response_text = process_document(
    qa_prompt,
    "gs://cloud-samples-data/generative-ai/pdf/1706.03762v7.pdf",
)

print(f"Answer: {response_text}")
```

## Document Summarization

Gemini can also be used to summarize or paraphrase a document's contents. Your prompt can specify how detailed the summary should be or specific formatting, such as bullet points or paragraphs.


```
summarization_prompt = """You are a very professional document summarization specialist. Given a document, your task is to provide a detailed summary of the content of the document.

If it includes images, provide descriptions of the images.
If it includes tables, extract all elements of the tables.
If it includes graphs, explain the findings in the graphs.
Do not include any numbers that are not mentioned in the document.
"""
```


```
# Send Summarization Prompt to Gemini
response_text = process_document(
    summarization_prompt,
    "gs://cloud-samples-data/generative-ai/pdf/fdic_board_meeting.pdf",
)

print(f"Summarization: {response_text}")
```

## Table parsing from documents

Gemini can parse contents of a table and return it in a structured format, such as HTML or markdown.


```
table_extraction_prompt = """What is the html code of the table in this document?"""
```


```
# Send Table Extraction Prompt to Gemini
response_text = process_document(
    table_extraction_prompt,
    "gs://cloud-samples-data/generative-ai/pdf/salary_table.pdf",
)
display(Markdown(response_text))
```

## Document Translation

Gemini can translate documents between languages. This example translates meeting notes from English into French and Spanish.


```
translation_prompt = """Translate the first paragraph into French and Spanish. Label each paragraph with the target language."""
```


```
# Send Translation Prompt to Gemini
response_text = process_document(
    translation_prompt,
    "gs://cloud-samples-data/generative-ai/pdf/fdic_board_meeting.pdf",
)

print(response_text)
```

## Document Comparison

Gemini can compare and contrast the contents of multiple documents. This example finds the changes in the IRS Form 1040 between 2013 and 2023.

Note: when working with multiple documents, the order can matter and should be specified in your prompt.


```
comparison_prompt = """The first document is from 2013, the second one from 2023. How did the standard deduction evolve?"""
```


```
# Send Comparison Prompt to Gemini
file_part1 = Part.from_uri(
    uri="gs://cloud-samples-data/generative-ai/pdf/form_1040_2013.pdf",
    mime_type=PDF_MIME_TYPE,
)

file_part2 = Part.from_uri(
    uri="gs://cloud-samples-data/generative-ai/pdf/form_1040_2023.pdf",
    mime_type=PDF_MIME_TYPE,
)

# Load contents
contents = [file_part1, file_part2, comparison_prompt]

# Send to Gemini
response = model.generate_content(contents)

print("-------Prompt--------")
print_multimodal_prompt(contents)

print("-------Output--------")
print(response.text)
```

## Overview

Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) has become a popular paradigm for enabling LLMs to access external data and also as a mechanism for grounding to mitigate against hallucinations.

In this notebook, you will learn how to perform RAG where you will perform Q&A over a document filled with both text and images.

### Gemini

Gemini is a family of generative AI models developed by Google DeepMind that is designed for multimodal use cases. The Gemini API gives you access to the Gemini 1.5 Pro model.

### Comparing text-based and multimodal RAG

Multimodal RAG offers several advantages over text-based RAG:

1. **Enhanced knowledge access:** Multimodal RAG can access and process both textual and visual information, providing a richer and more comprehensive knowledge base for the LLM.
2. **Improved reasoning capabilities:** By incorporating visual cues, multimodal RAG can make better informed inferences across different types of data modalities.

This notebook shows you how to use multimodal RAG with Gemini API in Vertex AI, [text embeddings](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/model-reference/text-embeddings) to build a question answering system for a PDF document.


### Costs

This tutorial uses billable components of Google Cloud:

- Vertex AI

Learn about [Vertex AI pricing](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/pricing) and use the [Pricing Calculator](https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator/) to generate a cost estimate based on your projected usage.

### Objectives

This notebook provides a guide to building a questions answering system using multimodal retrieval augmented generation (RAG).

You will complete the following tasks:

1. Extract data from documents containing both text and images using Gemini Vision Pro, and generate embeddings of the data, store it in vector store
2. Search the vector store with text queries to find similar text data
3. Using Text data as context, generate answer to the user query using Gemini Pro Model.

## Getting Started

### Install Vertex AI SDK and other required packages



```
%pip install --upgrade --quiet pymupdf langchain gradio google-cloud-aiplatform langchain_google_vertexai
```

### Restart runtime

To use the newly installed packages in this Jupyter runtime, you must restart the runtime. You can do this by running the cell below, which restarts the current kernel.

The restart might take a minute or longer. After its restarted, continue to the next step.


```
import IPython

app = IPython.Application.instance()
app.kernel.do_shutdown(True)
```

<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning">
<b>⚠️ Wait for the kernel to finish restarting before you continue. ⚠️</b>
</div>

### Authenticate your notebook environment (Colab only)

If you are running this notebook on Google Colab, run the cell below to authenticate your environment.

This step is not required if you are using [Vertex AI Workbench](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai-workbench).


```
import sys

# Additional authentication is required for Google Colab
if "google.colab" in sys.modules:
    # Authenticate user to Google Cloud
    from google.colab import auth

    auth.authenticate_user()
```

### Define Google Cloud project information and initialize Vertex AI

To get started using Vertex AI, you must have an existing Google Cloud project and [enable the Vertex AI API](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=aiplatform.googleapis.com).

Learn more about [setting up a project and a development environment](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/start/cloud-environment).


```
# Define project information
PROJECT_ID = "[your-project-id]"  # @param {type:"string"}
LOCATION = "us-central1"  # @param {type:"string"}

# Initialize Vertex AI
import vertexai

vertexai.init(project=PROJECT_ID, location=LOCATION)
```

### Split PDF to images and extract data using Gemini Vision Pro
This module processes a set of images, extracting text and tabular data using a multimodal model (Gemini 1.5 Pro).
It handles potential errors, stores the extracted information in a DataFrame, and saves the results to a CSV file.


```
# Run the following code for each file
PDF_FILENAME = "04a02.pdf"  # Replace with your filename
```


```
# To get better resolution
zoom_x = 2.0  # horizontal zoom
zoom_y = 2.0  # vertical zoom
mat = fitz.Matrix(zoom_x, zoom_y)  # zoom factor 2 in each dimension

doc = fitz.open(PDF_FILENAME)  # open document
for page in doc:  # iterate through the pages
    pix = page.get_pixmap(matrix=mat)  # render page to an image
    outpath = f"./Images/{PDF_FILENAME}_{page.number}.jpg"
    pix.save(outpath)  # store image as a PNG

# Define the path where images are located
image_names = os.listdir(Image_Path)
Max_images = len(image_names)

# Create empty lists to store image information
page_source = []
page_content = []
page_id = []

p_id = 0  # Initialize image ID counter
rest_count = 0  # Initialize counter for error handling

while p_id < Max_images:
    try:
        # Construct the full path to the current image
        image_path = Image_Path + image_names[p_id]

        # Load the image
        image = Image.load_from_file(image_path)

        # Generate prompts for text and table extraction
        prompt_text = "Extract all text content in the image"
        prompt_table = (
            "Detect table in this image. Extract content maintaining the structure"
        )

        # Extract text using your multimodal model
        contents = [image, prompt_text]
        response = multimodal_model.generate_content(contents)
        text_content = response.text

        # Extract table using your multimodal model
        contents = [image, prompt_table]
        response = multimodal_model.generate_content(contents)
        table_content = response.text

        # Log progress and store results
        print(f"processed image no: {p_id}")
        page_source.append(image_path)
        page_content.append(text_content + "\n" + table_content)
        page_id.append(p_id)
        p_id += 1

    except Exception as err:
        # Handle errors during processing
        print(err)
        print("Taking Some Rest")
        time.sleep(1)  # Pause execution for 1 second
        rest_count += 1
        if rest_count == 5:  # Limit consecutive error handling
            rest_count = 0
            print(f"Cannot process image no: {image_path}")
            p_id += 1  # Move to the next image

# Create a DataFrame to store extracted information
df = pd.DataFrame(
    {"page_id": page_id, "page_source": page_source, "page_content": page_content}
)
del page_id, page_source, page_content  # Conserve memory
df.head()  # Preview the DataFrame
```

# Generate Text Embeddings
Leverage a powerful language model textembedding-gecko to generate rich text embeddings that helps us find relevant information from a dataset.


```
def generate_text_embedding(text) -> list:
    """Text embedding with a Large Language Model."""
    embeddings = text_embedding_model.get_embeddings([text])
    vector = embeddings[0].values
    return vector


# Create a DataFrameLoader to prepare data for LangChain
loader = DataFrameLoader(df, page_content_column="page_content")

# Load documents from the 'page_content' column of your DataFrame
documents = loader.load()

# Log the number of documents loaded
print(f"# of documents loaded (pre-chunking) = {len(documents)}")

# Create a text splitter to divide documents into smaller chunks
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(
    chunk_size=10000,  # Target size of approximately 10000 characters per chunk
    chunk_overlap=200,  # overlap between chunks
)

# Split the loaded documents
doc_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)

# Add a 'chunk' ID to each document split's metadata for tracking
for idx, split in enumerate(doc_splits):
    split.metadata["chunk"] = idx

# Log the number of documents after splitting
print(f"# of documents = {len(doc_splits)}")

texts = [doc.page_content for doc in doc_splits]
text_embeddings_list = []
id_list = []
page_source_list = []
for doc in doc_splits:
    id = uuid.uuid4()
    text_embeddings_list.append(generate_text_embedding(doc.page_content))
    id_list.append(str(id))
    page_source_list.append(doc.metadata["page_source"])
    time.sleep(1)  # So that we don't run into Quota Issue

# Creating a dataframe of ID, embeddings, page_source and text
embedding_df = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "id": id_list,
        "embedding": text_embeddings_list,
        "page_source": page_source_list,
        "text": texts,
    }
)
embedding_df.head()
```

### Creating Vertex AI: Vector Search
The code configures and deploys a vector search index on Google Cloud, making it ready to store and search through embeddings.

Embedding size :  The number of values used to represent a piece of text in vector form. Larger dimensions mean a denser and potentially more expressive representation.


Dimensions vs. Latency

* Search: Higher-dimensional embeddings can make vector similarity searches slower, especially in large databases.
* Computation: Calculations with larger vectors generally take more time during model training and inference.



```
VECTOR_SEARCH_REGION = "us-central1"
VECTOR_SEARCH_INDEX_NAME = f"{PROJECT_ID}-vector-search-index-ht"
VECTOR_SEARCH_EMBEDDING_DIR = f"{PROJECT_ID}-vector-search-bucket-ht"
VECTOR_SEARCH_DIMENSIONS = 768
```

### Save the embeddings in a JSON file
To load the embeddings to Vector Search, we need to save them in JSON files with JSONL format. See more information in the docs at [Input data format and structure](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/matching-engine/match-eng-setup/format-structure#data-file-formats).

First, export the `id` and `embedding` columns from the DataFrame in JSONL format, and save it.

Then, create a new Cloud Storage bucket and copy the file to it.


```
# save id and embedding as a json file
jsonl_string = embedding_df[["id", "embedding"]].to_json(orient="records", lines=True)
with open("data.json", "w") as f:
    f.write(jsonl_string)

# show the first few lines of the json file
! head -n 3 data.json
```


```
# Generates a unique ID for session
UID = datetime.now().strftime("%m%d%H%M")

# Creates a GCS bucket
BUCKET_URI = f"gs://{VECTOR_SEARCH_EMBEDDING_DIR}-{UID}"
! gsutil mb -l $LOCATION -p {PROJECT_ID} {BUCKET_URI}
! gsutil cp data.json {BUCKET_URI}
```

### Create an Index

Now it's ready to load the embeddings to Vector Search. Its APIs are available under the [aiplatform](https://cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/aiplatform/latest/google.cloud.aiplatform) package of the SDK.

Create an [MatchingEngineIndex](https://cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/aiplatform/latest/google.cloud.aiplatform.MatchingEngineIndex) with its `create_tree_ah_index` function (Matching Engine is the previous name of Vector Search).


```
# create index
my_index = aiplatform.MatchingEngineIndex.create_tree_ah_index(
    display_name=f"{VECTOR_SEARCH_INDEX_NAME}",
    contents_delta_uri=BUCKET_URI,
    dimensions=768,
    approximate_neighbors_count=20,
    distance_measure_type="DOT_PRODUCT_DISTANCE",
)
```

By calling the `create_tree_ah_index` function, it starts building an Index. This will take under a few minutes if the dataset is small, otherwise about 50 minutes or more depending on the size of the dataset. You can check status of the index creation on [the Vector Search Console > INDEXES tab](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/matching-engine/indexes).


#### The parameters for creating index

- `contents_delta_uri`: The URI of Cloud Storage directory where you stored the embedding JSON files
- `dimensions`: Dimension size of each embedding. In this case, it is 768 as we are using the embeddings from the Text Embeddings API.
- `approximate_neighbors_count`: how many similar items we want to retrieve in typical cases
- `distance_measure_type`: what metrics to measure distance/similarity between embeddings. In this case it's `DOT_PRODUCT_DISTANCE`

See [the document](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/vector-search/create-manage-index) for more details on creating Index and the parameters.


### Create Index Endpoint and deploy the Index

To use the Index, you need to create an [Index Endpoint](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/vector-search/deploy-index-public). It works as a server instance accepting query requests for your Index.


```
# create IndexEndpoint
my_index_endpoint = aiplatform.MatchingEngineIndexEndpoint.create(
    display_name=f"{VECTOR_SEARCH_INDEX_NAME}",
    public_endpoint_enabled=True,
)
```

This tutorial utilizes a [Public Endpoint](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/vector-search/setup/setup#choose-endpoint) and does not support [Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/private-services-access). Unless you have a specific requirement for VPC, we recommend using a Public Endpoint. Despite the term "public" in its name, it does not imply open access to the public internet. Rather, it functions like other endpoints in Vertex AI services, which are secured by default through IAM. Without explicit IAM permissions, as we have previously established, no one can access the endpoint.

With the Index Endpoint, deploy the Index by specifying an unique deployed index ID.


```
DEPLOYED_INDEX_NAME = VECTOR_SEARCH_INDEX_NAME.replace(
    "-", "_"
)  # Can't have - in deployment name, only alphanumeric and _ allowed
DEPLOYED_INDEX_ID = f"{DEPLOYED_INDEX_NAME}_{UID}"
# deploy the Index to the Index Endpoint
my_index_endpoint.deploy_index(index=my_index, deployed_index_id=DEPLOYED_INDEX_ID)
```

If it is the first time to deploy an Index to an Index Endpoint, it will take around 25 minutes to automatically build and initiate the backend for it. After the first deployment, it will finish in seconds. To see the status of the index deployment, open [the Vector Search Console > INDEX ENDPOINTS tab](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/matching-engine/index-endpoints) and click the Index Endpoint.

### Ask Questions to the PDF
This code snippet establishes a question-answering (QA) system.  It leverages a vector search engine to find relevant information from a dataset and then uses the 'gemini-1.5-pro' LLM model to generate and refine the final answer to a user's query.


```
def Test_LLM_Response(txt):
    """
    Determines whether a given text response generated by an LLM indicates a lack of information.

    Args:
        txt (str): The text response generated by the LLM.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the LLM's response suggests it was able to generate a meaningful answer,
              False if the response indicates it could not find relevant information.

    This function works by presenting a formatted classification prompt to the LLM (`gemini_1.5-pro`).
    The prompt includes the original text and specific categories indicating whether sufficient information was available.
    The function analyzes the LLM's classification output to make the determination.
    """

    classification_prompt = f""" Classify the text as one of the following categories:

    classification_response = multimodal_model.generate_content(
        classification_prompt
    ).text

    if "Not Present" in classification_response:
        return False  # Indicates that the LLM couldn't provide an answer
    else:
        return True  # Suggests the LLM generated a meaningful response


def get_prompt_text(question, context):
    """
    Generates a formatted prompt string suitable for a language model, combining the provided question and context.

    Args:
        question (str): The user's original question.
        context (str): The relevant text to be used as context for the answer.

    Returns:
        str: A formatted prompt string with placeholders for the question and context, designed to guide the language model's answer generation.
    """
    prompt = """

## Filtering sitemap URLs

Sitemaps can contain thousands of URLs and ften you don't need every single one of them. You can filter the URLs by passing a list of strings or regex patterns to the `url_filter` parameter.  Only URLs that match one of the patterns will be loaded.


```python
loader = DocusaurusLoader(
    "https://python.langchain.com",
    filter_urls=[
        "https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/document_loaders/sitemap"

LangChain#\\nLarge language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling\\ndevelopers to build applications that they previously could not.\\nBut using these LLMs in isolation is often not enough to\\ncreate a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you are able to\\ncombine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.\\nThis library is aimed at assisting in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these types of applications include:\\n❓ Question Answering over specific documents\\n\\nDocumentation\\nEnd-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database\\n\\n💬 Chatbots\\n\\nDocumentation\\nEnd-to-end Example: Chat-LangChain\\n\\n🤖 Agents\\n\\nDocumentation\\nEnd-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha\\n\\n\\nGetting Started#\\nCheckout the below guide for a walkthrough of how to get started using LangChain to create an Language Model application.\\n\\nGetting Started Documentation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nModules#\\nThere are several main modules that LangChain provides support for.\\nFor each module we provide some examples to get started, how-to guides, reference docs, and conceptual guides.\\nThese modules are, in increasing order of complexity:\\n\\nPrompts: This includes prompt management, prompt optimization, and prompt serialization.\\nLLMs: This includes a generic interface for all LLMs, and common utilities for working with LLMs.\\nDocument Loaders: This includes a standard interface for loading documents, as well as specific integrations to all types of text data sources.\\nUtils: Language models are often more powerful when interacting with other sources of knowledge or computation. This can include Python REPLs, embeddings, search engines, and more. LangChain provides a large collection of common utils to use in your application.\\nChains: Chains go beyond just a single LLM call, and are sequences of calls (whether to an LLM or a different utility). LangChain provides a standard interface for chains, lots of integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications.\\nIndexes: Language models are often more powerful when combined with your own text data - this module covers best practices for doing exactly that.\\nAgents: Agents involve an LLM making decisions about which Actions to take, taking that Action, seeing an Observation, and repeating that until done. LangChain provides a standard interface for agents, a selection of agents to choose from, and examples of end to end agents.\\nMemory: Memory is the concept of persisting state between calls of a chain/agent. LangChain provides a standard interface for memory, a collection of memory implementations, and examples of chains/agents that use memory.\\nChat: Chat models are a variation on Language Models that expose a different API - rather than working with raw text, they work with messages. LangChain provides a standard interface for working with them and doing all the same things as above.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUse Cases#\\nThe above modules can be used in a variety of ways. LangChain also provides guidance and assistance in this. Below are some of the common use cases LangChain supports.\\n\\nAgents: Agents are systems that use a language model to interact with other tools. These can be used to do more grounded question/answering, interact with APIs, or even take actions.\\nChatbots: Since language models are good at producing text, that makes them ideal for creating chatbots.\\nData Augmented Generation: Data Augmented Generation involves specific types of chains that first interact with an external datasource to fetch data to use in the generation step. Examples of this include summarization of long pieces of text and question/answering over specific data sources.\\nQuestion Answering: Answering questions over specific documents, only utilizing the information in those documents to construct an answer. A type of Data Augmented Generation.\\nSummarization: Summarizing longer documents into shorter, more condensed chunks of information. A type of Data Augmented Generation.\\nQuerying Tabular Data: If you want to understand how to use LLMs to query data that is stored in a tabular format (csvs, SQL, dataframes, etc) you should read this page.\\nEvaluation: Generative models are notoriously hard to evaluate with traditional metrics. One new way of evaluating them is using language models themselves to do the evaluation. LangChain provides some prompts/chains for assisting in this.\\nGenerate similar examples: Generating similar examples to a given input. This is a common use case for many applications, and LangChain provides some prompts/chains for assisting in this.\\nCompare models: Experimenting with different prompts, models, and chains is a big part of developing the best possible application. The ModelLaboratory makes it easy to do so.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReference Docs#\\nAll of LangChain’s reference documentation, in one place. Full documentation on all methods, classes, installation methods, and integration setups for LangChain.\\n\\nReference Documentation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLangChain Ecosystem#\\nGuides for how other companies/products can be used with LangChain\\n\\nLangChain Ecosystem\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdditional Resources#\\nAdditional collection of resources we think may be useful as you develop your application!\\n\\nLangChainHub: The LangChainHub is a place to share and explore other prompts, chains, and agents.\\nGlossary: A glossary of all related terms, papers, methods, etc. Whether implemented in LangChain or not!\\nGallery: A collection of our favorite projects that use LangChain. Useful for finding inspiration or seeing how things were done in other applications.\\nDeployments: A collection of instructions, code snippets, and template repositories for deploying LangChain apps.\\nDiscord: Join us on our Discord to discuss all things LangChain!\\nTracing: A guide on using tracing in LangChain to visualize the execution of chains and agents.\\nProduction Support: As you move your LangChains into production, we’d love to offer more comprehensive support. Please fill out this form and we’ll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nnext\\nQuickstart Guide\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Contents\\n  \\n\\n\\nGetting Started\\nModules\\nUse Cases\\nReference Docs\\nLangChain Ecosystem\\nAdditional Resources\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Harrison Chase\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n      © Copyright 2023, Harrison Chase.\\n      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Last updated on Mar 24, 2023.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\', lookup_str=\'\', metadata={\'source\': \'https://python.langchain.com/en/stable/\', \'loc\': \'https://python.langchain.com/en/stable/\', \'lastmod\': \'2023-03-24T19:30:54.647430+00:00\', \'changefreq\': \'weekly\', \'priority\': \'1\'}, lookup_index=0)Filtering sitemap URLs\u200bSitemaps can be massive files, with thousands of URLs.

We believe that the most powerful and differentiated applications will not only call out to a language model via an API, but will also:\\n\\nBe data-aware: connect a language model to other sources of data\\nBe agentic: allow a language model to interact with its environment\\n\\nThe LangChain framework is designed with the above principles in mind.\\nThis is the Python specific portion of the documentation. For a purely conceptual guide to LangChain, see here. For the JavaScript documentation, see here.\\n\\nGetting Started#\\nCheckout the below guide for a walkthrough of how to get started using LangChain to create an Language Model application.\\n\\nGetting Started Documentation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nModules#\\nThere are several main modules that LangChain provides support for.\\nFor each module we provide some examples to get started, how-to guides, reference docs, and conceptual guides.\\nThese modules are, in increasing order of complexity:\\n\\nModels: The various model types and model integrations LangChain supports.\\nPrompts: This includes prompt management, prompt optimization, and prompt serialization.\\nMemory: Memory is the concept of persisting state between calls of a chain/agent. LangChain provides a standard interface for memory, a collection of memory implementations, and examples of chains/agents that use memory.\\nIndexes: Language models are often more powerful when combined with your own text data - this module covers best practices for doing exactly that.\\nChains: Chains go beyond just a single LLM call, and are sequences of calls (whether to an LLM or a different utility). LangChain provides a standard interface for chains, lots of integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications.\\nAgents: Agents involve an LLM making decisions about which Actions to take, taking that Action, seeing an Observation, and repeating that until done. LangChain provides a standard interface for agents, a selection of agents to choose from, and examples of end to end agents.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUse Cases#\\nThe above modules can be used in a variety of ways. LangChain also provides guidance and assistance in this. Below are some of the common use cases LangChain supports.\\n\\nPersonal Assistants: The main LangChain use case. Personal assistants need to take actions, remember interactions, and have knowledge about your data.\\nQuestion Answering: The second big LangChain use case. Answering questions over specific documents, only utilizing the information in those documents to construct an answer.\\nChatbots: Since language models are good at producing text, that makes them ideal for creating chatbots.\\nQuerying Tabular Data: If you want to understand how to use LLMs to query data that is stored in a tabular format (csvs, SQL, dataframes, etc) you should read this page.\\nInteracting with APIs: Enabling LLMs to interact with APIs is extremely powerful in order to give them more up-to-date information and allow them to take actions.\\nExtraction: Extract structured information from text.\\nSummarization: Summarizing longer documents into shorter, more condensed chunks of information. A type of Data Augmented Generation.\\nEvaluation: Generative models are notoriously hard to evaluate with traditional metrics. One new way of evaluating them is using language models themselves to do the evaluation. LangChain provides some prompts/chains for assisting in this.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReference Docs#\\nAll of LangChain’s reference documentation, in one place. Full documentation on all methods, classes, installation methods, and integration setups for LangChain.\\n\\nReference Documentation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLangChain Ecosystem#\\nGuides for how other companies/products can be used with LangChain\\n\\nLangChain Ecosystem\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdditional Resources#\\nAdditional collection of resources we think may be useful as you develop your application!\\n\\nLangChainHub: The LangChainHub is a place to share and explore other prompts, chains, and agents.\\nGlossary: A glossary of all related terms, papers, methods, etc. Whether implemented in LangChain or not!\\nGallery: A collection of our favorite projects that use LangChain.

The SitemapLoader constructor accepts a custom scraping function. This feature can be helpful to tailor the scraping process to your specific needs; for example, you might want to avoid scraping headers or navigation elements. The following example shows how to develop and use a custom function to avoid navigation and header elements.Import the beautifulsoup4 library and define the custom function.pip install beautifulsoup4from bs4 import BeautifulSoupdef remove_nav_and_header_elements(content: BeautifulSoup) -> str:    # Find all \'nav\' and \'header\' elements in the BeautifulSoup object    nav_elements = content.find_all("nav")    header_elements = content.find_all("header")    # Remove each \'nav\' and \'header\' element from the BeautifulSoup object    for element in nav_elements + header_elements:        element.decompose()    return str(content.get_text())Add your custom function to the SitemapLoader object.loader = SitemapLoader(    "https://langchain.readthedocs.io/sitemap.xml",    filter_urls=["https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/"],    parsing_function=remove_nav_and_header_elements,)Local Sitemap\u200bThe sitemap loader can also be used to load local files.sitemap_loader = SitemapLoader(web_path="example_data/sitemap.xml", is_local=True)docs = sitemap_loader.load()    Fetching pages: 100%|####################################################################################################################################| 3/3 [00:00<00:00,  3.91it/s]PreviousRSTNextSlackFiltering sitemap URLsAdd custom scraping rulesLocal SitemapCommunityDiscordTwitterGitHubPythonJS/TSMoreHomepageBlogCopyright © 2023 LangChain, Inc.\n\n\n\n', metadata={'source': 'https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/document_loaders/sitemap', 'loc': 'https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/document_loaders/sitemap', 'changefreq': 'weekly', 'priority': '0.5'})



## Add custom scraping rules

By default, the parser **removes** all but the main content of the docusaurus page, which is normally the `<article>` tag. You also have the option  to define an **inclusive** list HTML tags by providing them as a list utilizing the `custom_html_tags` parameter. For example:


```python
loader = DocusaurusLoader(
    "https://python.langchain.com",
    filter_urls=[
        "https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/document_loaders/sitemap"
    ],
    # This will only include the content that matches these tags, otherwise they will be removed
    custom_html_tags=["#content", ".main"],
)
```

You can also define an entirely custom parsing function if you need finer-grained control over the returned content for each page.

The following example shows how to develop and use a custom function to avoid navigation and header elements.


```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup


def remove_nav_and_header_elements(content: BeautifulSoup) -> str:
    # Find all 'nav' and 'header' elements in the BeautifulSoup object
    nav_elements = content.find_all("nav")
    header_elements = content.find_all("header")

    # Remove each 'nav' and 'header' element from the BeautifulSoup object
    for element in nav_elements + header_elements:
        element.decompose()

    return str(content.get_text())
```

Add your custom function to the `DocusaurusLoader` object.


```python
loader = DocusaurusLoader(
    "https://python.langchain.com",
    filter_urls=[
        "https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/document_loaders/sitemap"
    ],
    parsing_function=remove_nav_and_header_elements,
)
```

## Overview
There are many ways to customize RAG pipelines by choosing how to ingest, parse, chunk, and retrieve your data. This notebook focuses on comparing different document parsing capabilities offered by LlamaIndex.

We will compare document parsing with LlamaIndex and LlamaParse on a 10-Q financial document, which is heavily populated with complex tables.

### Objectives
This notebook compare using LlamaIndex and LlamaParse for ingesting and indexing a complex document. 

You will complete the following tasks:
1. Ingest and parse document using LlamaIndex SimpleDataReader, LlamaIndex LangchainNodeParser, and LlamaParse Parser using Gemini models.
2. Index your parsed document in a VectorStore.
3. Create a a query agent for each parsing technique that can answer questions against the input document.
4. Compare results across LlamaIndex and LlamaParse.

### LlamaIndex
LlamaIndex is a foundational data framework for building LLM applications. A few of its main capabilities are:

+ Data Ingestion: Loads your data from various sources (documents, databases, APIs).   
+ Indexing: Structures your data into efficient formats for LLM retrieval (e.g., vector stores, tree structures).   
+ Querying: Enables you to ask questions or give instructions to the LLM, referencing your indexed data for answers.   
+ Integration: Connects with various LLMs, vector databases, and other tools.   
  

### LlamaParse
LlamaParse is a tool within the LlamaIndex ecosystem, focused on parsing complex documents:

+ PDFs: Handles PDFs with tables, charts, and other embedded elements that can be challenging for standard parsing.  
+ Semi-structured Data: Extracts structured information from documents that aren't fully formatted databases.   
+ Enhanced Retrieval: Works seamlessly with LlamaIndex to improve retrieval accuracy for complex documents.

    auth.authenticate_user()
```

### Download sample data

For the remainder of the notebook we will examine Alphabet Inc. 10Q document. A 10Q is a financial document that is dense with tables with financial figures. This document is a great candidate to to investigate document parsing capabilities.


```
!mkdir {DATA_FOLDER}
!wget "https://abc.xyz/assets/ae/e9/753110054014b6de4d620a2853f6/goog-10-q-q2-2024.pdf" -P {DATA_FOLDER}
```

##  Document Parsing with LlamaIndex

This section will ingest and parse the 10Q using LlamaIndex tools, specifically focusing on SimpleDirectoryReader and LangChainNodeParser.

### Option 1: `SimpleDirectoryReader`
The SimpleDirectoryReader is the core data ingestion tool in LlamaIndex. It's designed to load data from a variety of sources and convert it into a format suitable for further processing and indexing by LlamaIndex.


```
reader = SimpleDirectoryReader("./data")
documents = reader.load_data(show_progress=True)
print(documents[0])
```


```
# Index the parsed document
simpledirectory_index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents)

# Generate a query engine based on the SimpleDataReader
simple_query_engine = simpledirectory_index.as_query_engine(similarity_top_k=2)
```

### Option 2: `LangChainNodeParser` with LlamaIndex
The LangChainNodeParser is a part of LlamaIndex. It is a specialized parser designed to extract structured information from text documents using the power of LangChain.

Key Features:
+ LangChain Integration: Leverages LangChain's powerful language models and tools to parse text.
+ Node-Based Output: Converts unstructured text into a structured format based on a defined schema, represented as a hierarchy of nodes. This enables more sophisticated querying and analysis of the extracted information.
+ Customization: Supports defining custom parsing schemas to match the structure of your specific documents.
+ Flexibility: Can be used in combination with other LlamaIndex components, such as the SimpleDataReader, to process and index the extracted structured data.


```
parser = LangchainNodeParser(RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter())
langchain_nodes = parser.get_nodes_from_documents(documents)
```


```
# An example node that was generated using the LangChainNodeParser and the associated metadata
langchain_nodes[0]
```


```
# Index the document based on the LangChain nodes generated above
langchainparser_index = VectorStoreIndex(nodes=langchain_nodes)

# Create a query engine based off the LangChainNodeParser
lg_query_engine = langchainparser_index.as_query_engine(similarity_top_k=2)
```

## LlamaParse

LlamaParse Parser is a powerful tool for extracting structured data from unstructured or semi-structured text, offering flexibility, customization, and seamless integration within the LlamaIndex framework.It can take an unstructured or semi-structured text document and, using a defined schema, extract structured information from it. This structured output is represented as a nested hierarchy of nodes, facilitating further processing and analysis.

A few key features include:

+ JSON Schema: Leverages the standardized JSON Schema format for more complex schemas.
+ Prompt Templates: Allows you to craft custom prompts to guide the language model's parsing behavior, offering greater control and adaptability.
+ LLM Selection: You have the flexibility to choose the specific LLM you want to use for parsing, enabling you to tailor the performance to your specific needs and budget.
+ Node-Based Output:
    + Structured Representation: The parsed output is organized into a hierarchy of nodes, each representing a piece of extracted information.
    + Nested Structure: Nodes can contain other nodes, allowing for the representation of complex relationships and nested data structures within the document.
    + Metadata: Nodes can also include additional metadata, such as confidence scores or source information, enriching the extracted data.
+ Integration with LlamaIndex: The structured output from parser() seamlessly integrates with other LlamaIndex components, such as indexing and querying, facilitating efficient retrieval and analysis of the extracted information.

#### Define a Parser

Here we will define a LlamaParse() parser with specific parsing instructions, and ingest the data.


```
parser = LlamaParse(
    parsing_instruction="You are a financial analyst working specifically with 10Q documents. Not all pages have titles. Try to reconstruct the dialogue spoken in a cohesive way.",
    api_key="",
    result_type="text",  # "markdown" and "text" are available
    language="en",
    invalidate_cache=True,
)
```

### Option 1 - LlamaParse with SimpleDirectoryReader

This is the apples to apples comparison with LlamaIndex. We are using the SimpleDirectoryReader with the LlamaParse file extractor, and then loading the data directly from documents to a Vector Store for retrieval.


```
import nest_asyncio

nest_asyncio.apply()
file_extractor = {".pdf": parser}
documents = SimpleDirectoryReader(
    input_files=["./data/goog-10-q-q2-2024.pdf"], file_extractor=file_extractor  # type: ignore
).load_data()
```


```
lp_simple = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents)
lp_simple_engine = lp_simple.as_query_engine(similarity_top_k=2)
```

### Option 2 - LlamaParse and Vertex AI Vector Search

This approach is a more customized approach by defining the Vector Search mechanism through Vertex AI and extracting metadata that will be embedded and stored in the search index. 

Using metadata in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) improves accuracy and context by focusing searches and providing additional information. This leads to efficient filtering, ranking, and personalized responses tailored to user needs and history. Metadata also facilitates handling complex multi-criteria queries, making RAG systems more versatile and effective.

The following section will:
+ Parse the documents using LlamaParse
+ Extract metadata from documents returned from LlamaParse
+ Create metadata embeddings attached to each document
+ Create index in Vertex AI Vector Store
+ Query against the Vector Store

#### Parse data using LlamaParse


```
documents = parser.load_data("./data/goog-10-q-q2-2024.pdf")
```

#### Create Metadata from Nodes

Using extractors we will generate meta-data for each node. The metadata is generated using Gemini-Pro and focuses on what questions can this text answer and what key words are meaningful in this section. Each metadata piece will be embedded with Gemini text-embedding model. 

Creating metadata can be useful for another lookup criteria during RAG based search.


```
extractors = [
    QuestionsAnsweredExtractor(questions=3, llm=llm),
    KeywordExtractor(keywords=10, llm=llm),
]
```


```
# Run metadata transformation pipeline.
pipeline = IngestionPipeline(
    transformations=extractors,  # type: ignore
)
nodes = await pipeline.arun(documents=documents, in_place=False)
```

Example metadata that was generated:


```
print(nodes[1].metadata)
```


```
# Generate embeddings for each metadata node
for node in nodes:
    node_embedding = embedding_model.get_text_embedding(
        node.get_content(metadata_mode="all")
    )
    node.embedding = node_embedding
```

#### Load Nodes into Predefined Vector Store

This following section required a preexisting Vertex AI Vector Store. Vector stores contain embedding vectors of ingested document chunks.

For information to create a vector store, refer to this link https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/vector_stores/VertexAIVectorSearchDemo/


```
vector_store = VertexAIVectorStore(
    project_id=PROJECT_ID,
    region=REGION,
    index_id="",  # Add in your Vertex AI Vector Search Index ID
    endpoint_id="",  # Add in your Vertex AI Vector Search Deployed Index ID
    gcs_bucket_name=GCS_BUCKET,
)

# Only need to run once
vector_store.add(nodes)
```

#### Create a search index and search and query the Vector Store


```
lp_index = VectorStoreIndex.from_vector_store(vector_store)
lp_query_engine = lp_index.as_query_engine(similarity_top_k=2)
```

## Query Comparison between LlamaIndex and LlamaParse
Below are queries that responses can be found in the 10Q document within complex tables. Let's see how each approach compares.


```
queries = [
    "What are the total cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of Dec 23 2023",
    "Total investments with fair value change reflected in other comprehensive income as of Dec 23 2023",
    "What is the corporate debt securities unrealized loss as of Dec 31 2023 for 12 months or greater?",
    "What is the coupon rate for total outstanding debt",
    "Provide the table of share repurchases",
]
```


```
def print_output(response: Response):
    print("Response:")
    print("-" * 80)
    print(colored(response.response, color="red"))
    print("-" * 80)
    print("Source Documents:")
    print("-" * 80)
    for source in response.source_nodes:
        print(f"Sample Text: {source.text[:100]}")
        print(f"Relevance score: {source.get_score():.3f}")
        print(f"File Name: {source.metadata.get('file_name')}")
        print(f"Page #: {source.metadata.get('page_label')}")
        print(f"File Path: {source.metadata.get('file_path')}")
        print("-" * 80)


def run_query(query_idx: int):
    query = queries[query_idx]
    print("Query: " + query)
    print(colored("LlamaIndex SimpleDirectoryReader response....\n", color="blue"))
    print_output(simple_query_engine.query(query))

# Dria

>[Dria](https://dria.co/) is a hub of public RAG models for developers to both contribute and utilize a shared embedding lake. This notebook demonstrates how to use the `Dria API` for data retrieval tasks.

# Installation

Ensure you have the `dria` package installed. You can install it using pip:


```python
%pip install --upgrade --quiet dria
```

# Configure API Key

Set up your Dria API key for access.


```python
import os

os.environ["DRIA_API_KEY"] = "DRIA_API_KEY"
```

# Initialize Dria Retriever

Create an instance of `DriaRetriever`.


```python
from langchain_community.retrievers import DriaRetriever

api_key = os.getenv("DRIA_API_KEY")
retriever = DriaRetriever(api_key=api_key)
```

# **Create Knowledge Base**

Create a knowledge on [Dria's Knowledge Hub](https://dria.co/knowledge)


```python
contract_id = retriever.create_knowledge_base(
    name="France's AI Development",
    embedding=DriaRetriever.models.jina_embeddings_v2_base_en.value,
    category="Artificial Intelligence",
    description="Explore the growth and contributions of France in the field of Artificial Intelligence.",
)
```

# Add Data

Load data into your Dria knowledge base.


```python
texts = [
    "The first text to add to Dria.",
    "Another piece of information to store.",
    "More data to include in the Dria knowledge base.",
]

ids = retriever.add_texts(texts)
print("Data added with IDs:", ids)
```

# Retrieve Data

Use the retriever to find relevant documents given a query.


```python
query = "Find information about Dria."
result = retriever.invoke(query)
for doc in result:
    print(doc)
```

# Dropbox

[Dropbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dropbox) is a file hosting service that brings everything-traditional files, cloud content, and web shortcuts together in one place.

This notebook covers how to load documents from *Dropbox*. In addition to common files such as text and PDF files, it also supports *Dropbox Paper* files.

## Prerequisites

1. Create a Dropbox app.
2. Give the app these scope permissions: `files.metadata.read` and `files.content.read`.
3. Generate access token: https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps/create.
4. `pip install dropbox` (requires `pip install "unstructured[pdf]"` for PDF filetype).

## Instructions

`DropboxLoader`` requires you to create a Dropbox App and generate an access token. This can be done from https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps/create. You also need to have the Dropbox Python SDK installed (pip install dropbox).

DropboxLoader can load data from a list of Dropbox file paths or a single Dropbox folder path. Both paths should be relative to the root directory of the Dropbox account linked to the access token.


```python
pip install dropbox
```

# DSPy

>[DSPy](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy) is a fantastic framework for LLMs that introduces an automatic compiler that teaches LMs how to conduct the declarative steps in your program. Specifically, the DSPy compiler will internally trace your program and then craft high-quality prompts for large LMs (or train automatic finetunes for small LMs) to teach them the steps of your task.

Thanks to [Omar Khattab](https://twitter.com/lateinteraction) we have an integration! It works with any LCEL chains with some minor modifications.

This short tutorial demonstrates how this proof-of-concept feature works. *This will not give you the full power of DSPy or LangChain yet, but we will expand it if there's high demand.*

Note: this was slightly modified from the original example Omar wrote for DSPy. If you are interested in LangChain \<\> DSPy but coming from the DSPy side, I'd recommend checking that out. You can find that [here](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy/blob/main/examples/tweets/compiling_langchain.ipynb).

Let's take a look at an example. In this example we will make a simple RAG pipeline. We will use DSPy to "compile" our program and learn an optimized prompt.

This example uses the `ColBERTv2` model.
See the [ColBERTv2: Effective and Efficient Retrieval via Lightweight Late Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01488) paper.


## Install dependencies

!pip install -U dspy-ai 
!pip install -U openai jinja2
!pip install -U langchain langchain-community langchain-openai langchain-core

## Setup

We will be using OpenAI, so we should set an API key


```python
import getpass
import os

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass()
```

We can now set up our retriever. For our retriever we will use a ColBERT retriever through DSPy, though this will work with any retriever.


```python
import dspy

colbertv2 = dspy.ColBERTv2(url="http://20.102.90.50:2017/wiki17_abstracts")
```


```python
from langchain.globals import set_llm_cache
from langchain_community.cache import SQLiteCache
from langchain_openai import OpenAI

set_llm_cache(SQLiteCache(database_path="cache.db"))

llm = OpenAI(model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct", temperature=0)


def retrieve(inputs):
    return [doc["text"] for doc in colbertv2(inputs["question"], k=5)]
```


```python
colbertv2("cycling")
```

## Normal LCEL

First, let's create a simple RAG pipeline with LCEL like we would normally.

For illustration, let's tackle the following task.

**Task:** Build a RAG system for generating informative tweets.

- **Input:** A factual question, which may be fairly complex.
 
- **Output:** An engaging tweet that correctly answers the question from the retrieved info.
 
Let's use LangChain's expression language (LCEL) to illustrate this. Any prompt here will do, we will optimize the final prompt with DSPy.

Considering that, let's just keep it to the barebones: **Given \{context\}, answer the question \{question\} as a tweet.**


```python
# From LangChain, import standard modules for prompting.
from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser
from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnablePassthrough

# Just a simple prompt for this task. It's fine if it's complex too.
prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(
    "Given {context}, answer the question `{question}` as a tweet."
)

# This is how you'd normally build a chain with LCEL. This chain does retrieval then generation (RAG).
vanilla_chain = (
    RunnablePassthrough.assign(context=retrieve) | prompt | llm | StrOutputParser()
)
```

## LCEL \<\> DSPy

In order to use LangChain with DSPy, you need to make two minor modifications

**LangChainPredict**

You need to change from doing `prompt | llm` to using `LangChainPredict(prompt, llm)` from `dspy`. 

This is a wrapper which will bind your prompt and llm together so you can optimize them

**LangChainModule**

This is a wrapper which wraps your final LCEL chain so that DSPy can optimize the whole thing


```python
# From DSPy, import the modules that know how to interact with LangChain LCEL.
from dspy.predict.langchain import LangChainModule, LangChainPredict

# This is how to wrap it so it behaves like a DSPy program.
# Just Replace every pattern like `prompt | llm` with `LangChainPredict(prompt, llm)`.
zeroshot_chain = (
    RunnablePassthrough.assign(context=retrieve)
    | LangChainPredict(prompt, llm)
    | StrOutputParser()
)
# Now we wrap it in LangChainModule
zeroshot_chain = LangChainModule(
    zeroshot_chain
)  # then wrap the chain in a DSPy module.
```

## Trying the Module

After this, we can use it as both a LangChain runnable and a DSPy module!


```python
question = "In what region was Eddy Mazzoleni born?"

zeroshot_chain.invoke({"question": question})
```




    ' Eddy Mazzoleni, born in Bergamo, Italy, is a professional road cyclist who rode for UCI ProTour Astana Team. #cyclist #Italy'



Ah that sounds about right! (It's technically not perfect: we asked for the region not the city. We can do better below.)

Inspecting questions and answers manually is very important to get a sense of your system. However, a good system designer always looks to iteratively benchmark their work to quantify progress!

To do this, we need two things: the metric we want to maximize and a (tiny) dataset of examples for our system.

Are there pre-defined metrics for good tweets? Should I label 100,000 tweets by hand? Probably not. We can easily do something reasonable, though, until you start getting data in production!

## Load Data

In order to compile our chain, we need a dataset to work with. This dataset just needs to be raw inputs and outputs. For our purposes, we will use HotPotQA dataset

Note: Notice that our dataset doesn't actually include any tweets! It only has questions and answers. That's OK, our metric will take care of evaluating outputs in tweet form.


```python
import dspy
from dspy.datasets import HotPotQA

# Load the dataset.
dataset = HotPotQA(
    train_seed=1,
    train_size=200,
    eval_seed=2023,
    dev_size=200,
    test_size=0,
    keep_details=True,
)

# Tell DSPy that the 'question' field is the input. Any other fields are labels and/or metadata.
trainset = [x.without("id", "type").with_inputs("question") for x in dataset.train]
devset = [x.without("id", "type").with_inputs("question") for x in dataset.dev]
valset, devset = devset[:50], devset[50:]
```

    /Users/harrisonchase/.pyenv/versions/3.11.1/envs/langchain-3-11/lib/python3.11/site-packages/datasets/table.py:1421: FutureWarning: promote has been superseded by mode='default'.
      table = cls._concat_blocks(blocks, axis=0)
    

## Define a metric

We now need to define a metric. This will be used to determine which runs were successful and we can learn from. Here we will use DSPy's metrics, though you can write your own.


```python
# Define the signature for autoamtic assessments.
class Assess(dspy.Signature):
    """Assess the quality of a tweet along the specified dimension."""

    context = dspy.InputField(desc="ignore if N/A")
    assessed_text = dspy.InputField()
    assessment_question = dspy.InputField()

## Evaluate Baseline

Okay, let's evaluate the unoptimized "zero-shot" version of our chain, converted from our LangChain LCEL object.


```python
from dspy.evaluate.evaluate import Evaluate
```


```python
evaluate = Evaluate(
    metric=metric, devset=devset, num_threads=8, display_progress=True, display_table=5
)
evaluate(zeroshot_chain)
```

    Average Metric: 62.99999999999998 / 150  (42.0): 100%|██| 150/150 [01:14<00:00,  2.02it/s]

Okay, cool. Our zeroshot_chain gets about 42.00% on the 150 questions from the devset.

The table above shows some examples. For instance:

- Question: Who was a producer who produced albums for both rock bands Juke Karten and Thirty Seconds to Mars?

- Tweet: Brian Virtue, who has worked with bands like Jane's Addiction and Velvet Revolver, produced albums for both Juke Kartel and Thirty Seconds to Mars, showcasing... [truncated]

- Metric: 1.0 (A tweet that is correct, faithful, and engaging!*)

footnote: * At least according to our metric, which is just a DSPy program, so it too can be optimized if you'd like! Topic for another notebook, though.

## Optimize

Now, let's optimize performance


```python
from dspy.teleprompt import BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch
```


```python
# Set up the optimizer. We'll use very minimal hyperparameters for this example.
# Just do random search with ~3 attempts, and in each attempt, bootstrap <= 3 traces.
optimizer = BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch(
    metric=metric, max_bootstrapped_demos=3, num_candidate_programs=3
)

# Now use the optimizer to *compile* the chain. This could take 5-10 minutes, unless it's cached.
optimized_chain = optimizer.compile(zeroshot_chain, trainset=trainset, valset=valset)
```

    Going to sample between 1 and 3 traces per predictor.
    Will attempt to train 3 candidate sets.

# How to add dynamic breakpoints

Human-in-the-loop (HIL) interactions are crucial for [agentic systems](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/agentic_concepts/#human-in-the-loop). [Breakpoints](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/low_level/#breakpoints) are a common HIL interaction pattern, allowing the graph to stop at specific steps and seek human approval before proceeding (e.g., for sensitive actions).

In LangGraph you can add breakpoints before / after a node is executed. But oftentimes it may be helpful to **dynamically** interrupt the graph from inside a given node based on some condition. When doing so, it may also be helpful to include information about **why** that interrupt was raised.

This guide shows how you can dynamically interrupt the graph using `NodeInterrupt` -- a special exception that can be raised from inside a node. Let's see it in action!

## Setup

First, let's install the required packages


```python
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U langgraph
```

<div class="admonition tip">
    <p class="admonition-title">Set up <a href="https://smith.langchain.com">LangSmith</a> for LangGraph development</p>

    </p>
</div>

## Define the graph


```python
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
from IPython.display import Image, display

from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from langgraph.errors import NodeInterrupt


class State(TypedDict):
    input: str


def step_1(state: State) -> State:
    print("---Step 1---")
    return state


def step_2(state: State) -> State:
    # Let's optionally raise a NodeInterrupt
    # if the length of the input is longer than 5 characters
    if len(state["input"]) > 5:
        raise NodeInterrupt(
            f"Received input that is longer than 5 characters: {state['input']}"
        )

    print("---Step 2---")
    return state


def step_3(state: State) -> State:
    print("---Step 3---")
    return state


builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_node("step_1", step_1)
builder.add_node("step_2", step_2)
builder.add_node("step_3", step_3)
builder.add_edge(START, "step_1")
builder.add_edge("step_1", "step_2")
builder.add_edge("step_2", "step_3")
builder.add_edge("step_3", END)

# Set up memory
memory = MemorySaver()

# Compile the graph with memory
graph = builder.compile(checkpointer=memory)

# View
display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))
```


    
![jpeg](output_5_0.jpg)
    


## Run the graph with dynamic interrupt

First, let's run the graph with an input that <= 5 characters long. This should safely ignore the interrupt condition we defined and return the original input at the end of the graph execution.


```python
initial_input = {"input": "hello"}
thread_config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}

for event in graph.stream(initial_input, thread_config, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)
```

    {'input': 'hello'}
    ---Step 1---
    {'input': 'hello'}
    ---Step 2---
    {'input': 'hello'}
    ---Step 3---
    {'input': 'hello'}
    

If we inspect the graph at this point, we can see that there are no more tasks left to run and that the graph indeed finished execution.


```python
state = graph.get_state(thread_config)
print(state.next)
print(state.tasks)
```

    ()
    ()
    

Now, let's run the graph with an input that's longer than 5 characters. This should trigger the dynamic interrupt we defined via raising a `NodeInterrupt` error inside the `step_2` node.


```python
initial_input = {"input": "hello world"}
thread_config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "2"}}

# Run the graph until the first interruption
for event in graph.stream(initial_input, thread_config, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)
```

    {'input': 'hello world'}
    ---Step 1---
    {'input': 'hello world'}
    

We can see that the graph now stopped while executing `step_2`. If we inspect the graph state at this point, we can see the information on what node is set to execute next (`step_2`), as well as what node raised the interrupt (also `step_2`), and additional information about the interrupt.


```python
state = graph.get_state(thread_config)
print(state.next)
print(state.tasks)
```

    ('step_2',)
    (PregelTask(id='365d4518-bcff-5abd-8ef5-8a0de7f510b0', name='step_2', error=None, interrupts=(Interrupt(value='Received input that is longer than 5 characters: hello world', when='during'),)),)
    

If we try to resume the graph from the breakpoint, we will simply interrupt again as our inputs & graph state haven't changed.


```python
# NOTE: to resume the graph from a dynamic interrupt we use the same syntax as with regular interrupts -- we pass None as the input
for event in graph.stream(None, thread_config, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)
```


```python
state = graph.get_state(thread_config)
print(state.next)
print(state.tasks)
```

    ('step_2',)
    (PregelTask(id='365d4518-bcff-5abd-8ef5-8a0de7f510b0', name='step_2', error=None, interrupts=(Interrupt(value='Received input that is longer than 5 characters: hello world', when='during'),)),)
    

## Update the graph state

To get around it, we can do several things. 

First, we could simply run the graph on a different thread with a shorter input, like we did in the beginning. Alternatively, if we want to resume the graph execution from the breakpoint, we can update the state to have an input that's shorter than 5 characters (the condition for our interrupt).


```python
# NOTE: this update will be applied as of the last successful node before the interrupt, i.e. `step_1`, right before the node with an interrupt
graph.update_state(config=thread_config, values={"input": "foo"})
for event in graph.stream(None, thread_config, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)

state = graph.get_state(thread_config)
print(state.next)
print(state.values)
```

    ---Step 2---
    {'input': 'foo'}
    ---Step 3---
    {'input': 'foo'}
    ()
    {'input': 'foo'}
    

You can also update the state **as node `step_2`** (interrupted node) which would skip over that node altogether


```python
initial_input = {"input": "hello world"}
thread_config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "3"}}

# Run the graph until the first interruption
for event in graph.stream(initial_input, thread_config, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)
```

    {'input': 'hello world'}
    ---Step 1---
    {'input': 'hello world'}
    


```python
# NOTE: this update will skip the node `step_2` altogether
graph.update_state(config=thread_config, values=None, as_node="step_2")
for event in graph.stream(None, thread_config, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)

state = graph.get_state(thread_config)
print(state.next)
print(state.values)
```

    ---Step 3---
    {'input': 'hello world'}
    ()
    {'input': 'hello world'}

# How to create a dynamic (self-constructing) chain

:::info Prerequisites

This guide assumes familiarity with the following:
- [LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)](/docs/concepts/lcel)
- [How to turn any function into a runnable](/docs/how_to/functions)

:::

Sometimes we want to construct parts of a chain at runtime, depending on the chain inputs ([routing](/docs/how_to/routing/) is the most common example of this). We can create dynamic chains like this using a very useful property of RunnableLambda's, which is that if a RunnableLambda returns a Runnable, that Runnable is itself invoked. Let's see an example.

import ChatModelTabs from "@theme/ChatModelTabs";

<ChatModelTabs
  customVarName="llm"
/>



```python
# | echo: false

from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic

llm = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-sonnet-20240229")
```


```python
from operator import itemgetter

from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_core.runnables import Runnable, RunnablePassthrough, chain

contextualize_instructions = """Convert the latest user question into a standalone question given the chat history. Don't answer the question, return the question and nothing else (no descriptive text)."""
contextualize_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [
        ("system", contextualize_instructions),
        ("placeholder", "{chat_history}"),
        ("human", "{question}"),
    ]
)
contextualize_question = contextualize_prompt | llm | StrOutputParser()

qa_instructions = (
    """Answer the user question given the following context:\n\n{context}."""
)
qa_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [("system", qa_instructions), ("human", "{question}")]
)


@chain
def contextualize_if_needed(input_: dict) -> Runnable:
    if input_.get("chat_history"):
        # NOTE: This is returning another Runnable, not an actual output.
        return contextualize_question
    else:
        return RunnablePassthrough() | itemgetter("question")


@chain
def fake_retriever(input_: dict) -> str:
    return "egypt's population in 2024 is about 111 million"


full_chain = (
    RunnablePassthrough.assign(question=contextualize_if_needed).assign(
        context=fake_retriever
    )
    | qa_prompt
    | llm
    | StrOutputParser()
)

full_chain.invoke(
    {
        "question": "what about egypt",
        "chat_history": [
            ("human", "what's the population of indonesia"),
            ("ai", "about 276 million"),
        ],
    }
)
```




    "According to the context provided, Egypt's population in 2024 is estimated to be about 111 million."



The key here is that `contextualize_if_needed` returns another Runnable and not an actual output. This returned Runnable is itself run when the full chain is executed.

Looking at the trace we can see that, since we passed in chat_history, we executed the contextualize_question chain as part of the full chain: https://smith.langchain.com/public/9e0ae34c-4082-4f3f-beed-34a2a2f4c991/r

Note that the streaming, batching, etc. capabilities of the returned Runnable are all preserved


```python
for chunk in contextualize_if_needed.stream(
    {
        "question": "what about egypt",
        "chat_history": [
            ("human", "what's the population of indonesia"),
            ("ai", "about 276 million"),
        ],
    }
):
    print(chunk)
```

    What
     is
     the
     population
     of
     Egypt
    ?

# E2B Data Analysis

[E2B's cloud environments](https://e2b.dev) are great runtime sandboxes for LLMs.

E2B's Data Analysis sandbox allows for safe code execution in a sandboxed environment. This is ideal for building tools such as code interpreters, or Advanced Data Analysis like in ChatGPT.

E2B Data Analysis sandbox allows you to:
- Run Python code
- Generate charts via matplotlib
- Install Python packages dynamically during runtime
- Install system packages dynamically during runtime
- Run shell commands
- Upload and download files

We'll create a simple OpenAI agent that will use E2B's Data Analysis sandbox to perform analysis on a uploaded files using Python.

Get your OpenAI API key and [E2B API key here](https://e2b.dev/docs/getting-started/api-key) and set them as environment variables.

You can find the full API documentation [here](https://e2b.dev/docs).


You'll need to install `e2b` to get started:


```python
%pip install --upgrade --quiet  langchain e2b langchain-community
```


```python
from langchain_community.tools import E2BDataAnalysisTool
```


```python
import os

from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

os.environ["E2B_API_KEY"] = "<E2B_API_KEY>"
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "<OPENAI_API_KEY>"
```

When creating an instance of the `E2BDataAnalysisTool`, you can pass callbacks to listen to the output of the sandbox. This is useful, for example, when creating more responsive UI. Especially with the combination of streaming output from LLMs.


```python
# Artifacts are charts created by matplotlib when `plt.show()` is called
def save_artifact(artifact):
    print("New matplotlib chart generated:", artifact.name)
    # Download the artifact as `bytes` and leave it up to the user to display them (on frontend, for example)
    file = artifact.download()
    basename = os.path.basename(artifact.name)

    # Save the chart to the `charts` directory
    with open(f"./charts/{basename}", "wb") as f:
        f.write(file)


e2b_data_analysis_tool = E2BDataAnalysisTool(
    # Pass environment variables to the sandbox
    env_vars={"MY_SECRET": "secret_value"},
    on_stdout=lambda stdout: print("stdout:", stdout),
    on_stderr=lambda stderr: print("stderr:", stderr),
    on_artifact=save_artifact,
)
```

Upload an example CSV data file to the sandbox so we can analyze it with our agent. You can use for example [this file](https://storage.googleapis.com/e2b-examples/netflix.csv) about Netflix tv shows.


```python
with open("./netflix.csv") as f:
    remote_path = e2b_data_analysis_tool.upload_file(
        file=f,
        description="Data about Netflix tv shows including their title, category, director, release date, casting, age rating, etc.",
    )
    print(remote_path)
```

    name='netflix.csv' remote_path='/home/user/netflix.csv' description='Data about Netflix tv shows including their title, category, director, release date, casting, age rating, etc.'
    

Create a `Tool` object and initialize the Langchain agent.


```python
tools = [e2b_data_analysis_tool.as_tool()]

llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4", temperature=0)
agent = initialize_agent(
    tools,
    llm,
    agent=AgentType.OPENAI_FUNCTIONS,
    verbose=True,
    handle_parsing_errors=True,
)
```

Now we can ask the agent questions about the CSV file we uploaded earlier.


```python
agent.run(
    "What are the 5 longest movies on netflix released between 2000 and 2010? Create a chart with their lengths."
)
```

# China Mobile ECloud ElasticSearch VectorSearch

>[China Mobile ECloud VectorSearch](https://ecloud.10086.cn/portal/product/elasticsearch) is a fully managed, enterprise-level distributed search and analysis service. China Mobile ECloud VectorSearch provides low-cost, high-performance, and reliable retrieval and analysis platform level product services for structured/unstructured data. As a vector database , it supports multiple index types and similarity distance methods. 

You'll need to install `langchain-community` with `pip install -qU langchain-community` to use this integration

This notebook shows how to use functionality related to the `ECloud ElasticSearch VectorStore`.
To run, you should have an [China Mobile ECloud VectorSearch](https://ecloud.10086.cn/portal/product/elasticsearch) instance up and running:

Read the [help document](https://ecloud.10086.cn/op-help-center/doc/category/1094) to quickly familiarize and configure China Mobile ECloud ElasticSearch instance.

After the instance is up and running, follow these steps to split documents, get embeddings, connect to the baidu cloud elasticsearch instance, index documents, and perform vector retrieval.


```python
#!pip install elasticsearch == 7.10.1
```

First, we want to use `OpenAIEmbeddings` so we have to get the OpenAI API Key.


```python
import getpass
import os

if "OPENAI_API_KEY" not in os.environ:
    os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("OpenAI API Key:")
```

Secondly, split documents and get embeddings.


```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import TextLoader
from langchain_community.vectorstores import EcloudESVectorStore
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain_text_splitters import CharacterTextSplitter
```


```python
loader = TextLoader("../../../state_of_the_union.txt")
documents = loader.load()
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
docs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)

embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()

ES_URL = "http://localhost:9200"
USER = "your user name"
PASSWORD = "your password"
indexname = "your index name"
```

then, index documents


```python
docsearch = EcloudESVectorStore.from_documents(
    docs,
    embeddings,
    es_url=ES_URL,
    user=USER,
    password=PASSWORD,
    index_name=indexname,
    refresh_indices=True,
)
```

Finally, Query and retrive data


```python
query = "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"
docs = docsearch.similarity_search(query, k=10)
print(docs[0].page_content)
```

A commonly used case


```python
def test_dense_float_vectore_lsh_cosine() -> None:

- **Monitoring and Observability**: `EdenAI` provides comprehensive monitoring and observability tools on the platform. Monitor the performance of your language models, analyze usage patterns, and gain valuable insights to optimize your applications.


Accessing the EDENAI's API requires an API key, 

which you can get by creating an account https://app.edenai.run/user/register  and heading here https://app.edenai.run/admin/iam/api-keys

Once we have a key we'll want to set it as an environment variable by running:

```bash
export EDENAI_API_KEY="..."
```

You can find more details on the API reference : https://docs.edenai.co/reference

If you'd prefer not to set an environment variable you can pass the key in directly via the edenai_api_key named parameter

 when initiating the EdenAI Chat Model class.


```python
from langchain_community.chat_models.edenai import ChatEdenAI
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage
```


```python
chat = ChatEdenAI(
    edenai_api_key="...", provider="openai", temperature=0.2, max_tokens=250
)
```


```python
messages = [HumanMessage(content="Hello !")]
chat.invoke(messages)
```




    AIMessage(content='Hello! How can I assist you today?')




```python
await chat.ainvoke(messages)
```




    AIMessage(content='Hello! How can I assist you today?')



## Streaming and Batching

`ChatEdenAI` supports streaming and batching. Below is an example.


```python
for chunk in chat.stream(messages):
    print(chunk.content, end="", flush=True)
```

    Hello! How can I assist you today?


```python
chat.batch([messages])
```




    [AIMessage(content='Hello! How can I assist you today?')]



## Fallback mecanism

With Eden AI you can set a fallback mechanism to ensure seamless operations even if the primary provider is unavailable, you can easily switches to an alternative provider.


```python
chat = ChatEdenAI(
    edenai_api_key="...",
    provider="openai",
    temperature=0.2,
    max_tokens=250,
    fallback_providers="google",
)
```

In this example, you can use Google as a backup provider if OpenAI encounters any issues.

For more information and details about Eden AI, check out this link: : https://docs.edenai.co/docs/additional-parameters

## Chaining Calls



```python
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(
    "What is a good name for a company that makes {product}?"
)
chain = prompt | chat
```


```python
chain.invoke({"product": "healthy snacks"})
```




    AIMessage(content='VitalBites')



## Tools

### bind_tools()

With `ChatEdenAI.bind_tools`, we can easily pass in Pydantic classes, dict schemas, LangChain tools, or even functions as tools to the model.


```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

llm = ChatEdenAI(provider="openai", temperature=0.2, max_tokens=500)


class GetWeather(BaseModel):
    """Get the current weather in a given location"""

    location: str = Field(..., description="The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA")


llm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools([GetWeather])
```


```python
ai_msg = llm_with_tools.invoke(
    "what is the weather like in San Francisco",
)
ai_msg
```




    AIMessage(content='', response_metadata={'openai': {'status': 'success', 'generated_text': None, 'message': [{'role': 'user', 'message': 'what is the weather like in San Francisco', 'tools': [{'name': 'GetWeather', 'description': 'Get the current weather in a given location', 'parameters': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'location': {'description': 'The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['location']}}], 'tool_calls': None}, {'role': 'assistant', 'message': None, 'tools': None, 'tool_calls': [{'id': 'call_tRpAO7KbQwgTjlka70mCQJdo', 'name': 'GetWeather', 'arguments': '{"location":"San Francisco"}'}]}], 'cost': 0.000194}}, id='run-5c44c01a-d7bb-4df6-835e-bda596080399-0', tool_calls=[{'name': 'GetWeather', 'args': {'location': 'San Francisco'}, 'id': 'call_tRpAO7KbQwgTjlka70mCQJdo'}])




```python
ai_msg.tool_calls
```




    [{'name': 'GetWeather',
      'args': {'location': 'San Francisco'},
      'id': 'call_tRpAO7KbQwgTjlka70mCQJdo'}]



### with_structured_output()

The BaseChatModel.with_structured_output interface makes it easy to get structured output from chat models. You can use ChatEdenAI.with_structured_output, which uses tool-calling under the hood), to get the model to more reliably return an output in a specific format:



```python
structured_llm = llm.with_structured_output(GetWeather)
structured_llm.invoke(
    "what is the weather like in San Francisco",
)
```




    GetWeather(location='San Francisco')



### Passing Tool Results to model

Here is a full example of how to use a tool. Pass the tool output to the model, and get the result back from the model


```python
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage, ToolMessage
from langchain_core.tools import tool


@tool
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Adds a and b.

    Args:
        a: first int
        b: second int
    """
    return a + b


llm = ChatEdenAI(
    provider="openai",
    max_tokens=1000,
    temperature=0.2,
)

llm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools([add], tool_choice="required")

query = "What is 11 + 11?"

messages = [HumanMessage(query)]
ai_msg = llm_with_tools.invoke(messages)
messages.append(ai_msg)

tool_call = ai_msg.tool_calls[0]
tool_output = add.invoke(tool_call["args"])

# This append the result from our tool to the model
messages.append(ToolMessage(tool_output, tool_call_id=tool_call["id"]))

llm_with_tools.invoke(messages).content
```




    '11 + 11 = 22'



### Streaming

Eden AI does not currently support streaming tool calls. Attempting to stream will yield a single final message.


```python
list(llm_with_tools.stream("What's 9 + 9"))
```

    /home/eden/Projects/edenai-langchain/libs/community/langchain_community/chat_models/edenai.py:603: UserWarning: stream: Tool use is not yet supported in streaming mode.
      warnings.warn("stream: Tool use is not yet supported in streaming mode.")
    




    [AIMessageChunk(content='', id='run-fae32908-ec48-4ab2-ad96-bb0d0511754f', tool_calls=[{'name': 'add', 'args': {'a': 9, 'b': 9}, 'id': 'call_n0Tm7I9zERWa6UpxCAVCweLN'}], tool_call_chunks=[{'name': 'add', 'args': '{"a": 9, "b": 9}', 'id': 'call_n0Tm7I9zERWa6UpxCAVCweLN', 'index': 0}])]

# Eden AI

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how to use Eden AI tools with an Agent.

Eden AI is revolutionizing the AI landscape by uniting the best AI providers, empowering users to unlock limitless possibilities and tap into the true potential of artificial intelligence. With an all-in-one comprehensive and hassle-free platform, it allows users to deploy AI features to production lightning fast, enabling effortless access to the full breadth of AI capabilities via a single API. (website: https://edenai.co/ )


By including an Edenai tool in the list of tools provided to an Agent, you can grant your Agent the ability to do multiple tasks, such as:

- speech to text
- text to speech
- text explicit content detection 
- image explicit content detection
- object detection
- OCR invoice parsing
- OCR ID parsing


In this example, we will go through the process of utilizing the Edenai tools to create an Agent that can perform some of the tasks listed above.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Accessing the EDENAI's API requires an API key, 

which you can get by creating an account https://app.edenai.run/user/register  and heading here https://app.edenai.run/admin/account/settings

Once we have a key we'll want to set it as the environment variable ``EDENAI_API_KEY`` or you can pass the key in directly via the edenai_api_key named parameter when initiating the EdenAI tools, e.g. ``EdenAiTextModerationTool(edenai_api_key="...")``


```python
%pip install --upgrade --quiet langchain-community
```


```python
from langchain_community.tools.edenai import (
    EdenAiExplicitImageTool,
    EdenAiObjectDetectionTool,
    EdenAiParsingIDTool,
    EdenAiParsingInvoiceTool,
    EdenAiSpeechToTextTool,
    EdenAiTextModerationTool,
    EdenAiTextToSpeechTool,
)
```


```python
from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent
from langchain_community.llms import EdenAI

llm = EdenAI(
    feature="text", provider="openai", params={"temperature": 0.2, "max_tokens": 250}

    EdenAiExplicitImageTool(providers=["amazon", "google"]),
    EdenAiSpeechToTextTool(providers=["amazon"]),
    EdenAiParsingIDTool(providers=["amazon", "klippa"], language="en"),
    EdenAiParsingInvoiceTool(providers=["amazon", "google"], language="en"),
]
agent_chain = initialize_agent(
    tools,
    llm,

# How to edit graph state

Human-in-the-loop (HIL) interactions are crucial for [agentic systems](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/agentic_concepts/#human-in-the-loop). Manually updating the graph state a common HIL interaction pattern, allowing the human to edit actions (e.g., what tool is being called or how it is being called).

We can implement this in LangGraph using a [breakpoint](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/human_in_the_loop/breakpoints/): breakpoints allow us to interrupt graph execution before a specific step. At this breakpoint, we can manually update the graph state and then resume from that spot to continue.  

![edit_graph_state.png](1a5388fe-fa93-4607-a009-d71fe2223f5a.png)

## Setup

First we need to install the packages required


```python
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install --quiet -U langgraph langchain_anthropic
```

Next, we need to set API keys for Anthropic (the LLM we will use)


```python
import getpass
import os


def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")


_set_env("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")
```

    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY:  ········

    </p>
</div>

## Simple Usage

Let's look at very basic usage of this.

Below, we do three things:

1) We specify the [breakpoint](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/low_level/#breakpoints) using `interrupt_before` a specified step (node).

2) We set up a [checkpointer](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/low_level/#checkpointer) to save the state of the graph up until this node.

3) We use `.update_state` to update the state of the graph.


```python
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from IPython.display import Image, display


class State(TypedDict):
    input: str


def step_1(state):
    print("---Step 1---")
    pass


def step_2(state):
    print("---Step 2---")
    pass


def step_3(state):
    print("---Step 3---")
    pass


builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_node("step_1", step_1)
builder.add_node("step_2", step_2)
builder.add_node("step_3", step_3)
builder.add_edge(START, "step_1")
builder.add_edge("step_1", "step_2")
builder.add_edge("step_2", "step_3")
builder.add_edge("step_3", END)

# Set up memory
memory = MemorySaver()

# Add
graph = builder.compile(checkpointer=memory, interrupt_before=["step_2"])

# View
display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))
```


    
![jpeg](output_7_0.jpg)
    



```python
# Input
initial_input = {"input": "hello world"}

# Thread
thread = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}

# Run the graph until the first interruption
for event in graph.stream(initial_input, thread, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)
```

    {'input': 'hello world'}
    ---Step 1---
    

Now, we can just manually update our graph state - 


```python
print("Current state!")
print(graph.get_state(thread).values)

graph.update_state(thread, {"input": "hello universe!"})

print("---\n---\nUpdated state!")
print(graph.get_state(thread).values)
```

    Current state!
    {'input': 'hello world'}
    ---
    ---
    Updated state!
    {'input': 'hello universe!'}
    


```python
# Continue the graph execution
for event in graph.stream(None, thread, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)
```

    ---Step 2---
    ---Step 3---
    

## Agent

In the context of agents, updating state is useful for things like editing tool calls.
 
To show this, we will build a relatively simple ReAct-style agent that does tool calling. 

We will use Anthropic's models and a fake tool (just for demo purposes).


```python
# Set up the tool
from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic
from langchain_core.tools import tool
from langgraph.graph import MessagesState, START, END, StateGraph
from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver


@tool
def search(query: str):
    """Call to surf the web."""
    # This is a placeholder for the actual implementation
    # Don't let the LLM know this though 😊
    return [
        "It's sunny in San Francisco, but you better look out if you're a Gemini 😈."
    ]


tools = [search]
tool_node = ToolNode(tools)

# Set up the model

model = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620")
model = model.bind_tools(tools)


# Define nodes and conditional edges


# Define the function that determines whether to continue or not
def should_continue(state):
    messages = state["messages"]
    last_message = messages[-1]
    # If there is no function call, then we finish
    if not last_message.tool_calls:
        return "end"
    # Otherwise if there is, we continue
    else:
        return "continue"


# Define the function that calls the model
def call_model(state):
    messages = state["messages"]
    response = model.invoke(messages)
    # We return a list, because this will get added to the existing list
    return {"messages": [response]}


# Define a new graph
workflow = StateGraph(MessagesState)

# Define the two nodes we will cycle between
workflow.add_node("agent", call_model)
workflow.add_node("action", tool_node)

# Set the entrypoint as `agent`
# This means that this node is the first one called
workflow.add_edge(START, "agent")

# We now add a conditional edge
workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    # First, we define the start node. We use `agent`.
    # This means these are the edges taken after the `agent` node is called.
    "agent",
    # Next, we pass in the function that will determine which node is called next.
    should_continue,
    # Finally we pass in a mapping.
    # The keys are strings, and the values are other nodes.
    # END is a special node marking that the graph should finish.
    # What will happen is we will call `should_continue`, and then the output of that
    # will be matched against the keys in this mapping.
    # Based on which one it matches, that node will then be called.
    {
        # If `tools`, then we call the tool node.
        "continue": "action",
        # Otherwise we finish.
        "end": END,
    },
)

# We now add a normal edge from `tools` to `agent`.
# This means that after `tools` is called, `agent` node is called next.
workflow.add_edge("action", "agent")

# Set up memory
memory = MemorySaver()

# Finally, we compile it!
# This compiles it into a LangChain Runnable,
# meaning you can use it as you would any other runnable

# We add in `interrupt_before=["action"]`
# This will add a breakpoint before the `action` node is called
app = workflow.compile(checkpointer=memory, interrupt_before=["action"])
```

## Interacting with the Agent

We can now interact with the agent and see that it stops before calling a tool.



```python
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage

thread = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "3"}}
inputs = [HumanMessage(content="search for the weather in sf now")]
for event in app.stream({"messages": inputs}, thread, stream_mode="values"):
    event["messages"][-1].pretty_print()
```

    ================================[1m Human Message [0m=================================
    
    search for the weather in sf now
    ==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================
    
    [{'text': "Certainly! I'll search for the current weather in San Francisco for you. Let me use the search function to find this information.", 'type': 'text'}, {'id': 'toolu_01DxRhkj4fAvaGWoBhVuvfeL', 'input': {'query': 'current weather in San Francisco'}, 'name': 'search', 'type': 'tool_use'}]
    Tool Calls:
      search (toolu_01DxRhkj4fAvaGWoBhVuvfeL)
     Call ID: toolu_01DxRhkj4fAvaGWoBhVuvfeL
      Args:
        query: current weather in San Francisco
    

**Edit**

We can now update the state accordingly. Let's modify the tool call to have the query `"current weather in SF"`.


```python
# First, lets get the current state
current_state = app.get_state(thread)

# Let's now get the last message in the state
# This is the one with the tool calls that we want to update
last_message = current_state.values["messages"][-1]

# Let's now update the args for that tool call
last_message.tool_calls[0]["args"] = {"query": "current weather in SF"}

# Let's now call `update_state` to pass in this message in the `messages` key
# This will get treated as any other update to the state
# It will get passed to the reducer function for the `messages` key
# That reducer function will use the ID of the message to update it
# It's important that it has the right ID! Otherwise it would get appended
# as a new message
app.update_state(thread, {"messages": last_message})
```




    {'configurable': {'thread_id': '3',
      'checkpoint_ns': '',
      'checkpoint_id': '1ef7830a-c688-6fc6-8002-824126081ba0'}}



Let's now check the current state of the app to make sure it got updated accordingly


```python
current_state = app.get_state(thread).values["messages"][-1].tool_calls
current_state
```




    [{'name': 'search',
      'args': {'query': 'current weather in SF'},
      'id': 'toolu_01FSkinAVXR1C4D5kecrzAnj'}]



**Resume**

We can now call the agent again with no inputs to continue, ie. run the tool as requested. We can see from the logs that it passes in the update args to the tool.


```python
for event in app.stream(None, thread, stream_mode="values"):
    event["messages"][-1].pretty_print()
```

    =================================[1m Tool Message [0m=================================
    Name: search
    
    ["It's sunny in San Francisco, but you better look out if you're a Gemini \ud83d\ude08."]
    ==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================
    
    Based on the search results, I can provide you with the current weather information for San Francisco:
    
    The weather in San Francisco is currently sunny. 
    
    It's important to note that the search result also included a playful astrological reference, which isn't directly related to the weather. If you need more specific weather details like temperature, humidity, or forecast, please let me know, and I can perform another search to find that information for you.
    
    Is there anything else you'd like to know about the weather in San Francisco or any other location?

## Download the dataset 

In this step we download the OpenAI Wikipedia embeddings dataset, and extract the zip file.


```python
embeddings_url = 'https://cdn.openai.com/API/examples/data/vector_database_wikipedia_articles_embedded.zip'
wget.download(embeddings_url)

with zipfile.ZipFile("vector_database_wikipedia_articles_embedded.zip",
"r") as zip_ref:
    zip_ref.extractall("data")
```

##  Read CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.

Next we use the Pandas library to read the unzipped CSV file into a DataFrame. This step makes it easier to index the data into Elasticsearch in bulk.


```python

wikipedia_dataframe = pd.read_csv("data/vector_database_wikipedia_articles_embedded.csv")
```

## Create index with mapping

Now we need to create an Elasticsearch index with the necessary mappings. This will enable us to index the data into Elasticsearch.

We use the `dense_vector` field type for the `title_vector` and  `content_vector` fields. This is a special field type that allows us to store dense vectors in Elasticsearch.

Later, we'll need to target the `dense_vector` field for kNN search.



```python
index_mapping= {
    "properties": {
      "title_vector": {
          "type": "dense_vector",
          "dims": 1536,
          "index": "true",
          "similarity": "cosine"
      },
      "content_vector": {
          "type": "dense_vector",
          "dims": 1536,
          "index": "true",
          "similarity": "cosine"
      },
      "text": {"type": "text"},
      "title": {"type": "text"},
      "url": { "type": "keyword"},
      "vector_id": {"type": "long"}
      
    }
}

client.indices.create(index="wikipedia_vector_index", mappings=index_mapping)
```

## Index data into Elasticsearch 

The following function generates the required bulk actions that can be passed to Elasticsearch's Bulk API, so we can index multiple documents efficiently in a single request.

For each row in the DataFrame, the function yields a dictionary representing a single document to be indexed. 


```python
def dataframe_to_bulk_actions(df):
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        yield {
            "_index": 'wikipedia_vector_index',
            "_id": row['id'],
            "_source": {
                'url' : row["url"],
                'title' : row["title"],
                'text' : row["text"],
                'title_vector' : json.loads(row["title_vector"]),
                'content_vector' : json.loads(row["content_vector"]),
                'vector_id' : row["vector_id"]
            }
        }
```

As the dataframe is large, we will index data in batches of `100`. We index the data into Elasticsearch using the Python client's [helpers](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/python-api/current/client-helpers.html#bulk-helpers) for the bulk API.


```python
start = 0
end = len(wikipedia_dataframe)
batch_size = 100
for batch_start in range(start, end, batch_size):
    batch_end = min(batch_start + batch_size, end)
    batch_dataframe = wikipedia_dataframe.iloc[batch_start:batch_end]
    actions = dataframe_to_bulk_actions(batch_dataframe)
    helpers.bulk(client, actions)
```

Let's test the index with a simple match query.


```python
print(client.search(index="wikipedia_vector_index", body={
    "_source": {
        "excludes": ["title_vector", "content_vector"]
    },
    "query": {
        "match": {
            "text": {
                "query": "Hummingbird"
            }
        }
    }
}))
```

The smallest living bird species is the 2–5\xa0cm Bee Hummingbird. They can hover in mid-air by rapidly flapping their wings 12–80 times per second (depending on the species). They are also the only group of birds able to fly backwards. Their rapid wing beats do actually hum. They can fly at speeds over 15\xa0m/s (54\xa0km/h, 34\xa0mi/h).\n\nEating habits and pollination \nHummingbirds help flowers to pollinate, though most insects are best known for doing so. The hummingbird enjoys nectar, like the butterfly and other flower-loving insects, such as bees.\n\nHummingbirds do not have a good sense of smell; instead, they are attracted to color, especially the color red. Unlike the butterfly, the hummingbird hovers over the flower as it drinks nectar from it, like a moth. When it does so, it flaps its wings very quickly to stay in one place, which makes it look like a blur and also beats so fast it makes a humming sound. A hummingbird sometimes puts its whole head into the flower to drink the nectar properly. When it takes its head back out, its head is covered with yellow pollen, so that when it moves to another flower, it can pollinate. Or sometimes it may pollinate with its beak.\n\nLike bees, hummingbirds can assess the amount of sugar in the nectar they eat. They reject flowers whose nectar has less than 10% sugar. Nectar is a poor source of nutrients, so hummingbirds meet their needs for protein, amino acids, vitamins, minerals, etc. by preying on insects and spiders.\n\nFeeding apparatus \nMost hummingbirds have bills that are long and straight or nearly so, but in some species the bill shape is adapted for specialized feeding. Thornbills have short, sharp bills adapted for feeding from flowers with short corollas and piercing the bases of longer ones. The Sicklebills' extremely decurved bills are adapted to extracting nectar from the curved corollas of flowers in the family Gesneriaceae. The bill of the Fiery-tailed Awlbill has an upturned tip, as in the Avocets. The male Tooth-billed Hummingbird has barracuda-like spikes at the tip of its long, straight bill.\n\nThe two halves of a hummingbird's bill have a pronounced overlap, with the lower half (mandible) fitting tightly inside the upper half (maxilla). When hummingbirds feed on nectar, the bill is usually only opened slightly, allowing the tongue to dart out into the nectar.\n\nLike the similar nectar-feeding sunbirds and unlike other birds, hummingbirds drink by using grooved or trough-like tongues which they can stick out a long way.\nHummingbirds do not spend all day flying, as the energy cost would be prohibitive; the majority of their activity consists simply of sitting or perching. Hummingbirds feed in many small meals, consuming many small invertebrates and up to twelve times their own body weight in nectar each day. They spend an average of 10–15% of their time feeding and 75–80% sitting and digesting.\n\nCo-evolution with flowers\n\nSince hummingbirds are specialized nectar-eaters, they are tied to the bird-flowers they feed upon. Some species, especially those with unusual bill shapes such as the Sword-billed Hummingbird and the sicklebills, are co-evolved with a small number of flower species.\n\nMany plants pollinated by hummingbirds produce flowers in shades of red, orange, and bright pink, though the birds will take nectar from flowers of many colors. Hummingbirds can see wavelengths into the near-ultraviolet. However, their flowers do not reflect these wavelengths as many insect-pollinated flowers do. The narrow color spectrum may make hummingbird-pollinated flowers inconspicuous to insects, thereby reducing nectar robbing by insects. Hummingbird-pollinated flowers also produce relatively weak nectar (averaging 25% sugars w/w) containing high concentrations of sucrose, whereas insect-pollinated flowers typically produce more concentrated nectars dominated by fructose and glucose.\n\nTaxonomy \nHummingbirds have traditionally been a part of the bird order Apodiformes. This order includes the hummingbirds, the swifts and the tree swifts. The Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy of birds, based on DNA studies done in the 1970s and 1980s, changed the classification of hummingbirds. Instead of being in the same order as the swifts, the hummingbirds were made an order, the Trochiliformes. Their previous order, Apodiformes was changed to the superorder Apodimorphae. This superorder contains the three families of birds which were in it when it was an order.\n\nReferences", 'vector_id': 10024}}, {'_index': 'wikipedia_vector_index', '_id': '84773', '_score': 10.951234, '_source': {'url': 'https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inagua', 'title': 'Inagua', 'text': "Inagua is the southernmost district of the Bahamas.

Technically speaking, they are dinosaurs. \n\nBirds are endothermic. The heat loss from their bodies is slowed down by their feathers. \nModern birds are toothless: they have beaked jaws. They lay hard-shelled eggs. They have a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart and a strong yet lightweight skeleton.\n\nBirds live all over the world. They range in size from the 5 cm (2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.70 m (9 ft) ostrich. They are the tetrapods with the most living species: about ten thousand. More than half of these are passerines, sometimes known as perching birds.\n\nBirds are the closest living relatives of the Crocodilia. This is because they are the two main survivors of a once huge group called the Archosaurs. \n\nModern birds are not descended from Archaeopteryx. According to DNA evidence, modern birds (Neornithes) evolved in the long Upper Cretaceous period. More recent estimates showed that  modern birds originated early in the Upper Cretaceous.\n\nPrimitive bird-like dinosaurs are in the broader group Avialae. They have been found back to the mid-Jurassic period, around 170 million years ago. Many of these early "stem-birds", such as Anchiornis, were not yet capable of fully powered flight. Many had primitive characteristics like teeth in their jaws and long bony tails.p274\n\nThe Cretaceous–Palaeogene extinction event 66 million years ago killed off all the non-avian dinosaur lines. Birds, especially those in the southern continents, survived this event and then migrated to other parts of the world. Diversification occurred around the Cretaceous–Palaeogene extinction event. \n\nBirds have wings which are more or less developed depending on the species. The only known groups without wings are the extinct moa and elephant birds. Wings, which evolved from forelimbs, gave birds the ability to fly. Later, many groups evolved with reduced wings, such as ratites, penguins and many island species of birds. The digestive and respiratory systems of birds are also adapted for flight. Some bird species in aquatic environments, particularly seabirds and some waterbirds, have evolved as good swimmers.\n\nIn general, birds are effective, and inherit their behaviour almost entirely. The key elements of their life are inherited. It was a great discovery that birds never learn to fly. \nSo it is quite wrong to say, when a chick waves its wings in the nest "It\'s learning to fly". What the chick is doing is exercising its muscles. They develop the ability to fly automatically (assuming they are species that do fly). And if they are species which migrate, that behaviour is also inherited. Many species migrate over great distances each year. Other main features of their life may be inherited, though they can and do learn. Birds have good memories which they use, for example, when they search for food.\n\nSeveral bird species make and use tools. Some social species pass on some knowledge across generations, a form of culture. Birds are social. They communicate with visual signals, calls and bird songs. Most of their social behaviours are inherited, such as cooperative breeding and hunting, flocking and mobbing of predators.\n\nMost bird species are socially monogamous, usually for one breeding season at a time, sometimes for years, but rarely for life. Other species are polygynous (one male with many females) or, rarely, polyandrous (one female with many males). Birds produce offspring by laying eggs which are fertilised by sexual reproduction. They are often laid in a nest and incubated by the parents. Most birds have an extended period of parental care after hatching. Some birds, such as hens, lay eggs even when not fertilised, though unfertilised eggs do not produce offspring.\n\nMany species of birds are eaten by humans. Domesticated and undomesticated birds are sources of eggs, meat, and feathers.  In English, domesticated birds are often called poultry, undomesticated birds are called game. Songbirds, parrots and other species are popular as pets. Guano, which is bird manure, is harvested for use as a fertiliser. Birds figure throughout human culture. About 120–130 species have become extinct due to human activity since the 17th century and hundreds more before then. Human activity threatens about 1,200 bird species with extinction, though efforts are underway to protect them. Recreational bird-watching is an important part of the ecotourism industry.\n\nBird colours \n\nBirds come in a huge range of colours. These colours can be useful to a bird in two ways. Camouflage colours help to hide the bird, and bright colours identify the bird to others of the same species. Often the male is brightly coloured while the female is camouflaged. The logic is as follows: the female carries the "precious package" of developing eggs. The male has to defend a territory, and the function of his colour and song is to let others know that "this place is occupied".\n\nBird camouflage \n\nMany birds are brown, green or grey. These colours make a bird harder to be seen: they camouflage the bird. Brown is the most common colour. Brown birds include: sparrows, emus, thrushes, larks, eagles and falcons and the female birds of many species such as: wrens, ducks, blackbirds and peafowls. When a brown bird is in long grass or among tree trunks or rocks, it is camouflaged. Birds that live in long grass often have brown feathers streaked with black which looks like shadows. A bittern is almost invisible in long reeds because its camouflage is helped by its posture (beak and head pointed upwards). Other birds, including starlings and mynas, are quite dark in colour, but are flecked with little spots that look like raindrops on leaves. Bird may also camouflage their nests.\n\nMany birds from hot countries are green or have some green feathers, particularly parrots. Birds that live in green trees often have green backs, even if they have bright-coloured breasts. From the back, the birds are camouflaged. This is very useful when sitting on a nest. The bird\'s bright-coloured breast is hidden. Budgerigars are bred in different colours such as blue, white and mauve, but in the wild, they are nearly all green and yellow. Even though they fly very well, they normally spend a lot of time on the ground, eating grass seeds. Their yellow and black striped back helps to hide them in the shadows made by long dry grass, while their green breasts are a similar colour to the leaves of gum trees.\n\nGrey birds include most pigeons and doves, cranes, storks and herons. Grey birds are often rock-living birds like pigeons or birds that sit on dead tree trunks looking like a broken branch. Water birds like herons often have a pale grey colour which makes it harder for a fish to notice that the bird is standing, looking down for something to catch. Water birds, no matter what colour they are on top, are often white underneath, so that when a fish looks up, the bird looks like part of the sky.\n\nBlack birds include crows, ravens and male blackbirds. Some birds that are dark colours spend quite a lot of time on the ground, hopping around in the shadows under bushes. Among these birds are the male blackbird and the satin bowerbird which is not black but very dark blue. Crows and ravens often perch high on bare trees in the winter, where their black shape against the sky looks like the dark bare branches.\n\nNoticeable colours \n\nMany birds are not camouflaged, but stand out with vivid colours. They are usually male birds whose females are dull and camouflaged. The function of the colours is two-fold. First, the colours help them get mates, and second, the colours identify them to other males of the same species. Many birds are territorial, especially in the nesting season. They give out territory sounds and are easily seen. This lets other males know they will defend their territory. It sends out a "look elsewhere" signal to their competitors.\n\nSome birds are famous for their colour and are named for it, such as the bluebird, the azure kingfisher, the golden pheasant, the scarlet macaw, the violet wren and the robin.\n\nMany other birds are very brightly coloured, in countless combinations. Some of the most colourful birds are quite common, like pheasants, peacocks, domestic fowl and parrots. Colourful small birds include blue tits, the goldfinches, hummingbirds, fairy wrens and bee eaters (which are also called rainbow birds). Some birds, like those of the bird of paradise in Papua New Guinea have such beautiful feathers that they have been hunted for them.\n\nThe peafowl is the best example of a display of colour to attract a mate. Also the male domestic fowl and junglefowl have long shiny feathers above his tail and also long neck feathers that may be a different colour to his wings and body. There are only a very few types of birds (like the eclectus parrot) where the female is more colourful than the male.\n\n\'\'Pied birds\'\' are black and white. Black and white birds include magpies, pied geese, pelicans and Australian magpies (which are not really magpies at all). Pied birds often have brightly coloured beaks and legs of yellow or red. The silver pheasant, with its long white tail striped with fine bars of black, has a brightly coloured face.\n\nFlight \nMost birds can fly, and if they do, then the ability is inherited, not learnt. They fly by pushing through the air with their wings. The curved surfaces of the wings cause air currents (wind) which lift the bird. Flapping keeps the air current moving to create lift and also moves the bird forward.\n\nSome birds can glide on air currents without flapping. Many birds use this method when they are about to land. Some birds can also hover in the air. This method is used by birds of prey such as falcons that are looking for something to eat. Seagulls are also good at hovering, particularly if there is a strong breeze. The most expert hovering birds are tiny hummingbirds which can beat their wings both backwards and forwards and can stay quite still in the air while they dip their long beaks into flowers to feed on the sweet nectar.\n\nTypes of flight \nDifferent types of birds have different needs. Their wings have evolved to suit their lifestyle. Large birds of prey, such as eagles, spend a lot of time soaring on the wind. They have wings that are large and broad. The main flight feathers are long and wide. They help the eagle to stay on rising air currents without using much energy, while the eagle looks at the ground below, to find the next meal. When the eagle sees some small creature move, it can close its wings and fall from the sky like a missile, opening its great wings again to slow down as it comes to land. The world\'s largest eagle, the Philippine eagle has a wingspan of about 2 m (6.7\xa0ft) wide.\n\nBirds that live in grassland areas or open forests and feed on fruit, insects and reptiles often spend a lot of time flying short journeys looking for food and water. They have wings that are shaped in a similar way to eagles, but rounder and not as good for soaring. These include many Australian birds like cockatoos.\n\nBirds such as geese that migrate from one country to another fly very long distances. Their wings are big and strong, because the birds are large. They stock up on food for the long flight. Migrating water birds usually form family groups of 1230 birds. They fly very high, making use of long streams of air that blow from north to south in different seasons. They are well organised, often flying in a V pattern. The geese at the back do not have to flap so hard; they are pulled on by the wind of the ones at the front. Every so often, they change the leader so that the front bird, who does most work and sets the pace, can have a rest. Geese and swans are the highest-flying birds, reaching 8,000 metres or more when on migration. Geese often honk loudly while they are flying. It is thought that they do this to support the leader and help the young ones.\n\nBirds that fly very quickly, such as swifts and swallows, have long narrow pointed wings. These birds need great speed because they eat insects, catching most of them while they are flying. These birds also migrate. They often collect in huge flocks of thousands of birds that move together like a whirling cloud.\n\nBirds that live in bushes and branches have triangular wings that help the bird change direction. Many forest birds are expert at getting up speed by flapping and then gliding steadily among the trees, tilting to avoid things as they go. Members of the kingfisher family are expert at this type of flying.\n\nBirds such as owls that hunt at night have wings with soft rounded feathers so that they do not flap loudly. Birds that are awake at night are called nocturnal birds. Birds that are awake during the day are diurnal.\n\nWandering albatross might spend several years without coming to land. They can sleep while gliding. Arctic terns nest every one to three years.\n\nFlocks \nFlocks of birds can be very highly organised in a way that takes care of all the flock members. Studies of small flocking birds like tree sparrows show that they clearly communicate with each other, as sometimes thousands of birds may fly in close formation and spiral patterns without colliding (or flying into each other).\n\nTwo common behaviours in flocking birds are guarding and reconnaissance. When a flock of birds is feeding it is common for one bird to perch on a high place to keep guard over the flock. In the same way, when a flock is asleep, often, one bird will remain awake. It is also common for large flocks to send one or two birds ahead of them when they are flying to a new area. The look-out birds can spy the lie of the land to find food, water and good places to perch. Mixed feeding flocks occur, and can help to spot predators.\n\nFlightless birds \nSome birds do not fly. Flightlessness in birds has evolved many times.\nThese include running birds like ostriches and emus and ocean-living birds, the large penguin family. Birds on islands have usually lost the power of flight. This is to their advantage because birds with the power of flight can be blown off their island during a storm. The same ability which got them to the island may later take them away in a storm.\n\nOstriches and emus do not need to fly because although they feed and nest on the ground, their great size and their speed is their protection. Some other ground-feeding birds have not been so lucky. Some birds such as the dodo and the kiwi were ground-feeding birds that lived in safety on islands where there was nothing dangerous to eat them. They lost the power of flight. Kiwis are endangered because European settlement to New Zealand brought animals like cats, dogs and rats which kill kiwis and eat their eggs. However, kiwis and also the rare New Zealand ground parrot have survived. In the case of dodos, they were fat and disgusting in taste. All the same, they were killed and eaten by sailors until there was none left. Other flightless birds which have disappeared are the great auk and the moa.\n\nPenguins are a very successful group of birds. They are a clade. They spend half their time on land. Their wings are adapted to life in the sea and have become flippers which let them in swim fast. They catch fish at sea, where they are in danger from seals.\n\nDigestion \nModern birds do not have teeth, and many swallow their prey whole. Nevertheless, they must break up food before it is digested. First of all, along their throat (oesophagus) they have a crop. This stores food items before digestion. That way a bird can eat several items, and then fly off to a quiet spot to digest them. \n\nTheir stomach comes next, with two very different parts. One part is like a straight hollow rod (the proventriculus) which secretes mild hydrochloric acid and an enzyme to break down protein. The other part of the stomach is the gizzard. This is muscular, and grinds up the contents. In herbivorous birds the gizzard contains some gastroliths (small stones or pieces of grit). Bones of fish will mostly be dissolved by the stomach acid. The partly digested and ground-up food now goes to the intestine, where digestion is completed, and most contents are absorbed. Anything indigestible, for example remains of feathers, is regurgitated via the mouth, not the cloaca.\n\nThe system is effective, and carnivorous birds can swallow quite large prey. A blue heron can swallow a fish as large as a carp successfully. Raptors eat by holding the prey down with a foot, and tearing it apart with their beak.\n\nReproduction\n\nMating \nAlthough birds are warm-blooded creatures like mammals, they do not give birth to live young. They lay eggs as reptiles do, but the shell of a bird\'s egg is hard. The baby bird grows inside the egg, and after a few weeks hatches (breaks out of the egg).\n\nBirds in cold climates usually have a breeding season once a year in the spring. Migratory birds can have two springs and two mating seasons in a year. \n\nNinety-five per cent of bird species are socially monogamous. These birds pair for at least the length of the breeding season. In some cases this arrangement lasts until the death of one of the pair. Monogamy clearly helps if females need males\' help to raise a brood successfully. It has other practical advantages: the nest is never left without defence. Birds are generally small, and they have many potential enemies.\n\nSome birds mate for life, like married couples. These birds include pigeons, geese, and cranes. Other birds look for new partners each year. For birds that choose new mates, part of the breeding season is display. The male bird will do all sorts of things to attract females. These include singing, dancing, showing off the feathers and building a beautiful nest. Some male birds have splendid feathers for attracting females. The most famous is the peacock who can spread the feathers above his tail into a huge fan. \n\nOther mating systems do occur in some species. Polygyny, polyandry, polygamy, polygynandry, and promiscuity do happen. Polygamous breeding systems arise when females are able to raise broods without the help of males. Some species may use more than one system depending on the circumstances.\n\nNesting \nOnce the birds have found partners, they find a suitable place to lay eggs. The idea of what is a suitable place differs between species, but most build bird nests. The bird is driven by a hormone (estradiol E2) to prepare a place for the eggs to hatch. Birds\' nests may be up a tree, in a cliff or on the ground according to species. When filled with eggs they are almost always guarded by one of the pair. In fact it is virtually impossible for the eggs to survive if one of the parents dies.\n\nRobins will make a beautiful little round nest of woven grass and carefully line it with feathers, bits of fluff and other soft things. Swallows like to nest near other swallows. They make nests from little blobs of clay, often on a beam near the roof of a building where it is well sheltered. Many birds like a hollow tree to nest in. Eagle\'s nests are often just piles of dead wood on the top of the tallest tree or mountain. Scrub turkeys scratch together a huge pile of leaves that may be 10 metres across. Guillemots lay their eggs on rock shelves with no nest at all. Their eggs are shaped so that they roll around in circles and do not fall off cliffs. A cuckoo does not make its own nest. It lays its egg in the nest of another bird and leaves it for them to care for. The cuckoo eggs are camouflaged to look like the host\'s eggs.\n\nWhen the nest has been prepared, the birds mate so that the eggs are fertilised and the chicks will start growing. Unlike mammals, birds (and reptiles) only have one opening as the exit hole for body fluids, and for reproduction. The opening is called the cloaca. A female bird, called a hen, has two ovaries, of which the left one usually produces eggs.\n\nMost male birds have no sex organs that can be seen. But inside the male are two testes which produce sperm which is stored in the cloaca. Birds mate by rubbing their cloacas together, although with some birds, particularly large water birds, the male has a sort of a penis inside the cloaca.\n\nHatching \nOnce the hen has mated, she produces fertile eggs which have chicks growing inside them. She lays the eggs in the nest. There might be just one egg or a number of them, called a clutch. Emus might lay as many as fifteen huge dark green eggs in a clutch. After the eggs are laid, they are incubated, or kept warm so the chicks form inside. Most birds stay together for the whole nesting season, and one advantage is that the work is shared. Many birds take turns sitting on the eggs, so that each adult can feed.\n\nThis is not always the case. With emus, the male does all the sitting and all the baby-minding. With emperor penguins it is also the male that cares for the egg. There is only one egg, which he keeps on his feet and under his feathers, standing in a big group of males without feeding until the chick is hatched. While the eggs are hatching, the females are at sea, feeding, so that they can care for the chicks when they return.\n\nSome birds put the eggs inside or on top of the mound of leaves and twigs. The mound acts like a compost heap. The decomposition of the rotting leaves causes the temperature to rise. This is heat released by the chemical action of bacterial and fungal respiration. It is the same reaction as that which keeps mammals and birds at a high temperature. The parents leave the mound. When the chicks hatch, they are able to feed themselves.\n\nMany small birds take 2–4 weeks to hatch eggs. Albatrosses take 80 days. During this time the female loses a lot of her body weight.\n\nThe quickest hatching time is for the cuckoo. Some types of cuckoos take only 10 days. This means that when they hatch in the nest of their \'\'foster parents\'\', the eggs that the parents have laid are not yet ready. Newborn cuckoos are naked, blind and ugly, but they are strong. They get under any eggs that are in the nest and throw them out before they hatch. That means that the cuckoo has the whole care of both parents. Baby cuckoos grow fast and often get bigger than the parents who feed them.\n\nWhen baby birds hatch, in most types of birds, they are fed by both parents, and sometimes by older aunties as well. Their mouths are open all the time and are often very brightly coloured, which acts as a releaser\'\', a trigger which stimulates the parent to feed them. For birds that eat grain and fruit, the parents eat and partly digest the food for the babies. It is then vomited carefully into the baby\'s mouth.\n  \n\n Families \nMany birds, particularly those that mate for life, are very sociable and keep together in a family group which might be anything from 4 or 6 adult birds and their young to a very large flock.\n\nAs chicks grow they change the fluffy down that covers them as babies for real feathers. At this stage they are called fledglings. Other family members may help care for fledgling chicks, feeding them and protecting them from attack while parents are feeding. When the fledglings have their new feathers, they come out of the nest to learn to fly. In some types of birds, like pigeons, the parents watch over this and as the young ones get stronger, will give them flying lessons, teaching them how to glide, how to fly in spirals and how to land like an expert.\n\n Communication \nMost birds are social animals, at least part of the time. They communicate to each other using sounds and displays.\n\nAlmost all birds make sounds to communicate. The types of noises that vary greatly. Some birds can sing, and  they are called songbirds or passerines. Examples are robins, larks, canaries, thrushes, nightingales. Corvids are passerines, but they do not sing. Birds that are not songbirds include: pigeons, seagulls, eagles, owls and ducks. Parrots are not songbirds, even though they can be taught to sing human songs.\n\n Songbirds \nAll birds make noises (\'\'bird vocalisation\'\'), but not all sing. Songbirds are passerines, many of which have beautiful melodic songs. Songs have different functions. Danger cries are different from territorial songs and mating calls are a third type. Fledgling may also have different calls from adults. Recognition calls for partners are quite common.\n\nAs to where the song comes from, there are three kinds of species:\nThose where the song is mainly inherited, and the bird always sings the same song in the same situations. The capacity is inherited, and only details are learnt from its neighbours.\nThose where the song is partly inherited, but the bird tunes it in by copying others. In this case the slight differences between the calls of different birds may be used by partners for identification.\nThose where the song is entirely learnt, and the bird often copies sounds from its environment. Only the capacity to sing is inherited.\n\nMost singing birds that are kept as pets, like canaries, have several tunes and some variations.\n\nThe same species of bird will sing different songs in different regions. A good example of this is the currawong. This is an Australia bird which is like a black and white crow. In the autumn, families get together in large flocks and do a lot of singing. Currawongs from some areas sing much more complex songs than others. Generally, currawongs from the Blue Mountains are the finest singers. The song of the currawong can be sung as a solo, but is often performed as a choir. One bird will take the lead and sing "Warble-warble-warble-warble!" All the other birds will join in and sing "Wooooooo!". When all the birds know the song, the choir will sing the "Warble" part and the soloist will sing the "Woo!". The song changes from year to year and from place to place.\n\n Lorenz\'s studies \nThe Austrian naturalist Konrad Lorenz studied the way in which birds communicate, or talk to each other. He found that each type of bird had a number of sounds which they made automatically, when ever they felt a certain way. Every sound had an action that went with it. So, if the bird was frightened, it acted frightened and made a frightened sound. This told the other birds around it that something frightening was happening.\n\nIf a flock of birds were flying over a field, they would be calling "Fly! Fly!" But a hungry bird, seeing something good to eat down below might start calling "Food! Food!" If other birds were also hungry, they would make the same call until more birds were calling "Food! Food!" than "Fly! Fly!". At this point, the mind of the flock would be changed. Some of the birds would start to yell "Fly downwards! Fly downwards!" as they sank from the sky, until the whole flock was all noisily calling the same thing.\n\nThese communication sounds are often short hard sounds like: chirps, squeaks, squawks and twitters. Sometimes the calls are longer and more musical. They include the "Rookety-coo" sound of a pigeon and the "Cockadoodledoo!" of a rooster. The bird cannot change these sounds. They always make them in the same way. The bird is locked into making each sound every time a particular idea comes into its head. The connection between how they feel and how they call is innate: they are born with it. Some calls in some species are learnt. Then, it is the tendency to learn which is inherited.\n\n The Jackdaw of Altenberg \nKonrad Lorenz noticed that when birds sing, they often use a lot of their regular calls as part of the song. Lorenz had a flock of jackdaws which were scattered during World War II. One day, an old bird returned. For many months she sat on the chimney singing her song, but in the song she kept making the call which Lorenz knew meant "Come home! Come home!" One day, to the great surprise of Lorenz, a male bird flew from a passing flock and joined her on the chimney. Lorenz was sure that it was her long-lost "husband" who had found his way home at last.\n\n Evolution and taxonomy \n\nPalaeontologists have found some exceptional places (lagerstätten) where fossils of early birds are found. The preservation is so good that on the best examples impressions of their feathers can be seen, and sometimes even the remains of meals they have eaten. From these remains we know that birds evolved from small carnivorous dinosaurs (theropods) in the Jurassic period. They radiated into a huge variety in the Lower Cretaceous. At the same time, their direct competitors, the pterosaurs, dwindled in numbers and variety, and became extinct at the end of the Mesozoic.\n\nBirds are classified by taxonomists as \'Aves\' (Avialae). Birds are the only living descendants of dinosaurs (strictly speaking, they are dinosaurs). Birds and Crocodilia are the only living members of the once-dominant Archosaur reptiles.\n\n Definition \nThe class Aves is was defined (1990) as all the descendants of the most recent common ancestor of modern birds and Archaeopteryx lithographica. But Archaeopteryx is almost certainly not the ancestor of modern birds. The transition to flight happened a number of times. The researchers offered four definitions. Birds can be: \nAll archosaurs closer to birds than crocodiles (Avemetatarsalia).\nAdvanced archosaurs with feathers (Avofilopluma).\nThose feathered dinosaurs that fly (or Avialae)\nAves can mean the last common ancestor of all living birds and all of its descendants (a "crown group", in this sense synonymous with Neornithes).\n\n The first bird-like creatures Archaeopteryx, from the Upper Jurassic some 150–145 million years ago (mya), was for a long time the earliest known bird which could fly. It is famous, because it was one of the first important fossils found after Charles Darwin published his ideas about evolution in the 19th century. By modern standards, Archaeopteryx could not fly very well. Other early fossil birds are, for example, Confuciusornis, Anchiornis huxlei and other Paraves.\n\nMany fossils of early birds and small dinosaurs have been discovered in the Liaoning Province of Northeast China. These include Anchiornis huxlei, from about 160 mya. The fossils show that most small theropod dinosaurs had feathers. These deposits have preserved them so well that the impressions of their feathers can be clearly seen. This leads us to think that feathers evolved first as heat insulation and only later for flight. The origin of birds lies in these small feathered dinosaurs.\n\nPalaeontologists now agree that birds are included in Maniraptora group of dinosaurs. This explains why we say that birds are living dinosaurs.\n\n Evolution of modern birds \nA leading authority says "Most living birds have fossil representatives in the Cenozoic"... "Key problems remain in understanding bird phylogeny... we seem to understand as little about the relationships among living birds as among Cretaceous birds".\n\n Origin of birds\n Paraves\n\nBirds and people \n\nSome birds are eaten as food. Most usually it is the chicken and its eggs, but people often also eat geese, pheasants, turkeys and ducks. Other birds are sometimes eaten are: emus, ostriches, pigeons, grouse, quails, doves, woodcocks and even songbirds. Some species have died out because they have been hunted for food, for example the dodo and the passenger pigeon.\n\nMany species have learned how to get food from people. The number of birds of these species has grown because of it. Seagulls and crows find food from garbage dumps. The feral pigeon (Columba livia), sparrows (Passer domesticus and starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) live in large numbers in towns and cities all over the world.\n\nSometimes people also use working birds. For example, homing pigeons carry messages. Nowadays people sometimes race them for sport. People also use falcons for hunting, and cormorants for fishing. In the past, people in mines often used a canary to see if there were bad gas methane in the air.\n\nPeople often have colorful birds such as parrots and mynahs as pets. These intelligent birds are popular because they can copy human talking. Because of this, some people trap birds and take them to other countries to sell. This is not usually allowed these days. Most pet birds are specially bred and are sold in pet shops.\n\nPeople can catch some bird diseases, for example: psittacosis, salmonellosis, campylobacteriosis, Newcastle\'s disease, mycobacteriosis, influenza, giardiasis and cryptosporiadiosis. In 2005, there was an epidemic of bird influenza spreading through some parts of the world, often called avian flu.\n\nSome people have birdboxes in their gardens to give birds a place to nest and bird tables where birds can get food and water in very cold or very dry weather. This lets people see some small birds close up which are normally hidden away in bushes and trees.\n\nBird orders \nThe following is a listing of all bird orders:\n Infraclass Palaeognathae\n Superorder Struthionimorphae\n Struthioniformes\n Superorder Notopalaeognathae\n Rheiformes\n Tinamiformes\n Casuariiformes\n Apterygiformes\n Infraclass Neognathae\n Superorder Galloanserae\n Galliformes\n Anseriformes\n Superorder Neoaves\n Phoenicopteriformes\n Podicipediformes\n Columbiformes\n Mesitornithiformes\n Pteroclidiformes\n Apodiformes\n Caprimulgiformes\n Cuculiformes\n Otidiformes\n Musophagiformes\n Opisthocomiformes\n Gruiformes\n Charadriiformes\n Gaviiformes\n Procellariiformes\n Sphenisciformes\n Ciconiiformes\n Suliformes\n Pelecaniformes\n Eurypygiformes\n Phaethontiformes\n Cathartiformes\n Accipitriformes\n Strigiformes\n Coliiformes\n Leptosomiformes\n Trogoniformes\n Bucerotiformes\n Coraciiformes\n Piciformes\n Cariamiformes\n Falconiformes\n Psittaciformes\n Passeriformes\n\nBird population decreasing\nA report produced by BirdLife International every five years measures the population of birds worldwide.

It includes the time from prehistory to the present day.  It is different from natural history.\n\nDevelopment of the human species \n\nModern human beings are called Homo sapiens (\'wise man\'). They have existed for about 250,000 years. Biologists believe that Homo sapiens evolved in Africa.\n\nHomo sapiens, lived at the same time as  other species of human. These included Homo erectus (\'standing man\') and Homo neanderthalensis (\'man from Neanderthal\'). The theory of human evolution says that modern humans, Neanderthals, and Homo erectus slowly developed from other earlier species of human-like creatures.\n\nHomo neanderthalensis are the first humans scientists discovered which were not Homo sapiens. Homo neanderthalensis are usually called Neanderthal Man. They were discovered when the cranium of a skull was found in the Neanderthal Valley in 1856. It was different from a modern human skull so scientists believed it was from a new species. Entire Neanderthal skeletons have been found in other places since then. When ancient stone tools are found, their style often shows whether they were made by Homo sapiens or Neanderthals (see Palaeolithic). Neanderthals existed before modern humans. They knew how to use tools and fire.\n\nScientists believe that Homo sapiens spread from Africa to all other parts of the world, replacing Homo neanderthalensis in Europe and Homo erectus in Asia. By the end of the Stone Age, it is believed that Homo sapiens were the only type of humans left.\n\nInfluence of climate \n\nClimate is the normal weather in a place. It changes from one part of the world to another. Some areas are hot all year, and some are cold all year. Some areas are dry all year, and others are wet all year. Most areas have climates that are warmer in the summer and cooler in the winter.  Most parts of the world get rain at some times of the year and do not get rain at other times of the year. Some parts of the world have oceanic climates and others have alpine climates.\n\nClimate affects what food people eat. This is because climate affects what foods can grow.  If one food is easier to grow, people usually eat that food more often than other foods. Foods that people eat more of than other foods are called staple foods.  Staple foods are usually grains or vegetables because they are easy to grow.  Wheat, maize, millet, rice, oats, rye, potatoes, yams, breadfruit and beans are examples of different staple foods from around the world.\n\nClimate can affect the way people live in many other ways. It affects the types of animals that can live in any area, which affect the types of meats that are available to eat.\nClimate also affects the buildings that people make, the clothes that they wear and the way that they travel.\n\nClimate change \n\nThe climate on earth has not stayed the same through human history. There are long periods of time when it is generally warmer, and there are long periods of time when it is generally colder. When it is generally colder, there is more ice on the poles of the planet. A cold period is called an ice age. There have been many ice ages in the history of the earth. Two have affected humans.\n\nFrom 70,000 to around 10,000 years ago there was a big ice age which affected humans and the way that they lived. Between 1600\xa0AD and 1900\xa0AD there was a period called the Little Ice Age when the climate was a little bit colder than usual.\n\nPrehistory \n\nThe word "Prehistory" means "before history".  It is used for the long period of time before humans began to write about their lives.  This time is divided into two main ages: the Paleolithic Age (or Early Stone Age) and the Neolithic Age  (or late Stone Age).  The two ages did not start and end at the same time everywhere.  A place moved from one age to another depending on when people changed their technology.\n\nThe end of prehistory varies from one place to another. It depends on the date when that place began to use writing. In Egypt the first written documents date from around 3200\xa0BC. In Australia the first written records date from 1788 and in New Guinea from about 1900.\n\nPaleolithic Era \n\nThe Paleolithic Era is by far the longest age of humanity\'s time, about 99% of human history. The Paleolithic Age started about 2.6  million years ago and ended around 10,000\xa0BC. The age began when hominids (early humans) started to use stones as tools for bashing, cutting and scraping. The age ended when humans began to plant crops and have other types of agriculture. In some areas, such as Western Europe, the way that people lived was affected by the Ice age. In these places, people moved towards agriculture quicker than in warmer places where there was always lots of food to gather. Their culture is sometimes called the Mesolithic Era (Middle Stone Age).\n\nDuring the Paleolithic Era humans grouped together in small bands. They lived by gathering plants and hunting wild animals. This way of living is called a "hunter-gatherer society".  People hunted small burrowing animals like rabbits, as well as birds and herds of animals like deer and cattle.  They also gathered plants to eat, including grains. Grain often grows on grasslands where herds of grass-eating animals are found.  People also gathered root vegetables, green vegetables, beans, fruit, seeds, berries, nuts, eggs, insects and small reptiles.\n\nMany Paleolithic bands were nomadic. They moved from place to place as the weather changed. They followed herds of animals that they hunted from their winter feeding places to their summer feeding places. If there was a drought,flood, or some other disaster, the herds and the people might haved moved a long distance, looking for food.  During the "Ice Age" a lot of the water on Earth turned to ice.  This made sea much lower than it is now.  People were able to walk through Beringia from Siberia to Alaska.  Bands of Homo sapiens ( another word for people) travelled to that area from Asia. At that time there were rich grasslands with many large animals that are now extinct. It is believed that many groups of people travelled there over a long time and later spread to other parts of America, as the weather changed.\n\nPaleolithic people used stone tools. Sometimes a stone tool was just a rock. It might have been useful for smashing a shell or an animal\'s skull, or for grinding grain on another rock. Other tools were made by breaking rocks to make a sharp edge. The next development in stone tool making was to chip all the edges of a rock so that it made a pointed shape, useful for a spearhead, or arrow tip. Some stone tools are carefully "flaked" at the edges to make them sharp, and symmetrically shaped. Paleolithic people also used tools of wood and bone. They probably also used leather and vegetable fibers but these have not lasted from that time. Paleolithic people also knew how to make fire which they used for warmth and cooking.\n\nThe Neolithic\n\nSettling down \n\nIn the Paleolithic Era there were many different human species. According to current research, only the modern human reached the Neolithic Era.\n\nThe Neolithic era was marked by changes in society. During the Neolithic era, people started to settle down. They developed agriculture and domesticated animals, both of which took a very long time. Because of these two things, people did not have to migrate as much any more. Villages could grow to much larger sizes than before. Over time, villages fought and spread their control over larger areas and some became civilisations. During this time, humankind also developed further intellectually, militarily and spiritually.\n\nWhen humans started to grow crops and domesticate certain animals such as dogs, goats, sheep, and cattle;  their societies changed. Because people now grew crops and raised livestock, they started to stay in the same place and build permanent settlements. In most places, this happened between 10,000 and 12,000 years ago. Their diet also changed. People ate more cereals and vegetables. They started to keep extra foods and seeds for later. In some years there were surpluses (extras) that could be traded for other goods.\n\nThese changes happened independently in many parts of the world. They did not happen in the same order though. For example, the earliest farming societies in the Near East did not use pottery. No one is sure if Britain had agriculture, or if permanent villages existed there at all. Early Japanese societies used pottery before developing agriculture.\n\nVere Gordon Childe gave the name Neolithic Revolution to this process in the 1920s. He thought that it was as important as the Industrial Revolution (which happened in the 18th and 19th century).\n\nAncient history – the early civilizations \n\nAncient history was the time from the development of writing to the fall of the Roman Empire. The fall of the Roman Empire caused chaos in Europe, leading to the Middle Ages (also called the Dark Ages or the Age of Faith).\n\nThe first civilizations were built along major river systems. These civilizations are called river valley civilizations. River valley civilizations were the most powerful civilizations in this time period because water was needed to have an agricultural society.\n\nThese civilizations were similar in that:\n They developed along river systems\n They had polytheistic religions\n They used writing systems\n\nMiddle East and North Africa\n\nSumer \n\nSumer was the world\'s first known ancient civilization. The Sumerians took over the fertile crescent region of Mesopotamia around 3300 BCE. They grew crops on the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. By 3000 BCE, many cities had been built in parts of Sumerian Mesopotamia. They formed independently and each had their own government. They were called city-states and often fought with each other.\n\nA surplus in food led to a Division of labour. This means that some people were able to stop growing crops and do other jobs, since enough crops were already grown. This brought a split in society. Today, such a split is called social pyramid. In a social pyramid, people are grouped into social classes based on their wealth and power. In Sumer, the king, priests, and government officials were at the top of the social pyramid. Below them were the artisans, merchants, farmers, and fishers. At the bottom of the pyramid were slaves. Slaves were often prisoners of war, criminals, or people working to pay off debt.\n\nThe Sumerians created the world\'s first system of writing; it was called cuneiform. The oldest versions of one of the world\'s first literary works, the Epic of Gilgamesh, go back to this time. In Sumer, only the sons of the rich and powerful learned how to read and write. They went to a school called edubba. Only the boys who went to edubba could become scribes.\n\nThe Sumerians also invented sun-dried bricks, the wheel, the ox plow, and were skilled at making pottery. They are also thought to have invented the sailboat.\n\nAfter the Sumerians, the civilizations of Babylonia and then Assyria rose to power in Mesopotamia.\n\nBabylonia had a king named Hammurabi. He is famous for the Codex Hammurabi.\n\nJust to the east was the long-lasting civilization of Elam.\n\nAncient Egypt \n\nAncient Egypt grew along the Nile river. It was created around 3500\xa0BC. It was most powerful in the second millennium BC. When it was its biggest, it went all the way from the Nile delta to a mountain called Jebel Barkal in Sudan. It probably ended at about 30\xa0BC when the country was invaded by the Roman Empire.\n\nThe society of ancient Egypt depended on a balance of natural and human resources, especially the irrigation of the Nile Valley so that Egyptians could grow crops.\n\nThere was a great difference between classes in this society. Most of the people were farmers but they did not own the agricultural products they produced. These were property of the state, temple, or noble family that owned the land. There was slavery, but it is not clear how it was practiced.\nThe Religion of Ancient Egypt encouraged people to respect their rulers and their past.\n\nThe Egyptians are known for writing in hieroglyphs, building the famous pyramids, and building other sorts of tombs and big temples and for their military.\n\nThe religion of Judaism formed about 1500 BCE around the Egyptian and Babylonian civilizations.\n\nMid and Eastern Asia\n\nAncient China \n\nChina began as city-states in the Yellow River valley. The Shang Dynasty (商朝) was the first dynasty of Ancient China.Turtle shells with writing on them have been carbon dated to about 1500\xa0BC.\n\nThe Zhou Dynasty came after the Shang Dynasty. Kong Fuzi and Laozi lived at the end of the Zhou Dynasty. They were the greatest Chinese philosophers. They founded new philosophies, or ways of thinking. Confucius founded Confucianism and Laozi founded Daoism.\n\nAfter the Zhou Dynasty came the Warring States Period.\n\nThe Qin (秦) dynasty came after the Warring States Period. The Qin emperor Qin Shi Huang created the first centralized state in China in 221\xa0BC. It was based on his based on his political philosophy of legalism. He made everyone write the same way. He fought against Confucianism. He also started building what would later become the Great Wall.\n\nIn 202\xa0BC the Han Dynasty took over. It was about as strong as the Roman Empire. Towards the end of the Han Dynasty,  Buddhism became influential in China.\n\nAncient India/Pakistan \n\nThe Indus Valley Civilization lasted from about 2600\xa0BC to 1900\xa0BC. It was the first urban civilization on the subcontinent. It was centered on the Indus River and its tributaries. The civilization is famous for its brick cities that had road-side drainage systems and multi-storied houses.\n\nThe Maurya dynasty started in 321 BCE. This was the first time most of the Indian subcontinent was united under a single government. Ashoka the Great was a famous Mauryan emperor. When he started ruling, he sought to expand his empire, but then followed a policy of ahimsa (non-violence) after converting to Buddhism. He wrote about this in the Edicts of Ashoka. The Edicts of Ashoka are the oldest historical documents from India that still exist. While Ashoka ruled, Buddhist ideals spread across all of East Asia and South-East Asia.\n\nThe Gupta dynasty ruled from around 320 to 550\xa0AD. The Gupta Empire included only Central India, and the area east of current day Bangladesh. This empire never included present-day Pakistan to the west. Gupta society was ordered in accordance with Hindu beliefs. Historians place the Gupta dynasty alongside with the Han Dynasty, Tang Dynasty and Roman Empire as a model of a classical civilization.\n\nThe Americas\n\nAncient Maya \n\nThe Maya civilization is a civilization that started in Central America. They lived mostly on the Yucatán Peninsula in what is now known as Mexico, but also Honduras, Belize and Guatemala. They were the only known civilization of pre-Columbian America to have a fully developed written language. They also made great achievements in art and architecture and had a very advanced system of mathematics and astronomy.\n\nThe area where the Maya civilization developed was inhabited from around the 10th millennium BC. The first Maya settlements were built there in about 1800\xa0BC, in the Soconusco region. This is in the modern-day state of Chiapas in Mexico, on the Pacific Ocean. Today, this is called the Early Preclassic period. At the time, humans began to settle down permanently. They started to grow livestock. Pottery and small clay figures were made. They constructed simple burial mounds. Later they developed these mounds into step pyramids. There were other civilizations around, especially in the north, such as the Olmec, the Mixe-Zoque, and Zapotec civilizations. These people mostly lived in the area of the modern-day state Oaxaca. The exact borders of the Maya empire in the north are unclear. There were probably areas where Maya culture overlapped with other cultures. Many of the earliest significant inscriptions and buildings appeared in this overlapping zone. These cultures and the Maya probably influenced one another.\n\nAustralia \nThere has been a long history of contact between Papuan peoples of the Papua New Guinea and the Aboriginal people. Aboriginal people seem to have lived a long time in the same environment as the now extinct Australian megafauna. Stories about that are told in the oral culture of many Aboriginal groups.\n\nAncient Europe\n\nHallstatt culture \n\nThe Hallstatt era is named after the city Hallstatt in Austria, where the first artifacts were found. It lasted from about 1200\xa0BC to about 275\xa0BC. There were different periods, which today are mainly told apart by the kinds of brooches used at the time. These brooches changed rather rapidly, and can therefore give us good guesses at to what time they came from. Hallstatt culture sites have been found in the east of France, in Switzerland, in the south of Germany, in Austria, in Slovenia and Croatia, northwestern Hungary, southwestern Slovakia and southern Moravia. The culture can be divided into an eastern and a western one quite easily; the dividing line runs through the Czech Republic, and Austria, between longitudes 14 and 15 degrees east.\n\nIn this time, the social structure developed into a hierarchy. This can be documented by various things that were added to graves. In the Bronze Age, people used to live in big settlements. As iron became available, trade routes changed. A new richer class evolved. Unlike before, these richer class people liked to live in big houses in the countryside, as a demonstration of their wealth. Funerals also changed, from cremation burials, to burials with stone coffins. The new upper class used their wealth for import goods, mostly from the Mediterranean.\n\nLa Tène culture \n\nThe La Tène culture is a culture that lasted from about 500\xa0BC to about 100\xa0AD. It is named after the city of La Tène (today, Marin-Epagnier, next to Neuchâtel). It was influenced a lot by the Roman and Greek cultures. There are two sources for this:\n Objects found there\n Romans and Greeks came in contact with the culture. They called them Celts, usually. They wrote about them. The most important work about them was written by Julius Caesar. It is called On the Gallic War (De bello gallico).\n\nThe Celts basically lived in clans. Each clan was headed by a leader, which came from the  Druids or the Bards. Women were much better off than with the Romans, they were almost equal to men. There was polygamy and polyandry (A man could have several women, a woman could have several men).\n\nIllyria \n\nIllyria  is the part of west-south Balkan Peninsula populated by Illyrians whose descendants are Albanians.\nIllyrians lived in tribunes such as Epirus, Dardania, Taulantia etc.\nThey had their own language, the Illyrian language that was different from the Greek language and Latin.\nAt the year 1000\xa0BC the population of Illyria is estimated to be around 500,000.\n\nAncient Greece \n\nWhat is known today as Ancient Greece is a very important period in history. Most people agree that it came after the Minoan and Mycenaean civilizations. It ended when the Romans invaded Greece, in 146\xa0BC. Greek culture had a very powerful influence on later civilizations, especially the Romans. The Greeks developed what is now called a city-state, or a polis. There were many polises. Some of the more important ones were Athens, Sparta, Corinth and Thebes. The word politics comes from there. It literally means: things that are about the polis. Greek cities did not have much contact with each other, because of the mountains and many islands Greece is made up of. When a city no longer had enough food to care for all its citizens, some people were sent out to set up a new city. This was called a colony. Each city was independent, and ruled by someone within that city. Colonies also looked to the city where they originally came from for guidance.\n\nWhen Greece went to war (for example against the Persian Empire), there was an alliance of such city states, against the Persians. There were also many wars between different city states.\n\nThere were many artists and philosophers who lived in that period. Most of them are still important for philosophy today. A well-known artist was Homer. He wrote epics about the war against the Trojans, and the early history of Greece. Other well-known artists were Aristophanes and Sappho. Well-known philosophers include Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. A well known mathematician of the time was Euclid. Statesmen of the time were Pericles and Alexander the Great.\n\nAncient Rome \n\nAncient Rome was a civilization that started in modern-day Italy, in the 8th Century before Christ. The civilization lasted for 12 centuries. It ended, when Mehmed II conquered Constantinople, on May 29, 1453. According to legend, the Roman civilization was founded by Romulus and Remus, in the year 753\xa0BC. The Roman Empire developed in wars against Carthage and the Seleucid Empire. Julius Caesar conquered Gaul, modern France, and Augustus ended the Roman republic by becoming emperor. At its biggest extent, the empire covered all of the Mediterranean. Rome became so big, because it led war against other nations and then assimilated their culture.\n\nSplit of the Empire into East and West \nIn 293, Diocletian organized a separate administration of the western and the eastern part of the empire. The capital of the western part was Rome, the capital of the eastern part was Constantinople. Constantine I was the first to stop discrimination against Christians (313). Christianity became state religion under the reign of Theodosius I.\n\nThe western part of the empire had many problems with barbarians. In the 5th century, the Huns migrated westwards. This meant that the Visigoths moved into the empire, to seek protection. Rome was sacked by barbarians multiple times. On September 4, 476, the Germanic chief Odoacer forced the last Roman emperor in the west, Romulus Augustus, to quit. After about 1200 years, the rule of Rome in the West came to an end.\n\nThe eastern part had similar problems. Justinian I managed to conquer parts of North Africa and Italy. Shortly after he died, all that was left were parts of Southern Italy, and Sicily. In the east, the empire was threatened by the Sassanid Empire.\n\nNew departures and continuity \nAfter the fall of Western Rome, the Germanic tribes that took over tried to learn from Roman civilization, but much was forgotten and up to the Renaissance not many achievements happened in Europe. But with the rise of Islam, many changes happened during the Islamic Golden Age. The Greek and Roman traditions were kept and further development took place. The Chinese civilization had a Golden Age during the Tang period, when their capital was the biggest in the world. During the Renaissance, Europe developed and made great advancements in many areas as well.\n\nAsia\n\nMiddle East – Islamic rise, Byzantine decline \n\nIn Arabia, Muhammad founded Islam in 632.  His followers rapidly conquered territories in Syria and Egypt.  They soon were a danger to the Byzantine Empire.  In the 8th and 9th centuries, the Byzantine Empire stopped Islamic expansion and reconquered some lost territories.  In 1000 A.D. the eastern Empire was at its height: Basileios II reconquered Bulgaria and Armenia.  Culture and trade flourished.  In 1071 the Battle of Manzikert led the empire into a dramatic decline.  For the Byzantine Empire this meant centuries of civil wars and Turkic invasions.  The Muslim caliphate had an Golden Age under the Abbasids.\n\nTheir power forced Emperor Alexius I Comnenus of the Byzantine Empire to send a call for help to the West in 1095.  The West sent the Crusades.  These eventually led to the Sack of Constantinople in the Fourth Crusade in 1204.  Because of this, what was left of the Empire broke into successor states.  The winner of these disputes was that of Nicaea.  After Constantinople was again conquered by imperial forces, the empire was little more than a Greek state on the Aegean coast.  The Eastern Empire came to an end when Mehmed II conquered Constantinople on May 29, 1453.  The Ottoman Empire took its place and from 1400 to 1600 was the most powerful empire in the Middle East and ruled at the southern and eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nChina \nThe Tang Dynasty (618–907), with its capital at Chang\'an (today Xi\'an), was the biggest city in the world at the time and is considered by historians as a high point in Chinese civilization as well as a golden age of cosmopolitan culture. The Ming Dynasty ruled from 1368 to 1644. The Ming built a vast army and navy.\n\nIndia \nFrom around the 6th–7th century. In South India, Chola kings ruled Tamil Nadu, and Chera kings ruled Kerala. They had trading relationships with the Roman Empire to the west and Southeast Asia to the east. In north India, Rajputs ruled in many kingdoms.\n\nIn 1336, two brothers named Harihara I and Bukka founded the Vijayanagara Empire in an area which is now in the Karnataka state of India. The most famous king of this empire was Krishnadevaraya. In 1565, rulers of this empire were defeated in a battle. But the empire continued for about the next one hundred years.\nNorthern India was ruled by Islamic sultans.\n\nJapan \nThe Heian Period in Japan is famous for its art, poetry and literature. The writing system, Kana, was developed. It was followed by the feudal period (1185–1853) during which samurai and daimyos were the leading figures and the shogun the real monarch whereas the tennō had only a role as religious head. Between the years 1272 and 1281 the Mongols tried to invade but were driven out by the Japanese.\nIn 1542, a Portuguese ship reached Japan. Japanese learned about guns and firearms from them.\n\nMongols \nGenghis Khan in 1209 brought together the Mongol tribes and founded the Mongol Empire, one of the largest land empires in history. Later Kublai Khan would go on to expand the empire and found the Mongol-ruled Yuan Dynasty of China. The empire later broke into several empires, all of which were later destroyed.\n\nEuropean Middle Ages \n\nThe Middle Ages was the time from the fall of the Roman empire until the middle of the 15th century. From 500 to about 800 there was some decline compared with the Roman civilization. European villages were often destroyed and looted by barbarians such as the Vikings. During the High Middle Ages magnificent castles and large churches called cathedrals were built and important works of literature were written. In the later Middle Ages, there was a plague called the Black Death. The Black Death killed one-third to one-half of Europe\'s population.\n\nA system called feudalism was a very important part of the Middle Ages. In this system, the king was at the top of the social pyramid. The king gave land to the lord in exchange for loyalty. The lords were the next in the pyramid. The lords gave land (called a fief) to knights in exchange for loyalty and protection. The knights came next in the pyramid. Peasants were not part of the feudal system because they did not give or receive land. They worked on a lord\'s manor in exchange for protection.\n\nThe Crusades were also fought during the Middle Ages. There is a theory that says the Crusades helped end the Middle Ages along with the Black Death, increased trade and better farming technology.\n\nRenaissance \n\nThe Renaissance started in Italy. Renaissance is a French word meaning "rebirth". The Renaissance meant that people learned from the ancient Greek and Roman or "classical" cultures that had been forgotten for some time. Artists learned from classical paintings and sculptures. So they reinvented perspective and the art of free standing realistic sculptures that had been characteristic in Greek and Roman art. Some famous Renaissance artists are Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael. The Gutenberg printing press, invented by Johannes Gutenberg, was also developed during this time.\n\nThe Renaissance was also a time of great achievements in science (Galileo Galilei, Francis Bacon), philosophy (Thomas More) and literature (Dante Alighieri, William Shakespeare).\n\nAmerica\n\nMaya civilization (classical period) \n\nWhat is known as the classical period lasted from about 250 to about 900. During this time, many monuments were constructed. There are also many big inscriptions from then. In this period, the Maya moved to building large cities. This is known as urbanism. Many important intellectual and artistic developments happened in an area that is known as the southern lowlands.\n\nLike the Ancient Greek, the Maya civilization was made of many independent city-states. Agriculture was important around these city states like Tikal and Copán.\nThe most important monuments are the pyramids they built in their religious centers and the palaces of their rulers. The palace at Cancuén is the largest in the Maya area. There are no pyramids in the area of the palace. Other important things the archaeologists found include the carved stone slabs usually called stelae (the Maya called them tetun, or "tree-stones"). These slabs show rulers along with hieroglyphic texts describing their genealogy, military victories, and other accomplishments. In North America, they made Mississipian culture with the largest land field from around 800 CE to 1600.\n\nTrade with other civilizations \nThe Maya also had trade routes that ran over long distances. They traded with many of the other Mesoamerican cultures, such as Teotihuacan, the Zapotec, and other groups in central and gulf-coast Mexico. They also traded with non-Mesoamerican groups, that were farther away. Archaeologists have found gold from Panama in the Sacred Cenote of Chichen Itza.\n\nImportant trade goods were cacao, salt, sea shells, jade and obsidian.\n\nSudden collapse \nIn the 8th and 9th century, the cities in the southern lowlands had problems, and declined. At the same time, the Maya stopped making big monuments and inscriptions. Shortly afterwards, these cities were abandoned. Currently, archaeologists are not sure why this happened. There are different theories. Either ecological factors played a role in this, or the cause of this abandonment was not related to the environment.\n\nPost-classical period and decline \n\nIn the north, development went on, form the 10th to about the 16th century. The influences from the outside left more traces in the Maya culture at that time. Some of the important sites in this era were Chichen Itza, Uxmal, and Coba. At some point, the ruling dynasties of Chichen and Uxmal declined. Afterwards, Mayapan ruled all of Yucatán until a revolt in 1450. The area then degenerated into competing city-states until the Yucatán was conquered by the Spanish.\n\nBy 1250, there developed other city-states. The Itza maintained their capital at Tayasal. It ruled over an area extending across the Peten Lakes region, including the community of Ekckixil on Lake Quexil. Postclassic Maya states also survived in the southern highlands. One of the Maya kingdoms in this area is responsible for the best-known Maya work of historiography and mythology, the Popol Vuh.\n\nThe Spanish started to conquer Maya lands. This took them much longer than with the Inca or Aztecs, because there was no capital city. This meant that when they had conquered one city, this had little influence on the whole empire. The last Maya states were finally subdued in 1697.\n\nThe Maya people did not disappear though. There are still about 6 million of them. Some are well-integrated, others continue speak one of the Maya languages and uphold their cultural heritage.\n\nThe Aztecs \n\nThe Aztecs built an empire in Central America, mainly in Mexico. The empire lasted from the 14th to the 16th century. They spoke the Nahuatl language. Their capital was Tenochtitlan. It was built on islands in a lake. Tenochtitlan was one of the greatest cities of the world in that time.\n\nThe Aztecs believed in polytheism. Quetzalcoatl (feathered snake), Huitzilopochtli (hummingbird of the south) and Tezcatlipoca (smoking mirror) were the most important Gods. Sometimes the Aztecs killed humans to please their gods. Between 1519 and 1521 the Spanish leader Hernán Cortés defeated the Aztecs and took their empire. Some Aztecs did not want to fight against the soldiers of Cortés, because they thought they were Gods.\n\nToday many Mexicans have Aztec and other Native American forefathers. People still use Aztec symbols in Mexico. On the Mexican flag there is a picture of an eagle on a cactus with a snake in its mouth. This was an Aztec symbol. Also the name Mexico is an Aztec word.\n\nThe Aztecs ate a lot of plants and vegetables that could be grown easily in the Mexico area. The main food that they ate was corn, which they called maize. Another food that they ate was squash.\n\nAztecs also had a lot of harsh punishments for certain crimes. For the following crimes the punishment was death: adultery, wearing cotton clothes (cotton clothes were only for the nobles), cutting down a living tree, moving a field boundary making your land bigger, making someone else\'s smaller, major theft and treason.\n\nThe Incas \n\nThe Incas were a civilized empire in western South America. The Incas are called a "pre-Columbian" empire. This means that their country was here before Christopher Columbus. They ruled parts of South America around what is now Peru for a little over 100 years, until the Spanish invasion in the 16th century.\n\nThe Incan empire or , meaning four regions in Quechua, only lasted for about 100 years as the arrival of the Spaniards in 1532 conquered them. Their main language was Quechua, but as the Incas were basically made up of many different groups there were probably many other different languages.\n\nTheir capital was in the city of Cusco, or Qosqo, in what is now southern Peru.\n\nManco Capac founded the first Inca state around 1200. It covered the area around Cusco. In the 1400s, Pachacuti began to absorb other people in the Andes. The expansion of the Inca Empire had started. The Inca Empire would become the biggest empire in the Americas before Columbus.\n\nIn 1532, the civil war ended. The brothers Huascar and Atahualpa, fought for who would succeed their father. During this time, the Spanish conquerors took possession of the Inca territory. They were led by Francisco Pizarro. In the following years the conquistadors managed to extend their power over the whole Andean region. They suppressed successive Inca rebellions until the establishment of the Viceroyalty of Perú in 1542 and the fall of the resistance of the last Incas of Vilcabamba in 1572. The Inca civilization ends at that time, but many cultural traditions remain in some ethnic groups as Quechuas and Aymara people.\n\nAfrica \n\nAncient Egypt and Carthage are well known civilizations of ancient Africa. But because there are not many written sources in large parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, the history of Africa is not easy to write about. But with new techniques such as the recording of oral history, historical linguistics and archeology knowledge has improved, not only for the empires and kingdoms of Ethiopia, Ghana, Mali, Nubia, Kush and Kerma.\n\nGlobalization\n\nFrom colonialization to imperialism\n\nThe rise of Europe\n\nColonization \n\nColonization happened after Christopher Columbus came to the Americas. European countries such as England, France, and Spain built colonies in the Americas. These settlers fought the Native Americans to take over their land. The colonisation of the Americas was the beginning of modern times.\n\nAn important part about contact with the Americas was the Columbian Exchange The Columbian Exchange brought new foods, ideas, and diseases to the Old World and New World, changing the way people lived. Historians believe that almost everyone as far as Asia was affected in some way by the Columbian Exchange.\n\nReformation and Counter-Reformation \nProtestant Reformation started with Martin Luther and the posting of the 95 theses on the door of the castle church in Wittenberg, Germany. At first he protested against corruption such as simony or the sale of indulgences. But then it became clear that he had different ideas about the church doctrine. He thought that Christians should only read the Bible to find out what God wants from them. That meant that they did not need priests (see: Five solas). The three most important traditions that came directly from the Protestant Reformation were the Lutheran, Reformed (Calvinist, Presbyterian, etc.), and Anglican traditions.\n\nThe Counter-Reformation, or Catholic Reformation, was the Catholic Church fighting the Protestant Reformation. New religious orders, such as the Jesuits were founded and missionaries sent around the world. Decisions were taken at the Council of Trent (1545–1563).\n\nIndustrial revolution \nThe Industrial Revolution started in Great Britain. It brought many advances in the way goods were produced. These advances allowed people to produce much more than they needed for living. The early British Empire split as its colonies in America revolted to establish a representative government.\n\nFrom nationalism to imperialism \nThe French Revolution lead to  massive political change in continental Europe, as people following the ideas of Enlightenment asked for human rights with the slogan liberté, egalité, fraternité (liberty, equality, fraternity). That led to the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, but also to terror and the execution of King Louis XVI. The French leader, Napoleon Bonaparte, conquered and changed Europe through war up to 1815. As more and more small property holders were granted the vote, in France and the UK, socialist and trade union activity developed and revolution gripped Europe in 1848. The last vestiges of serfdom were abolished in Austria-Hungary in 1848. Russian serfdom was abolished in 1861. The Balkan nations began to regain their independence from the Ottoman Empire. After the Franco-Prussian War, Italy and Germany became unified in 1870 and 1871. Conflict spread across the globe, in a chase for empires. The search for a "place in the sun" ended with the outbreak of World War I. In the desperation of war, the Russian Revolution promised the people "peace, bread and land". The defeat of Germany came at the price of economic destruction, which was written down in the Treaty of Versailles.\n\nAsia\n\nChina – continuity \nFrom 1644 to 1912 the Qing or Manchu Dynasty ruled China. The dynasty was founded by the Manchu clan in northeast China (Manchuria). It expanded into China proper and its surrounding territories, establishing the Empire of the Great Qing.\nIts military power weakened during the 1800s, and faced with international pressure, massive rebellions and defeats in wars, the Qing Dynasty declined after the mid-19th century. It was overthrown in 1912.\n\nJapan \nDuring the Edo period, Japan had many small rulers. There were about 200 of them, called the daimyo. Out of them, the Tokugawa clan was most powerful. They ruled from a place called Edo. This place was around the present day’s Tokyo. For fifteen generations they were the most powerful clan in Japan.\n\nBeginning from the early 17th century, the rulers (known as shogunate) started a policy of seclusion (stopping some people coming in), known as sakoku in Japanese language. They suspected that traders, merchants and missionaries wanted to bring Japan under the control of European powers. Except the Dutch and the Chinese, all foreigners, traders and merchants from other countries, missionaries were no longer allowed into Japan.\n\nStill even during the period of seclusion, Japanese continued to gain information and knowledge about other parts of the world.\nThis policy of seclusion lasted for about 200 years. It ended 1868 with Meiji Restoration, when the emperor took over again and started a lot of reforms.\n\nIndia – Mughal Empire \n\nThe Mughal Empire existed from 1526 to 1857. When it was biggest it ruled most of the Indian subcontinent, then known as Hindustan, and parts of what is now Afghanistan. It was founded by Babur in 1526 and ruled until 1530. Its most important ruler was Akbar (1556–1605). After the death of Aurangjeb (1658–1707), the Mughal Empire became weak. It continued until 1857. By that time, India came under the British Raj.\n\nAmerica \n\nSettlement by the Spanish started the European colonization of the Americas, it meant genocide of the native Indians. The Spanish gained control of most of the Caribbean and conquered the Aztecs. So they founded the Spanish Empire in the New World.\n\nThe first successful English settlements were in North America at Jamestown (Virginia), 1607 (along with its satellite, Bermuda in 1609) and Plymouth (Massachusetts), 1620. The first French settlements were Port Royal (1604) and Quebec City (1608). The Fur Trade soon became the primary business on the continent and as a result transformed the Native Americans lifestyle. Plantation slavery of the West Indies lead to the beginning of the Atlantic slave trade.\n\nRivalry between the European powers created a series of wars on the North American landmass. The American Revolution led to the creation of the United States of America. Spain\'s hold on its colonies weakened till it had to give them independence.\n\nThe United States expanded quickly to the west. At the same time, British built more in Canada.\n\nAfrica \nDuring the 15th century the Portuguese began exploring Africa. At the Guinea coast they built their first fort in 1482.  They started slave trade after the first European contact with America in 1492 to supply settlers from there with workers.  Soon English, Spanish, Dutch, French and Danish merchants also built forts.  But their influence on the inland was minor (except from decimation of population by slave trade) till during the 19th century larger colonies were founded.\n\nTwentieth Century onward \n\nThe 20th century was a very important time in history. New technology and different ideas led to many worldwide changes in the time of just 100 years.\n\nWorld Wars\n\nThe First World War \n\nWorld War I was a war fought from 1914 to 1918. During the time of the war, it was called "The Great War", or "The War to End All Wars". Chemical poisons, tanks, aeroplanes, and bombs were used for the first time.\n\nThere were four main causes of the war:\n Imperialism\n Nationalism\n Alliances\n Militarism\n\nThese were causes that made it likely that a war would start in Europe. The "spark" that started the war was the assassination of the heir to the throne in Austria-Hungary: Archduke Franz Ferdinand by a group of young Serbians. Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia and each country\'s allies then joined the war. This created a bigger conflict which turned into World War I.\n\nEurope divided into two groups of allies: the Central Powers and the Allied Powers (the "Allies"). The Central Powers were made up of Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria. The Allies were made up of Britain, France, Russia, Italy and the United States.\n\nWorld War I was fought on two fronts; the Eastern Front and the Western Front. Trench warfare was commonly used on the Eastern Front.\n\nBecause of a British blockade, Germany began using U-boats, or submarines, to sink British ships. After the sinking of two ships with Americans on board, and the public release of the Zimmermann Note, The U.S. declared war on Germany, joining the Allies.\n\nOn November 11, 1918, Germany signed the armistice, meaning "the laying down of arms", to end the war. After the war ended, the Treaty of Versailles was written and Germany was made to sign it. They had to pay $33 million in reparations (payment for damage).  The influenza pandemic of 1918 spread around the world, killing millions.\n\nAfter the First War \nAfter the war the German Empire, the Russian Empire, the Ottoman Empire and Austrian Empire ended and France and Britain got weaker.\nThe 1920s and 1930s had military-related fascist dictators take control of Italy, Germany, Japan and Spain. They were helped by the Great Depression starting in 1929. When Hitler in 1933 had gained power in Germany he prepared World War II.\n\nThe Second World War \n\nOf all the wars ever fought, World War II involved the most countries and killed the most people. More than 60 million people died, making it the worst disaster of all time. It lasted six years in Europe, from 1939 to 1945.\nIt was fought between the Axis Powers (Germany, Italy and Japan) and the Allied Powers. At first the Axis Powers were successful, but that ended in Europe with the Battle of Stalingrad in 1943 and the invasion in Normandy in 1944. But Hitler was able to pursue his plan to annihilate Jews nearly all over Europe. Today, this plan is called the Holocaust.\nIn the Pacific it ended with the battles of Midway and Guadalcanal. Germany surrendered on May 8. The Soviet invasion of Japan led Japan to surrender on August 15, 1945.\n\nAfter World War II \nAfter World War II the United Nations was founded in the hope that it could solve arguments among nations and keep wars from happening. Communism spread to Central and Eastern Europe, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Romania, Albania, North Vietnam and North Korea. In 1949, China became communist. During the 1950s and 1960s, many third world countries became communist.\n\nThis led to the Cold War, a forty-year argument between the United States, the Soviet Union, and their allies (mainly countries that were members of NATO or the Warsaw Pact). Each country wanted to promote their type of government. The Soviet Union wanted to spread communism, and the United States wanted to spread democracy. People across the world feared a nuclear war because of the tension.\n\nCommunism became less popular when it became clear that it could not promote economic growth as well as Western states and that it was not suited for a reform that allowed freedom of speech for everybody. Therefore, the Soviet Union forced Hungary to give up its reform in 1956, it favored the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961 and it stopped reform in Czechoslovakia in 1968. When in 1988/89 Gorbachev made clear that he would not force the countries of the East block to stick to Communism the Berlin Wall was torn down in 1989 and the Soviet Union collapsed (1991). Then the United States was the only superpower left.\n\nAfter Mao Zedong\'s death China\'s communist party proved that economic reform was possible without political freedom and paved the way for enormous economic growth.\n\nAs the 20th century ended, the European Union began to rise and included former satellite states and even parts of the Soviet Union. States in Asia, Africa and South America tried to copy the European Union.\n\nThe twentieth century was a time of great progress in terms of technology. People began to live longer because of better medicine and medical technology. New communications and transportation technologies connected the world. But these advances also helped cause problems with the environment.\n\nThe last half of the century had smaller wars.  Improved information technology and globalization increased trade and cultural exchange.  Space exploration expanded through the solar system.  The structure of DNA was discovered.\n\nThe same period also raised questions about the end of human history because of global dangers: nuclear weapons, greenhouse effect and other problems in the environment.\n\n21st century \n\nAs the 20th century ended, globalization has continued. During this period, communications with mobile phones and the Internet have expanded, which has led to fundamental social changes in corporation, political, and individuals\' personal lives. Due to the population of growth and industrialization, worldwide resource competition is becoming increasingly highly, especially in India, China and Brazil. The increasing demand on the environmental degradation and global warming.\n\nA new Great Recession affected the world in the late 2000s and the early 2010s, and the COVID-19 pandemic spread in 2020, causing further economic and political disruption. Some scientists referred to this as a "Planetary Phase of Civilization".\n\nRelated pages \n History of Africa\n History of America\n History of Asia\n History of Australia\n History of Europe\n History of the Earth\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading \n \nEnglish translation by Paul G.

## Encode a question with OpenAI embedding model

To perform kNN search, we need to encode queries with the same embedding model used to encode the documents at index time.
In this example, we need to use the `text-embedding-3-small` model.

You'll need your OpenAI [API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) to generate the embeddings.


```python
# Get OpenAI API key
OPENAI_API_KEY = getpass("Enter OpenAI API key")

# Set API key
openai.api_key = OPENAI_API_KEY

# Define model
EMBEDDING_MODEL = "text-embedding-3-small"

# Define question
question = 'Is the Atlantic the biggest ocean in the world?'

# Create embedding
question_embedding = openai.Embedding.create(input=question, model=EMBEDDING_MODEL)

```

## Run semantic search queries

Now we're ready to run queries against our Elasticsearch index using our encoded question. We'll be doing a k-nearest neighbors search, using the Elasticsearch [kNN query](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/knn-search.html) option.

First, we define a small function to pretty print the results.


```python
# Function to pretty print Elasticsearch results

def pretty_response(response):
    for hit in response['hits']['hits']:
        id = hit['_id']
        score = hit['_score']
        title = hit['_source']['title']
        text = hit['_source']['text']
        pretty_output = (f"\nID: {id}\nTitle: {title}\nSummary: {text}\nScore: {score}")
        print(pretty_output)
```

Now let's run our `kNN` query.


```python
response = client.search(
  index = "wikipedia_vector_index",
  knn={
      "field": "content_vector",
      "query_vector":  question_embedding["data"][0]["embedding"],
      "k": 10,
      "num_candidates": 100
    }
)
pretty_response(response)

top_hit_summary = response['hits']['hits'][0]['_source']['text'] # Store content of top hit for final step

    Title: Atlantic Ocean
    Summary: The Atlantic Ocean is the world's second largest ocean.  It covers a total area of about . It covers about 20 percent of the Earth's surface. It is named after the god Atlas from Greek mythology.
    
    Geologic history 
    The Atlantic formed when the Americas moved west from Eurasia and Africa. This began sometime in the Cretaceous period, roughly 135 million years ago. It was part of the break-up of the supercontinent Pangaea.
    
    The east coast of South America is shaped somewhat like the west coast of Africa, and this gave a clue that continents moved over long periods of time (continental drift). The Atlantic Ocean is still growing now, because of sea-floor spreading from the mid-Atlantic Ridge, while the Pacific Ocean is said to be shrinking because the sea floor is folding under itself or subducting into the mantle.
    
    Geography
    The Atlantic Ocean is bounded on the west by North and South America. It connects to the Arctic Ocean through the Denmark Strait, Greenland Sea, Norwegian Sea and Barents Sea. It connects with the Mediterranean Sea through the Strait of Gibraltar.
    
    In the southeast, the Atlantic merges into the Indian Ocean. The 20° East meridian defines its border.
    
    In the southwest, the Drake Passage connects it to the Pacific Ocean. The Panama Canal links the Atlantic and Pacific.
    
    The Atlantic Ocean is second in size to the Pacific. It occupies an area of about . The volume of the Atlantic, along with its adjacent seas (the seas next to it), is 354,700,000 cubic kilometres.
    
    The average depth of the Atlantic, along with its adjacent seas, is . The greatest depth is Milwaukee Deep near Puerto Rico, where the Ocean is  deep.
    
    Gulf Stream 
    The Atlantic Ocean has important ocean currents.  One of these, called the Gulf Stream, flows across the North Atlantic.  Water gets heated by the sun in the Caribbean Sea and then moves northwest toward the North Pole.  This makes France, the British Isles, Iceland, and Norway in Europe much warmer in winter than Newfoundland and Nova Scotia in Canada. Without the Gulf Stream, the climates of northeast Canada and northwest Europe might be the same, because these places are about the same distance from the North Pole.
    
    There are currents in the South Atlantic too, but the shape of this sea means that it has less effect on South Africa.
    
    Geology 
    The main feature of the Atlantic Ocean's seabed is a large underwater mountain chain called the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.  It runs from north to south under the Ocean. This is at the boundary of four tectonic plates: Eurasian, North American, South American and African. The ridge extends from Iceland in the north to about 58° south.
    
    The salinity of the surface waters of the open ocean ranges from 3337 parts per thousand and varies with latitude and season.

    Title: Pacific Ocean
    Summary: The Pacific Ocean is the body of water between Asia and Australia in the west, the Americas in the east, the Southern Ocean to the south, and the Arctic Ocean to the north. It is the largest named ocean and it covers one-third of the surface of the entire world. It joins the Atlantic Ocean at a line drawn  south from Cape Horn, Chile/Argentina to Antarctica, and joins the Indian Ocean at a line drawn  south from Tasmania, Australia to Antarctica.
    
    As the Atlantic slowly gets wider, the Pacific is slowly shrinking. It does this by folding the sea floor in towards the centre of the Earth - this is called subduction.  This bumping and grinding is hard so there are many earthquakes and volcanoes when the pressure builds up and is quickly released as large explosions of hot rocks and dust. When an earthquake happens under the sea, the quick jerk causes a tsunami. This is why tsunamis are more common around the edge of the Pacific than anywhere else. Many of the Earth's volcanoes are either islands in the Pacific, or are on continents within a few hundred kilometers of the ocean's edge. Plate tectonics are another reason which makes Pacific Ocean smaller.

    Title: Arctic Ocean
    Summary: The Arctic Ocean is the ocean around the North Pole. The most northern parts of Eurasia and North America are around the Arctic Ocean. Thick pack ice and snow cover almost all of this ocean in winter, and most of it in summer. An icebreaker or a nuclear-powered submarine can use the Northwest Passage through the Arctic Ocean to go between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.
    
    The ocean's area is about 14.056 million km2, which is the smallest of the world's 5 oceans, and it has  of coastline. The central surface covered by ice about  thick. The biology there is quite special. Endangered species there include walruses, whales and polar bears. Year by year the Arctic Ocean is becoming less icy, as a result of global warming.
    
    The average depth of the Arctic Ocean is . The deepest point is in the Eurasian Basin, at .
    
    Geography 
    The Arctic Ocean covers an area of about 14,056,000 km2.  The coastline is 45,390 km (28,200 mi) long It is surrounded by Eurasia, North America, Greenland, and by several islands.
    
    It is generally taken to include Baffin Bay, Barents Sea, Beaufort Sea, Chukchi Sea, East Siberian Sea, Greenland Sea, Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, Kara Sea, Laptev Sea, White Sea and other bodies of water. It is connected to the Pacific Ocean by the Bering Strait  and to the Atlantic Ocean through the Greenland Sea and Labrador Sea.
    
    Countries bordering the Arctic Ocean are: Russia, Norway, Iceland, Greenland, Canada and the United States.
    
    Climate 
    The Arctic Ocean is in a polar climate. Winters are characterized by the polar night, cold and stable weather conditions, and clear skies.
    
    The temperature of the surface of the Arctic Ocean is fairly constant, near the freezing point of seawater.  Arctic Ocean consists of saltwater but its salinity is less than other oceans. The temperature must reach −1.8 °C (28.8 °F) before freezing occurs.
    
    Ice covers most of the Arctic Ocean. It covers almost the whole ocean in late winter and the majority of the ocean in late summer. Much of the Arctic ice pack is covered in snow for about 10 months of the year. The maximum snow cover is in March or April — about 20 to 50 cm (7.9 to 19.7 in).
    
    The climate of the Arctic region has varied significantly in the past. As recently as 55 million years ago, during the eocene epoch, the region reached an average annual temperature of 10–20 °C (50–68 °F). The surface waters of the Arctic Ocean warmed enough to support tropical lifeforms.
    
    Animal and plant life 
    Endangered marine species in the Arctic Ocean include walruses and whales. The area has a fragile ecosystem. The Arctic Ocean has relatively little plant life except for phytoplankton.  Phytoplankton are a crucial part of the ocean. They feed on nutrients from rivers and the currents of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.

    Title: Caribbean Sea
    Summary: The Caribbean Sea is a tropical sea in the center of the Caribbean area. The body of water is part of the Atlantic Ocean. The sea is southeast of the Gulf of Mexico. The Caribbean Sea has many islands, which are popular among North American tourists because of their tropical climate. The Caribbean Sea is famous around the world as a tourist destination.
    
    History 
    Christopher Columbus came across a group of islands in the Caribbean region. When he did so, he thought he had reached another part of the world. Because of this, he named the islands the ‘West Indies’. However, later it was realized that he found an entire region. It still had its natural resources. The name ‘Caribbean’ was later given to it by the Amerindian tribe, the Caribs. That is how it got its name: the Caribbean Sea.
    
    This entire region covers an area of 1,063,000 sq. miles. It covers from Mexico to the boundaries of South America.
    
    This sea is just as deep as it is wide. Its deepest point is believed to be even lower than 25,220 ft, 7,686 m. That makes this point one of the lowest points on the surface of the earth, and the Caribbean Sea one of the deepest seas in the world.

    Summary: The Irish Sea (sometimes called the Manx Sea) is a body of water that separates Ireland and Great Britain. It is known to be one of the most polluted seas in the world including the North Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. The sea is important to regional trade, shipping and fishing.  It is a source of power generation in the form of wind power and nuclear plants. Annual traffic between Great Britain and Ireland amounts to over 12 million passengers and  of traded goods.
    
    Economics 
    It covers  and at its deepest point is  deep. In 2008, about  of fish were caught. Shell fish made up three quarters of this amount.
    
    The Irish Sea has 17 active oil and gas drilling platforms. It is estimated there are about 1.6 billion barrels of oil in the Barryroe oil field alone.
    
    Sealife 
    At least thirty species of shark can be found in the Irish Sea at different times. These include the basking, thresher, blue, mako and porbeagle sharks. There are about 12 species of Dolphin, porpoise and whales in the Irish Sea. These include the common dolphin, bottlenose dolphin and the harbor porpoise.

    Title: North Sea
    Summary: The North Sea is a sea that is part of the Atlantic Ocean in northern Europe. The North Sea is between Norway and Denmark in the east, Scotland and England in the west, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and France in the south.
    
    Borders 
    The Skagerrak connects the North Sea to the Baltic Sea. In the south, the North Sea becomes the English Channel, a sea between England and France. This is called the Dover Straits and is very busy with ships.
    
    The border between the North Sea and the Skagerrak is at an imagined line between Lindesnes in Norway, and Hanstholm in Denmark. In the North, the North sea is open towards the Atlantic. The border between the two is an imagined line from Northern Scotland, to Shetland, and then to Ålesund in Norway. According to the Oslo-Paris Treaty of 1962 it is a bit more to the west and the north though. The treaty puts it at 5° East longitude, and 62° North latitude. That is at the parallel of the Geirangerfjord in Norway.
    
    Various statistical data 
    On average, the North Sea has a depth of only 94 meters. About 80 million people live near the North Sea, at most 150 km away from the coast. Together with the English Channel in the south, the southern North Sea is the busiest body of water in the world.
    
    Rivers that drain into it 
    Well-known rivers that drain into the North Sea include the Tay (at Dundee), the Forth (at Edinburgh), the Tyne (South Shields), the Wear (at Sunderland),  the Tees (near Middlesbrough),  the Elbe (at Cuxhaven), the Weser (at Bremerhaven), the Rhine and Meuse or Maas (at Rotterdam), the Scheldt (at Flushing or Vlissingen), the Thames, and the Humber (at Hull), and the river Nairn (at Nairn)
    
    The Kiel Canal, one of the world's busiest artificial waterways, connects the North Sea with the Baltic.
    
    Name 
    Its name comes from its relationship to the land of the Frisians (see Frisia). They live directly to the south of the North Sea, and to the west of the East Sea (Oostzee, the Baltic Sea), the former South Sea (Zuiderzee, today's IJsselmeer) and the today reclaimed Middle Sea (Middelzee). But the spread of the name could also be from the view of the cities of the Hanseatic League. Some of its main cities, like Lübeck, Bremen or Hamburg had the same view.
    
    In classical times this body of water was also called the Oceanum Germanicum or Mare Germanicum, meaning German Ocean or Sea. This name was commonly used in English and other languages along with the name North Sea, until the early eighteenth century. By the late nineteenth century, German Sea was a rare, scholarly usage even in Germany. In Danish the North Sea is also named Vesterhavet (besides Nordsøen), meaning Western Ocean because it is west of Denmark.
    
    Geographic divisions 
    
    Most of the North sea is on the European Continental shelf. On average, the depth is about 93 to 94 meters only. In the south it is very shallow, only 25 to 35 meters. In the north in the bathyal zone north of Shetland, this depth increases to between 100 and 200 metres. In the south, the depth is at most 50 metres. An exception to this is the Norwegian Trench. It is deepest there, with a depth of 725 metres. The most shallow part of it is a sand bank called Dogger Bank. In the southern part, there are many sand banks.
    
    Looking at the satellite picture it is easy to see the geographic divisions of the North Sea:
    a generally shallow southern North Sea
    the central North Sea
     the northern North Sea, with the Norwegian Trench, near the Skagerrak.
    
    The southern north sea is composed of the Southern Bight, before the coast of Belgium and the Netherlands and the German Bight before the coastline of Germany. The Dogger Bank is the limit between the southern and central parts. The Waddenzee runs all the way from Den Helder in the Netherlands to Esbjerg in Denmark.
    
    The Dogger Bank covers an area about half the size of the Netherlands. There, the North Sea has a depth of between 13 and 20 metres only. The area is very famous for fishing. With some storms there are even waves breaking there.
    
    The Norwegian Trench has an average depth of around 250 to 300 metres; at the entrance to the Skagerrak, the depth increases up to 725 meters. Along the trench is the Norwegian Current, which brings most of the waters of the North Sea into the Atlantic Ocean. Also, most of the waters of the Baltic Sea flow northwards here.
    
    About 200 km east of the Scottish city of Dundee there are more trenches, known collectively as the Devil's hole. Generally, the water is about 90 meters deep there. The trenches very often are only a few kilometers in length. In these trenches, the depth increases to up to 230 meters.
    
    In the Dover Strait the water is about 30 meters deep. At the end of the English Channel, this depth increases to about 100 meters.
    
    History 
    In the last ice age the North Sea was covered by large areas of ice called glaciers. About 20,000 years ago the ice melted and the North Sea was formed (made).
    
    North Sea oil 
    In the 1960s, geologists found large areas of oil and natural gas under the North Sea. Most of the oil fields are owned by the United Kingdom and Norway but some belong to Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany. Drilling began in the 1960s and led to a famous argument between England and Scotland about how the revenue (money) from the oil should be spent.
    
    Animal life 
    
    People have been fishing in the North Sea for thousands of years. However, so many fish are now caught there that new ones may not be able to grow fast enough to keep the fishery going.
    
    Terns, Atlantic puffins, razorbills, kittiwakes and other seabirds live on the North Sea coast. Many coastal areas are protected nature reserves.

    Title: Atlantis
    Summary: Atlantis is a name for a fictional large island or small continent that was (in the legend) in the Atlantic Ocean many years before it sank into the depth of the sea .
    
    The name Atlantis first appears in the writings of Herodotus - he describes the western ocean as "Sea of Atlantis." Then, one generation later, Atlantis is described in detail in the stories Timaeus and Critias by the Greek philosopher Plato.  He used this story to help explain his ideas about government and philosophy. Plato was the only ancient writer who wrote specific things about Atlantis.
    
    According to Plato, the Atlanteans lived 9000 years before his own time and were half human and half god.  They created a very good human society.  When they stopped being good people and did bad things, the gods sent earthquakes and fire to destroy Atlantis.
    
    Many scholars think Plato could have been thinking of a real place when he wrote about Atlantis.  Many, many people have thought of many, many places where the real place that inspired Atlantis could have been.  For example, there was a Minoan kingdom on the island of Santorini.  The Minoan kingdom was very powerful thousands of years before Plato, and their society was damaged when a volcano erupted on their island. According to Plato, Atlantis was very large, as big as North Africa, so it should not have been hard to find.
    
    After the discovery of the Americas, some people in Europe thought they might be Atlantis. However, after Plato, the idea of Atlantis was mostly forgotten until 1882, when a writer named Ignatius Donnelly wrote a book saying that Atlantis was real and that the culture of Atlantis had started many other ancient cultures, such as the Egyptian and Mayan.  Then other people became interested in Atlantis. 
    
    Atlantis has appeared in many works of fiction.  In Marvel Comics, Atlantis is at the bottom of the ocean and exists in modern times, with people who breathe water.  Other works of fiction use Atlantis as background.  For example, Robert E. Howard set his Conan the Barbarian stories in a fictional time called the Hyborian Age, which began with the destruction of Atlantis and ended when real written history started.

Success! We've used kNN to perform semantic search over our dataset and found the top results.

Now we can use the Chat Completions API to work some generative AI magic using the top search result as additional context.

## Use Chat Completions API for retrieval augmented generation

Now we can send the question and the text to OpenAI's chat completion API.

Using a LLM model together with a retrieval model is known as retrieval augmented generation (RAG). We're using Elasticsearch to do what it does best, retrieve relevant documents. Then we use the LLM to do what it does best, tasks like generating summaries and answering questions, using the retrieved documents as context. 

The model will generate a response to the question, using the top kNN hit as context. Use the `messages` list to shape your prompt to the model. In this example, we're using the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model.


```python
summary = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
  model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
  messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Answer the following question:" 
         + question 
         + "by using the following text:" 
         + top_hit_summary},
    ]
)

choices = summary.choices

for choice in choices:
    print("------------------------------------------------------------")
    print(choice.message.content)
    print("------------------------------------------------------------")

    No, the Atlantic Ocean is not the biggest ocean in the world. It is the second largest ocean, covering about 20 percent of the Earth's surface. The Pacific Ocean is the largest ocean in the world.
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    



### Code explanation

Here's what that code does:

- Uses OpenAI's model to generate a response
- Sends a conversation containing a system message and a user message to the model
- The system message sets the assistant's role as "helpful assistant"
- The user message contains a question as specified in the original kNN query and some input text
- The response from the model is stored in the `summary.choices` variable

## Next steps

That was just one example of how to combine Elasticsearch with the power of OpenAI's models, to enable retrieval augmented generation. RAG allows you to avoid the costly and complex process of training or fine-tuning models, by leveraging out-of-the-box models, enhanced with additional context.

Use this as a blueprint for your own experiments.

To adapt the conversation for different use cases, customize the system message to define the assistant's behavior or persona. Adjust the user message to specify the task, such as summarization or question answering, along with the desired format of the response.

- Perform semantic search on the Elasticsearch index using the encoded question

## Install packages and import modules 


```python
# install packages

!python3 -m pip install -qU openai pandas wget elasticsearch

# import modules

from getpass import getpass
from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch, helpers
import wget
import zipfile
import pandas as pd
import json
import openai
```

## Connect to Elasticsearch

ℹ️ We're using an Elastic Cloud deployment of Elasticsearch for this notebook.
If you don't already have an Elastic deployment, you can sign up for a free [Elastic Cloud trial](https://cloud.elastic.co/registration?utm_source=github&utm_content=openai-cookbook).

To connect to Elasticsearch, you need to create a client instance with the Cloud ID and password for your deployment.

Find the Cloud ID for your deployment by going to https://cloud.elastic.co/deployments and selecting your deployment.


```python
CLOUD_ID = getpass("Elastic deployment Cloud ID")
CLOUD_PASSWORD = getpass("Elastic deployment Password")
client = Elasticsearch(
  cloud_id = CLOUD_ID,
  basic_auth=("elastic", CLOUD_PASSWORD) # Alternatively use `api_key` instead of `basic_auth`
)

# Test connection to Elasticsearch
print(client.info())
```

## Download the dataset 

In this step we download the OpenAI Wikipedia embeddings dataset, and extract the zip file.


```python
embeddings_url = 'https://cdn.openai.com/API/examples/data/vector_database_wikipedia_articles_embedded.zip'
wget.download(embeddings_url)

with zipfile.ZipFile("vector_database_wikipedia_articles_embedded.zip",
"r") as zip_ref:
    zip_ref.extractall("data")
```

##  Read CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame

Next we use the Pandas library to read the unzipped CSV file into a DataFrame. This step makes it easier to index the data into Elasticsearch in bulk.


```python

wikipedia_dataframe = pd.read_csv("data/vector_database_wikipedia_articles_embedded.csv")
```

## Create index with mapping

Now we need to create an Elasticsearch index with the necessary mappings. This will enable us to index the data into Elasticsearch.

We use the `dense_vector` field type for the `title_vector` and  `content_vector` fields. This is a special field type that allows us to store dense vectors in Elasticsearch.

Later, we'll need to target the `dense_vector` field for kNN search.



```python
index_mapping= {
    "properties": {
      "title_vector": {
          "type": "dense_vector",
          "dims": 1536,
          "index": "true",
          "similarity": "cosine"
      },
      "content_vector": {
          "type": "dense_vector",
          "dims": 1536,
          "index": "true",
          "similarity": "cosine"
      },
      "text": {"type": "text"},
      "title": {"type": "text"},
      "url": { "type": "keyword"},
      "vector_id": {"type": "long"}
      
    }
}

client.indices.create(index="wikipedia_vector_index", mappings=index_mapping)
```




    ObjectApiResponse({'acknowledged': True, 'shards_acknowledged': True, 'index': 'wikipedia_vector_index'})



## Index data into Elasticsearch 

The following function generates the required bulk actions that can be passed to Elasticsearch's Bulk API, so we can index multiple documents efficiently in a single request.

For each row in the DataFrame, the function yields a dictionary representing a single document to be indexed. 


```python
def dataframe_to_bulk_actions(df):
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        yield {
            "_index": 'wikipedia_vector_index',
            "_id": row['id'],
            "_source": {
                'url' : row["url"],
                'title' : row["title"],
                'text' : row["text"],
                'title_vector' : json.loads(row["title_vector"]),
                'content_vector' : json.loads(row["content_vector"]),
                'vector_id' : row["vector_id"]
            }
        }
```

As the dataframe is large, we will index data in batches of `100`. We index the data into Elasticsearch using the Python client's [helpers](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/python-api/current/client-helpers.html#bulk-helpers) for the bulk API.


```python
start = 0
end = len(wikipedia_dataframe)
batch_size = 100
for batch_start in range(start, end, batch_size):
    batch_end = min(batch_start + batch_size, end)
    batch_dataframe = wikipedia_dataframe.iloc[batch_start:batch_end]
    actions = dataframe_to_bulk_actions(batch_dataframe)
    helpers.bulk(client, actions)
```

Let's test the index with a simple match query.


```python
print(client.search(index="wikipedia_vector_index", body={
    "_source": {
        "excludes": ["title_vector", "content_vector"]
    },
    "query": {
        "match": {
            "text": {
                "query": "Hummingbird"
            }
        }
    }
}))
```

The smallest living bird species is the 2–5\xa0cm Bee Hummingbird. They can hover in mid-air by rapidly flapping their wings 12–80 times per second (depending on the species). They are also the only group of birds able to fly backwards. Their rapid wing beats do actually hum. They can fly at speeds over 15\xa0m/s (54\xa0km/h, 34\xa0mi/h).\n\nEating habits and pollination \nHummingbirds help flowers to pollinate, though most insects are best known for doing so. The hummingbird enjoys nectar, like the butterfly and other flower-loving insects, such as bees.\n\nHummingbirds do not have a good sense of smell; instead, they are attracted to color, especially the color red. Unlike the butterfly, the hummingbird hovers over the flower as it drinks nectar from it, like a moth. When it does so, it flaps its wings very quickly to stay in one place, which makes it look like a blur and also beats so fast it makes a humming sound. A hummingbird sometimes puts its whole head into the flower to drink the nectar properly. When it takes its head back out, its head is covered with yellow pollen, so that when it moves to another flower, it can pollinate. Or sometimes it may pollinate with its beak.\n\nLike bees, hummingbirds can assess the amount of sugar in the nectar they eat. They reject flowers whose nectar has less than 10% sugar. Nectar is a poor source of nutrients, so hummingbirds meet their needs for protein, amino acids, vitamins, minerals, etc. by preying on insects and spiders.\n\nFeeding apparatus \nMost hummingbirds have bills that are long and straight or nearly so, but in some species the bill shape is adapted for specialized feeding. Thornbills have short, sharp bills adapted for feeding from flowers with short corollas and piercing the bases of longer ones. The Sicklebills' extremely decurved bills are adapted to extracting nectar from the curved corollas of flowers in the family Gesneriaceae. The bill of the Fiery-tailed Awlbill has an upturned tip, as in the Avocets. The male Tooth-billed Hummingbird has barracuda-like spikes at the tip of its long, straight bill.\n\nThe two halves of a hummingbird's bill have a pronounced overlap, with the lower half (mandible) fitting tightly inside the upper half (maxilla). When hummingbirds feed on nectar, the bill is usually only opened slightly, allowing the tongue to dart out into the nectar.\n\nLike the similar nectar-feeding sunbirds and unlike other birds, hummingbirds drink by using grooved or trough-like tongues which they can stick out a long way.\nHummingbirds do not spend all day flying, as the energy cost would be prohibitive; the majority of their activity consists simply of sitting or perching. Hummingbirds feed in many small meals, consuming many small invertebrates and up to twelve times their own body weight in nectar each day. They spend an average of 10–15% of their time feeding and 75–80% sitting and digesting.\n\nCo-evolution with flowers\n\nSince hummingbirds are specialized nectar-eaters, they are tied to the bird-flowers they feed upon. Some species, especially those with unusual bill shapes such as the Sword-billed Hummingbird and the sicklebills, are co-evolved with a small number of flower species.\n\nMany plants pollinated by hummingbirds produce flowers in shades of red, orange, and bright pink, though the birds will take nectar from flowers of many colors. Hummingbirds can see wavelengths into the near-ultraviolet. However, their flowers do not reflect these wavelengths as many insect-pollinated flowers do. The narrow color spectrum may make hummingbird-pollinated flowers inconspicuous to insects, thereby reducing nectar robbing by insects. Hummingbird-pollinated flowers also produce relatively weak nectar (averaging 25% sugars w/w) containing high concentrations of sucrose, whereas insect-pollinated flowers typically produce more concentrated nectars dominated by fructose and glucose.\n\nTaxonomy \nHummingbirds have traditionally been a part of the bird order Apodiformes. This order includes the hummingbirds, the swifts and the tree swifts. The Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy of birds, based on DNA studies done in the 1970s and 1980s, changed the classification of hummingbirds. Instead of being in the same order as the swifts, the hummingbirds were made an order, the Trochiliformes. Their previous order, Apodiformes was changed to the superorder Apodimorphae. This superorder contains the three families of birds which were in it when it was an order.\n\nReferences", 'vector_id': 10024}}, {'_index': 'wikipedia_vector_index', '_id': '84773', '_score': 10.951234, '_source': {'url': 'https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inagua', 'title': 'Inagua', 'text': "Inagua is the southernmost district of the Bahamas.

Technically speaking, they are dinosaurs. \n\nBirds are endothermic. The heat loss from their bodies is slowed down by their feathers. \nModern birds are toothless: they have beaked jaws. They lay hard-shelled eggs. They have a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart and a strong yet lightweight skeleton.\n\nBirds live all over the world. They range in size from the 5 cm (2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.70 m (9 ft) ostrich. They are the tetrapods with the most living species: about ten thousand. More than half of these are passerines, sometimes known as perching birds.\n\nBirds are the closest living relatives of the Crocodilia. This is because they are the two main survivors of a once huge group called the Archosaurs. \n\nModern birds are not descended from Archaeopteryx. According to DNA evidence, modern birds (Neornithes) evolved in the long Upper Cretaceous period. More recent estimates showed that  modern birds originated early in the Upper Cretaceous.\n\nPrimitive bird-like dinosaurs are in the broader group Avialae. They have been found back to the mid-Jurassic period, around 170 million years ago. Many of these early "stem-birds", such as Anchiornis, were not yet capable of fully powered flight. Many had primitive characteristics like teeth in their jaws and long bony tails.p274\n\nThe Cretaceous–Palaeogene extinction event 66 million years ago killed off all the non-avian dinosaur lines. Birds, especially those in the southern continents, survived this event and then migrated to other parts of the world. Diversification occurred around the Cretaceous–Palaeogene extinction event. \n\nBirds have wings which are more or less developed depending on the species. The only known groups without wings are the extinct moa and elephant birds. Wings, which evolved from forelimbs, gave birds the ability to fly. Later, many groups evolved with reduced wings, such as ratites, penguins and many island species of birds. The digestive and respiratory systems of birds are also adapted for flight. Some bird species in aquatic environments, particularly seabirds and some waterbirds, have evolved as good swimmers.\n\nIn general, birds are effective, and inherit their behaviour almost entirely. The key elements of their life are inherited. It was a great discovery that birds never learn to fly. \nSo it is quite wrong to say, when a chick waves its wings in the nest "It\'s learning to fly". What the chick is doing is exercising its muscles. They develop the ability to fly automatically (assuming they are species that do fly). And if they are species which migrate, that behaviour is also inherited. Many species migrate over great distances each year. Other main features of their life may be inherited, though they can and do learn. Birds have good memories which they use, for example, when they search for food.\n\nSeveral bird species make and use tools. Some social species pass on some knowledge across generations, a form of culture. Birds are social. They communicate with visual signals, calls and bird songs. Most of their social behaviours are inherited, such as cooperative breeding and hunting, flocking and mobbing of predators.\n\nMost bird species are socially monogamous, usually for one breeding season at a time, sometimes for years, but rarely for life. Other species are polygynous (one male with many females) or, rarely, polyandrous (one female with many males). Birds produce offspring by laying eggs which are fertilised by sexual reproduction. They are often laid in a nest and incubated by the parents. Most birds have an extended period of parental care after hatching. Some birds, such as hens, lay eggs even when not fertilised, though unfertilised eggs do not produce offspring.\n\nMany species of birds are eaten by humans. Domesticated and undomesticated birds are sources of eggs, meat, and feathers.  In English, domesticated birds are often called poultry, undomesticated birds are called game. Songbirds, parrots and other species are popular as pets. Guano, which is bird manure, is harvested for use as a fertiliser. Birds figure throughout human culture. About 120–130 species have become extinct due to human activity since the 17th century and hundreds more before then. Human activity threatens about 1,200 bird species with extinction, though efforts are underway to protect them. Recreational bird-watching is an important part of the ecotourism industry.\n\nBird colours \n\nBirds come in a huge range of colours. These colours can be useful to a bird in two ways. Camouflage colours help to hide the bird, and bright colours identify the bird to others of the same species. Often the male is brightly coloured while the female is camouflaged. The logic is as follows: the female carries the "precious package" of developing eggs. The male has to defend a territory, and the function of his colour and song is to let others know that "this place is occupied".\n\nBird camouflage \n\nMany birds are brown, green or grey. These colours make a bird harder to be seen: they camouflage the bird. Brown is the most common colour. Brown birds include: sparrows, emus, thrushes, larks, eagles and falcons and the female birds of many species such as: wrens, ducks, blackbirds and peafowls. When a brown bird is in long grass or among tree trunks or rocks, it is camouflaged. Birds that live in long grass often have brown feathers streaked with black which looks like shadows. A bittern is almost invisible in long reeds because its camouflage is helped by its posture (beak and head pointed upwards). Other birds, including starlings and mynas, are quite dark in colour, but are flecked with little spots that look like raindrops on leaves. Bird may also camouflage their nests.\n\nMany birds from hot countries are green or have some green feathers, particularly parrots. Birds that live in green trees often have green backs, even if they have bright-coloured breasts. From the back, the birds are camouflaged. This is very useful when sitting on a nest. The bird\'s bright-coloured breast is hidden. Budgerigars are bred in different colours such as blue, white and mauve, but in the wild, they are nearly all green and yellow. Even though they fly very well, they normally spend a lot of time on the ground, eating grass seeds. Their yellow and black striped back helps to hide them in the shadows made by long dry grass, while their green breasts are a similar colour to the leaves of gum trees.\n\nGrey birds include most pigeons and doves, cranes, storks and herons. Grey birds are often rock-living birds like pigeons or birds that sit on dead tree trunks looking like a broken branch. Water birds like herons often have a pale grey colour which makes it harder for a fish to notice that the bird is standing, looking down for something to catch. Water birds, no matter what colour they are on top, are often white underneath, so that when a fish looks up, the bird looks like part of the sky.\n\nBlack birds include crows, ravens and male blackbirds. Some birds that are dark colours spend quite a lot of time on the ground, hopping around in the shadows under bushes. Among these birds are the male blackbird and the satin bowerbird which is not black but very dark blue. Crows and ravens often perch high on bare trees in the winter, where their black shape against the sky looks like the dark bare branches.\n\nNoticeable colours \n\nMany birds are not camouflaged, but stand out with vivid colours. They are usually male birds whose females are dull and camouflaged. The function of the colours is two-fold. First, the colours help them get mates, and second, the colours identify them to other males of the same species. Many birds are territorial, especially in the nesting season. They give out territory sounds and are easily seen. This lets other males know they will defend their territory. It sends out a "look elsewhere" signal to their competitors.\n\nSome birds are famous for their colour and are named for it, such as the bluebird, the azure kingfisher, the golden pheasant, the scarlet macaw, the violet wren and the robin.\n\nMany other birds are very brightly coloured, in countless combinations. Some of the most colourful birds are quite common, like pheasants, peacocks, domestic fowl and parrots. Colourful small birds include blue tits, the goldfinches, hummingbirds, fairy wrens and bee eaters (which are also called rainbow birds). Some birds, like those of the bird of paradise in Papua New Guinea have such beautiful feathers that they have been hunted for them.\n\nThe peafowl is the best example of a display of colour to attract a mate. Also the male domestic fowl and junglefowl have long shiny feathers above his tail and also long neck feathers that may be a different colour to his wings and body. There are only a very few types of birds (like the eclectus parrot) where the female is more colourful than the male.\n\n\'\'Pied birds\'\' are black and white. Black and white birds include magpies, pied geese, pelicans and Australian magpies (which are not really magpies at all). Pied birds often have brightly coloured beaks and legs of yellow or red. The silver pheasant, with its long white tail striped with fine bars of black, has a brightly coloured face.\n\nFlight \nMost birds can fly, and if they do, then the ability is inherited, not learnt. They fly by pushing through the air with their wings. The curved surfaces of the wings cause air currents (wind) which lift the bird. Flapping keeps the air current moving to create lift and also moves the bird forward.\n\nSome birds can glide on air currents without flapping. Many birds use this method when they are about to land. Some birds can also hover in the air. This method is used by birds of prey such as falcons that are looking for something to eat. Seagulls are also good at hovering, particularly if there is a strong breeze. The most expert hovering birds are tiny hummingbirds which can beat their wings both backwards and forwards and can stay quite still in the air while they dip their long beaks into flowers to feed on the sweet nectar.\n\nTypes of flight \nDifferent types of birds have different needs. Their wings have evolved to suit their lifestyle. Large birds of prey, such as eagles, spend a lot of time soaring on the wind. They have wings that are large and broad. The main flight feathers are long and wide. They help the eagle to stay on rising air currents without using much energy, while the eagle looks at the ground below, to find the next meal. When the eagle sees some small creature move, it can close its wings and fall from the sky like a missile, opening its great wings again to slow down as it comes to land. The world\'s largest eagle, the Philippine eagle has a wingspan of about 2 m (6.7\xa0ft) wide.\n\nBirds that live in grassland areas or open forests and feed on fruit, insects and reptiles often spend a lot of time flying short journeys looking for food and water. They have wings that are shaped in a similar way to eagles, but rounder and not as good for soaring. These include many Australian birds like cockatoos.\n\nBirds such as geese that migrate from one country to another fly very long distances. Their wings are big and strong, because the birds are large. They stock up on food for the long flight. Migrating water birds usually form family groups of 1230 birds. They fly very high, making use of long streams of air that blow from north to south in different seasons. They are well organised, often flying in a V pattern. The geese at the back do not have to flap so hard; they are pulled on by the wind of the ones at the front. Every so often, they change the leader so that the front bird, who does most work and sets the pace, can have a rest. Geese and swans are the highest-flying birds, reaching 8,000 metres or more when on migration. Geese often honk loudly while they are flying. It is thought that they do this to support the leader and help the young ones.\n\nBirds that fly very quickly, such as swifts and swallows, have long narrow pointed wings. These birds need great speed because they eat insects, catching most of them while they are flying. These birds also migrate. They often collect in huge flocks of thousands of birds that move together like a whirling cloud.\n\nBirds that live in bushes and branches have triangular wings that help the bird change direction. Many forest birds are expert at getting up speed by flapping and then gliding steadily among the trees, tilting to avoid things as they go. Members of the kingfisher family are expert at this type of flying.\n\nBirds such as owls that hunt at night have wings with soft rounded feathers so that they do not flap loudly. Birds that are awake at night are called nocturnal birds. Birds that are awake during the day are diurnal.\n\nWandering albatross might spend several years without coming to land. They can sleep while gliding. Arctic terns nest every one to three years.\n\nFlocks \nFlocks of birds can be very highly organised in a way that takes care of all the flock members. Studies of small flocking birds like tree sparrows show that they clearly communicate with each other, as sometimes thousands of birds may fly in close formation and spiral patterns without colliding (or flying into each other).\n\nTwo common behaviours in flocking birds are guarding and reconnaissance. When a flock of birds is feeding it is common for one bird to perch on a high place to keep guard over the flock. In the same way, when a flock is asleep, often, one bird will remain awake. It is also common for large flocks to send one or two birds ahead of them when they are flying to a new area. The look-out birds can spy the lie of the land to find food, water and good places to perch. Mixed feeding flocks occur, and can help to spot predators.\n\nFlightless birds \nSome birds do not fly. Flightlessness in birds has evolved many times.\nThese include running birds like ostriches and emus and ocean-living birds, the large penguin family. Birds on islands have usually lost the power of flight. This is to their advantage because birds with the power of flight can be blown off their island during a storm. The same ability which got them to the island may later take them away in a storm.\n\nOstriches and emus do not need to fly because although they feed and nest on the ground, their great size and their speed is their protection. Some other ground-feeding birds have not been so lucky. Some birds such as the dodo and the kiwi were ground-feeding birds that lived in safety on islands where there was nothing dangerous to eat them. They lost the power of flight. Kiwis are endangered because European settlement to New Zealand brought animals like cats, dogs and rats which kill kiwis and eat their eggs. However, kiwis and also the rare New Zealand ground parrot have survived. In the case of dodos, they were fat and disgusting in taste. All the same, they were killed and eaten by sailors until there was none left. Other flightless birds which have disappeared are the great auk and the moa.\n\nPenguins are a very successful group of birds. They are a clade. They spend half their time on land. Their wings are adapted to life in the sea and have become flippers which let them in swim fast. They catch fish at sea, where they are in danger from seals.\n\nDigestion \nModern birds do not have teeth, and many swallow their prey whole. Nevertheless, they must break up food before it is digested. First of all, along their throat (oesophagus) they have a crop. This stores food items before digestion. That way a bird can eat several items, and then fly off to a quiet spot to digest them. \n\nTheir stomach comes next, with two very different parts. One part is like a straight hollow rod (the proventriculus) which secretes mild hydrochloric acid and an enzyme to break down protein. The other part of the stomach is the gizzard. This is muscular, and grinds up the contents. In herbivorous birds the gizzard contains some gastroliths (small stones or pieces of grit). Bones of fish will mostly be dissolved by the stomach acid. The partly digested and ground-up food now goes to the intestine, where digestion is completed, and most contents are absorbed. Anything indigestible, for example remains of feathers, is regurgitated via the mouth, not the cloaca.\n\nThe system is effective, and carnivorous birds can swallow quite large prey. A blue heron can swallow a fish as large as a carp successfully. Raptors eat by holding the prey down with a foot, and tearing it apart with their beak.\n\nReproduction\n\nMating \nAlthough birds are warm-blooded creatures like mammals, they do not give birth to live young. They lay eggs as reptiles do, but the shell of a bird\'s egg is hard. The baby bird grows inside the egg, and after a few weeks hatches (breaks out of the egg).\n\nBirds in cold climates usually have a breeding season once a year in the spring. Migratory birds can have two springs and two mating seasons in a year. \n\nNinety-five per cent of bird species are socially monogamous. These birds pair for at least the length of the breeding season. In some cases this arrangement lasts until the death of one of the pair. Monogamy clearly helps if females need males\' help to raise a brood successfully. It has other practical advantages: the nest is never left without defence. Birds are generally small, and they have many potential enemies.\n\nSome birds mate for life, like married couples. These birds include pigeons, geese, and cranes. Other birds look for new partners each year. For birds that choose new mates, part of the breeding season is display. The male bird will do all sorts of things to attract females. These include singing, dancing, showing off the feathers and building a beautiful nest. Some male birds have splendid feathers for attracting females. The most famous is the peacock who can spread the feathers above his tail into a huge fan. \n\nOther mating systems do occur in some species. Polygyny, polyandry, polygamy, polygynandry, and promiscuity do happen. Polygamous breeding systems arise when females are able to raise broods without the help of males. Some species may use more than one system depending on the circumstances.\n\nNesting \nOnce the birds have found partners, they find a suitable place to lay eggs. The idea of what is a suitable place differs between species, but most build bird nests. The bird is driven by a hormone (estradiol E2) to prepare a place for the eggs to hatch. Birds\' nests may be up a tree, in a cliff or on the ground according to species. When filled with eggs they are almost always guarded by one of the pair. In fact it is virtually impossible for the eggs to survive if one of the parents dies.\n\nRobins will make a beautiful little round nest of woven grass and carefully line it with feathers, bits of fluff and other soft things. Swallows like to nest near other swallows. They make nests from little blobs of clay, often on a beam near the roof of a building where it is well sheltered. Many birds like a hollow tree to nest in. Eagle\'s nests are often just piles of dead wood on the top of the tallest tree or mountain. Scrub turkeys scratch together a huge pile of leaves that may be 10 metres across. Guillemots lay their eggs on rock shelves with no nest at all. Their eggs are shaped so that they roll around in circles and do not fall off cliffs. A cuckoo does not make its own nest. It lays its egg in the nest of another bird and leaves it for them to care for. The cuckoo eggs are camouflaged to look like the host\'s eggs.\n\nWhen the nest has been prepared, the birds mate so that the eggs are fertilised and the chicks will start growing. Unlike mammals, birds (and reptiles) only have one opening as the exit hole for body fluids, and for reproduction. The opening is called the cloaca. A female bird, called a hen, has two ovaries, of which the left one usually produces eggs.\n\nMost male birds have no sex organs that can be seen. But inside the male are two testes which produce sperm which is stored in the cloaca. Birds mate by rubbing their cloacas together, although with some birds, particularly large water birds, the male has a sort of a penis inside the cloaca.\n\nHatching \nOnce the hen has mated, she produces fertile eggs which have chicks growing inside them. She lays the eggs in the nest. There might be just one egg or a number of them, called a clutch. Emus might lay as many as fifteen huge dark green eggs in a clutch. After the eggs are laid, they are incubated, or kept warm so the chicks form inside. Most birds stay together for the whole nesting season, and one advantage is that the work is shared. Many birds take turns sitting on the eggs, so that each adult can feed.\n\nThis is not always the case. With emus, the male does all the sitting and all the baby-minding. With emperor penguins it is also the male that cares for the egg. There is only one egg, which he keeps on his feet and under his feathers, standing in a big group of males without feeding until the chick is hatched. While the eggs are hatching, the females are at sea, feeding, so that they can care for the chicks when they return.\n\nSome birds put the eggs inside or on top of the mound of leaves and twigs. The mound acts like a compost heap. The decomposition of the rotting leaves causes the temperature to rise. This is heat released by the chemical action of bacterial and fungal respiration. It is the same reaction as that which keeps mammals and birds at a high temperature. The parents leave the mound. When the chicks hatch, they are able to feed themselves.\n\nMany small birds take 2–4 weeks to hatch eggs. Albatrosses take 80 days. During this time the female loses a lot of her body weight.\n\nThe quickest hatching time is for the cuckoo. Some types of cuckoos take only 10 days. This means that when they hatch in the nest of their \'\'foster parents\'\', the eggs that the parents have laid are not yet ready. Newborn cuckoos are naked, blind and ugly, but they are strong. They get under any eggs that are in the nest and throw them out before they hatch. That means that the cuckoo has the whole care of both parents. Baby cuckoos grow fast and often get bigger than the parents who feed them.\n\nWhen baby birds hatch, in most types of birds, they are fed by both parents, and sometimes by older aunties as well. Their mouths are open all the time and are often very brightly coloured, which acts as a releaser\'\', a trigger which stimulates the parent to feed them. For birds that eat grain and fruit, the parents eat and partly digest the food for the babies. It is then vomited carefully into the baby\'s mouth.\n  \n\n Families \nMany birds, particularly those that mate for life, are very sociable and keep together in a family group which might be anything from 4 or 6 adult birds and their young to a very large flock.\n\nAs chicks grow they change the fluffy down that covers them as babies for real feathers. At this stage they are called fledglings. Other family members may help care for fledgling chicks, feeding them and protecting them from attack while parents are feeding. When the fledglings have their new feathers, they come out of the nest to learn to fly. In some types of birds, like pigeons, the parents watch over this and as the young ones get stronger, will give them flying lessons, teaching them how to glide, how to fly in spirals and how to land like an expert.\n\n Communication \nMost birds are social animals, at least part of the time. They communicate to each other using sounds and displays.\n\nAlmost all birds make sounds to communicate. The types of noises that vary greatly. Some birds can sing, and  they are called songbirds or passerines. Examples are robins, larks, canaries, thrushes, nightingales. Corvids are passerines, but they do not sing. Birds that are not songbirds include: pigeons, seagulls, eagles, owls and ducks. Parrots are not songbirds, even though they can be taught to sing human songs.\n\n Songbirds \nAll birds make noises (\'\'bird vocalisation\'\'), but not all sing. Songbirds are passerines, many of which have beautiful melodic songs. Songs have different functions. Danger cries are different from territorial songs and mating calls are a third type. Fledgling may also have different calls from adults. Recognition calls for partners are quite common.\n\nAs to where the song comes from, there are three kinds of species:\nThose where the song is mainly inherited, and the bird always sings the same song in the same situations. The capacity is inherited, and only details are learnt from its neighbours.\nThose where the song is partly inherited, but the bird tunes it in by copying others. In this case the slight differences between the calls of different birds may be used by partners for identification.\nThose where the song is entirely learnt, and the bird often copies sounds from its environment. Only the capacity to sing is inherited.\n\nMost singing birds that are kept as pets, like canaries, have several tunes and some variations.\n\nThe same species of bird will sing different songs in different regions. A good example of this is the currawong. This is an Australia bird which is like a black and white crow. In the autumn, families get together in large flocks and do a lot of singing. Currawongs from some areas sing much more complex songs than others. Generally, currawongs from the Blue Mountains are the finest singers. The song of the currawong can be sung as a solo, but is often performed as a choir. One bird will take the lead and sing "Warble-warble-warble-warble!" All the other birds will join in and sing "Wooooooo!". When all the birds know the song, the choir will sing the "Warble" part and the soloist will sing the "Woo!". The song changes from year to year and from place to place.\n\n Lorenz\'s studies \nThe Austrian naturalist Konrad Lorenz studied the way in which birds communicate, or talk to each other. He found that each type of bird had a number of sounds which they made automatically, when ever they felt a certain way. Every sound had an action that went with it. So, if the bird was frightened, it acted frightened and made a frightened sound. This told the other birds around it that something frightening was happening.\n\nIf a flock of birds were flying over a field, they would be calling "Fly! Fly!" But a hungry bird, seeing something good to eat down below might start calling "Food! Food!" If other birds were also hungry, they would make the same call until more birds were calling "Food! Food!" than "Fly! Fly!". At this point, the mind of the flock would be changed. Some of the birds would start to yell "Fly downwards! Fly downwards!" as they sank from the sky, until the whole flock was all noisily calling the same thing.\n\nThese communication sounds are often short hard sounds like: chirps, squeaks, squawks and twitters. Sometimes the calls are longer and more musical. They include the "Rookety-coo" sound of a pigeon and the "Cockadoodledoo!" of a rooster. The bird cannot change these sounds. They always make them in the same way. The bird is locked into making each sound every time a particular idea comes into its head. The connection between how they feel and how they call is innate: they are born with it. Some calls in some species are learnt. Then, it is the tendency to learn which is inherited.\n\n The Jackdaw of Altenberg \nKonrad Lorenz noticed that when birds sing, they often use a lot of their regular calls as part of the song. Lorenz had a flock of jackdaws which were scattered during World War II. One day, an old bird returned. For many months she sat on the chimney singing her song, but in the song she kept making the call which Lorenz knew meant "Come home! Come home!" One day, to the great surprise of Lorenz, a male bird flew from a passing flock and joined her on the chimney. Lorenz was sure that it was her long-lost "husband" who had found his way home at last.\n\n Evolution and taxonomy \n\nPalaeontologists have found some exceptional places (lagerstätten) where fossils of early birds are found. The preservation is so good that on the best examples impressions of their feathers can be seen, and sometimes even the remains of meals they have eaten. From these remains we know that birds evolved from small carnivorous dinosaurs (theropods) in the Jurassic period. They radiated into a huge variety in the Lower Cretaceous. At the same time, their direct competitors, the pterosaurs, dwindled in numbers and variety, and became extinct at the end of the Mesozoic.\n\nBirds are classified by taxonomists as \'Aves\' (Avialae). Birds are the only living descendants of dinosaurs (strictly speaking, they are dinosaurs). Birds and Crocodilia are the only living members of the once-dominant Archosaur reptiles.\n\n Definition \nThe class Aves is was defined (1990) as all the descendants of the most recent common ancestor of modern birds and Archaeopteryx lithographica. But Archaeopteryx is almost certainly not the ancestor of modern birds. The transition to flight happened a number of times. The researchers offered four definitions. Birds can be: \nAll archosaurs closer to birds than crocodiles (Avemetatarsalia).\nAdvanced archosaurs with feathers (Avofilopluma).\nThose feathered dinosaurs that fly (or Avialae)\nAves can mean the last common ancestor of all living birds and all of its descendants (a "crown group", in this sense synonymous with Neornithes).\n\n The first bird-like creatures Archaeopteryx, from the Upper Jurassic some 150–145 million years ago (mya), was for a long time the earliest known bird which could fly. It is famous, because it was one of the first important fossils found after Charles Darwin published his ideas about evolution in the 19th century. By modern standards, Archaeopteryx could not fly very well. Other early fossil birds are, for example, Confuciusornis, Anchiornis huxlei and other Paraves.\n\nMany fossils of early birds and small dinosaurs have been discovered in the Liaoning Province of Northeast China. These include Anchiornis huxlei, from about 160 mya. The fossils show that most small theropod dinosaurs had feathers. These deposits have preserved them so well that the impressions of their feathers can be clearly seen. This leads us to think that feathers evolved first as heat insulation and only later for flight. The origin of birds lies in these small feathered dinosaurs.\n\nPalaeontologists now agree that birds are included in Maniraptora group of dinosaurs. This explains why we say that birds are living dinosaurs.\n\n Evolution of modern birds \nA leading authority says "Most living birds have fossil representatives in the Cenozoic"... "Key problems remain in understanding bird phylogeny... we seem to understand as little about the relationships among living birds as among Cretaceous birds".\n\n Origin of birds\n Paraves\n\nBirds and people \n\nSome birds are eaten as food. Most usually it is the chicken and its eggs, but people often also eat geese, pheasants, turkeys and ducks. Other birds are sometimes eaten are: emus, ostriches, pigeons, grouse, quails, doves, woodcocks and even songbirds. Some species have died out because they have been hunted for food, for example the dodo and the passenger pigeon.\n\nMany species have learned how to get food from people. The number of birds of these species has grown because of it. Seagulls and crows find food from garbage dumps. The feral pigeon (Columba livia), sparrows (Passer domesticus and starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) live in large numbers in towns and cities all over the world.\n\nSometimes people also use working birds. For example, homing pigeons carry messages. Nowadays people sometimes race them for sport. People also use falcons for hunting, and cormorants for fishing. In the past, people in mines often used a canary to see if there were bad gas methane in the air.\n\nPeople often have colorful birds such as parrots and mynahs as pets. These intelligent birds are popular because they can copy human talking. Because of this, some people trap birds and take them to other countries to sell. This is not usually allowed these days. Most pet birds are specially bred and are sold in pet shops.\n\nPeople can catch some bird diseases, for example: psittacosis, salmonellosis, campylobacteriosis, Newcastle\'s disease, mycobacteriosis, influenza, giardiasis and cryptosporiadiosis. In 2005, there was an epidemic of bird influenza spreading through some parts of the world, often called avian flu.\n\nSome people have birdboxes in their gardens to give birds a place to nest and bird tables where birds can get food and water in very cold or very dry weather. This lets people see some small birds close up which are normally hidden away in bushes and trees.\n\nBird orders \nThe following is a listing of all bird orders:\n Infraclass Palaeognathae\n Superorder Struthionimorphae\n Struthioniformes\n Superorder Notopalaeognathae\n Rheiformes\n Tinamiformes\n Casuariiformes\n Apterygiformes\n Infraclass Neognathae\n Superorder Galloanserae\n Galliformes\n Anseriformes\n Superorder Neoaves\n Phoenicopteriformes\n Podicipediformes\n Columbiformes\n Mesitornithiformes\n Pteroclidiformes\n Apodiformes\n Caprimulgiformes\n Cuculiformes\n Otidiformes\n Musophagiformes\n Opisthocomiformes\n Gruiformes\n Charadriiformes\n Gaviiformes\n Procellariiformes\n Sphenisciformes\n Ciconiiformes\n Suliformes\n Pelecaniformes\n Eurypygiformes\n Phaethontiformes\n Cathartiformes\n Accipitriformes\n Strigiformes\n Coliiformes\n Leptosomiformes\n Trogoniformes\n Bucerotiformes\n Coraciiformes\n Piciformes\n Cariamiformes\n Falconiformes\n Psittaciformes\n Passeriformes\n\nBird population decreasing\nA report produced by BirdLife International every five years measures the population of birds worldwide.

It includes the time from prehistory to the present day.  It is different from natural history.\n\nDevelopment of the human species \n\nModern human beings are called Homo sapiens (\'wise man\'). They have existed for about 250,000 years. Biologists believe that Homo sapiens evolved in Africa.\n\nHomo sapiens, lived at the same time as  other species of human. These included Homo erectus (\'standing man\') and Homo neanderthalensis (\'man from Neanderthal\'). The theory of human evolution says that modern humans, Neanderthals, and Homo erectus slowly developed from other earlier species of human-like creatures.\n\nHomo neanderthalensis are the first humans scientists discovered which were not Homo sapiens. Homo neanderthalensis are usually called Neanderthal Man. They were discovered when the cranium of a skull was found in the Neanderthal Valley in 1856. It was different from a modern human skull so scientists believed it was from a new species. Entire Neanderthal skeletons have been found in other places since then. When ancient stone tools are found, their style often shows whether they were made by Homo sapiens or Neanderthals (see Palaeolithic). Neanderthals existed before modern humans. They knew how to use tools and fire.\n\nScientists believe that Homo sapiens spread from Africa to all other parts of the world, replacing Homo neanderthalensis in Europe and Homo erectus in Asia. By the end of the Stone Age, it is believed that Homo sapiens were the only type of humans left.\n\nInfluence of climate \n\nClimate is the normal weather in a place. It changes from one part of the world to another. Some areas are hot all year, and some are cold all year. Some areas are dry all year, and others are wet all year. Most areas have climates that are warmer in the summer and cooler in the winter.  Most parts of the world get rain at some times of the year and do not get rain at other times of the year. Some parts of the world have oceanic climates and others have alpine climates.\n\nClimate affects what food people eat. This is because climate affects what foods can grow.  If one food is easier to grow, people usually eat that food more often than other foods. Foods that people eat more of than other foods are called staple foods.  Staple foods are usually grains or vegetables because they are easy to grow.  Wheat, maize, millet, rice, oats, rye, potatoes, yams, breadfruit and beans are examples of different staple foods from around the world.\n\nClimate can affect the way people live in many other ways. It affects the types of animals that can live in any area, which affect the types of meats that are available to eat.\nClimate also affects the buildings that people make, the clothes that they wear and the way that they travel.\n\nClimate change \n\nThe climate on earth has not stayed the same through human history. There are long periods of time when it is generally warmer, and there are long periods of time when it is generally colder. When it is generally colder, there is more ice on the poles of the planet. A cold period is called an ice age. There have been many ice ages in the history of the earth. Two have affected humans.\n\nFrom 70,000 to around 10,000 years ago there was a big ice age which affected humans and the way that they lived. Between 1600\xa0AD and 1900\xa0AD there was a period called the Little Ice Age when the climate was a little bit colder than usual.\n\nPrehistory \n\nThe word "Prehistory" means "before history".  It is used for the long period of time before humans began to write about their lives.  This time is divided into two main ages: the Paleolithic Age (or Early Stone Age) and the Neolithic Age  (or late Stone Age).  The two ages did not start and end at the same time everywhere.  A place moved from one age to another depending on when people changed their technology.\n\nThe end of prehistory varies from one place to another. It depends on the date when that place began to use writing. In Egypt the first written documents date from around 3200\xa0BC. In Australia the first written records date from 1788 and in New Guinea from about 1900.\n\nPaleolithic Era \n\nThe Paleolithic Era is by far the longest age of humanity\'s time, about 99% of human history. The Paleolithic Age started about 2.6  million years ago and ended around 10,000\xa0BC. The age began when hominids (early humans) started to use stones as tools for bashing, cutting and scraping. The age ended when humans began to plant crops and have other types of agriculture. In some areas, such as Western Europe, the way that people lived was affected by the Ice age. In these places, people moved towards agriculture quicker than in warmer places where there was always lots of food to gather. Their culture is sometimes called the Mesolithic Era (Middle Stone Age).\n\nDuring the Paleolithic Era humans grouped together in small bands. They lived by gathering plants and hunting wild animals. This way of living is called a "hunter-gatherer society".  People hunted small burrowing animals like rabbits, as well as birds and herds of animals like deer and cattle.  They also gathered plants to eat, including grains. Grain often grows on grasslands where herds of grass-eating animals are found.  People also gathered root vegetables, green vegetables, beans, fruit, seeds, berries, nuts, eggs, insects and small reptiles.\n\nMany Paleolithic bands were nomadic. They moved from place to place as the weather changed. They followed herds of animals that they hunted from their winter feeding places to their summer feeding places. If there was a drought,flood, or some other disaster, the herds and the people might haved moved a long distance, looking for food.  During the "Ice Age" a lot of the water on Earth turned to ice.  This made sea much lower than it is now.  People were able to walk through Beringia from Siberia to Alaska.  Bands of Homo sapiens ( another word for people) travelled to that area from Asia. At that time there were rich grasslands with many large animals that are now extinct. It is believed that many groups of people travelled there over a long time and later spread to other parts of America, as the weather changed.\n\nPaleolithic people used stone tools. Sometimes a stone tool was just a rock. It might have been useful for smashing a shell or an animal\'s skull, or for grinding grain on another rock. Other tools were made by breaking rocks to make a sharp edge. The next development in stone tool making was to chip all the edges of a rock so that it made a pointed shape, useful for a spearhead, or arrow tip. Some stone tools are carefully "flaked" at the edges to make them sharp, and symmetrically shaped. Paleolithic people also used tools of wood and bone. They probably also used leather and vegetable fibers but these have not lasted from that time. Paleolithic people also knew how to make fire which they used for warmth and cooking.\n\nThe Neolithic\n\nSettling down \n\nIn the Paleolithic Era there were many different human species. According to current research, only the modern human reached the Neolithic Era.\n\nThe Neolithic era was marked by changes in society. During the Neolithic era, people started to settle down. They developed agriculture and domesticated animals, both of which took a very long time. Because of these two things, people did not have to migrate as much any more. Villages could grow to much larger sizes than before. Over time, villages fought and spread their control over larger areas and some became civilisations. During this time, humankind also developed further intellectually, militarily and spiritually.\n\nWhen humans started to grow crops and domesticate certain animals such as dogs, goats, sheep, and cattle;  their societies changed. Because people now grew crops and raised livestock, they started to stay in the same place and build permanent settlements. In most places, this happened between 10,000 and 12,000 years ago. Their diet also changed. People ate more cereals and vegetables. They started to keep extra foods and seeds for later. In some years there were surpluses (extras) that could be traded for other goods.\n\nThese changes happened independently in many parts of the world. They did not happen in the same order though. For example, the earliest farming societies in the Near East did not use pottery. No one is sure if Britain had agriculture, or if permanent villages existed there at all. Early Japanese societies used pottery before developing agriculture.\n\nVere Gordon Childe gave the name Neolithic Revolution to this process in the 1920s. He thought that it was as important as the Industrial Revolution (which happened in the 18th and 19th century).\n\nAncient history – the early civilizations \n\nAncient history was the time from the development of writing to the fall of the Roman Empire. The fall of the Roman Empire caused chaos in Europe, leading to the Middle Ages (also called the Dark Ages or the Age of Faith).\n\nThe first civilizations were built along major river systems. These civilizations are called river valley civilizations. River valley civilizations were the most powerful civilizations in this time period because water was needed to have an agricultural society.\n\nThese civilizations were similar in that:\n They developed along river systems\n They had polytheistic religions\n They used writing systems\n\nMiddle East and North Africa\n\nSumer \n\nSumer was the world\'s first known ancient civilization. The Sumerians took over the fertile crescent region of Mesopotamia around 3300 BCE. They grew crops on the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. By 3000 BCE, many cities had been built in parts of Sumerian Mesopotamia. They formed independently and each had their own government. They were called city-states and often fought with each other.\n\nA surplus in food led to a Division of labour. This means that some people were able to stop growing crops and do other jobs, since enough crops were already grown. This brought a split in society. Today, such a split is called social pyramid. In a social pyramid, people are grouped into social classes based on their wealth and power. In Sumer, the king, priests, and government officials were at the top of the social pyramid. Below them were the artisans, merchants, farmers, and fishers. At the bottom of the pyramid were slaves. Slaves were often prisoners of war, criminals, or people working to pay off debt.\n\nThe Sumerians created the world\'s first system of writing; it was called cuneiform. The oldest versions of one of the world\'s first literary works, the Epic of Gilgamesh, go back to this time. In Sumer, only the sons of the rich and powerful learned how to read and write. They went to a school called edubba. Only the boys who went to edubba could become scribes.\n\nThe Sumerians also invented sun-dried bricks, the wheel, the ox plow, and were skilled at making pottery. They are also thought to have invented the sailboat.\n\nAfter the Sumerians, the civilizations of Babylonia and then Assyria rose to power in Mesopotamia.\n\nBabylonia had a king named Hammurabi. He is famous for the Codex Hammurabi.\n\nJust to the east was the long-lasting civilization of Elam.\n\nAncient Egypt \n\nAncient Egypt grew along the Nile river. It was created around 3500\xa0BC. It was most powerful in the second millennium BC. When it was its biggest, it went all the way from the Nile delta to a mountain called Jebel Barkal in Sudan. It probably ended at about 30\xa0BC when the country was invaded by the Roman Empire.\n\nThe society of ancient Egypt depended on a balance of natural and human resources, especially the irrigation of the Nile Valley so that Egyptians could grow crops.\n\nThere was a great difference between classes in this society. Most of the people were farmers but they did not own the agricultural products they produced. These were property of the state, temple, or noble family that owned the land. There was slavery, but it is not clear how it was practiced.\nThe Religion of Ancient Egypt encouraged people to respect their rulers and their past.\n\nThe Egyptians are known for writing in hieroglyphs, building the famous pyramids, and building other sorts of tombs and big temples and for their military.\n\nThe religion of Judaism formed about 1500 BCE around the Egyptian and Babylonian civilizations.\n\nMid and Eastern Asia\n\nAncient China \n\nChina began as city-states in the Yellow River valley. The Shang Dynasty (商朝) was the first dynasty of Ancient China.Turtle shells with writing on them have been carbon dated to about 1500\xa0BC.\n\nThe Zhou Dynasty came after the Shang Dynasty. Kong Fuzi and Laozi lived at the end of the Zhou Dynasty. They were the greatest Chinese philosophers. They founded new philosophies, or ways of thinking. Confucius founded Confucianism and Laozi founded Daoism.\n\nAfter the Zhou Dynasty came the Warring States Period.\n\nThe Qin (秦) dynasty came after the Warring States Period. The Qin emperor Qin Shi Huang created the first centralized state in China in 221\xa0BC. It was based on his based on his political philosophy of legalism. He made everyone write the same way. He fought against Confucianism. He also started building what would later become the Great Wall.\n\nIn 202\xa0BC the Han Dynasty took over. It was about as strong as the Roman Empire. Towards the end of the Han Dynasty,  Buddhism became influential in China.\n\nAncient India/Pakistan \n\nThe Indus Valley Civilization lasted from about 2600\xa0BC to 1900\xa0BC. It was the first urban civilization on the subcontinent. It was centered on the Indus River and its tributaries. The civilization is famous for its brick cities that had road-side drainage systems and multi-storied houses.\n\nThe Maurya dynasty started in 321 BCE. This was the first time most of the Indian subcontinent was united under a single government. Ashoka the Great was a famous Mauryan emperor. When he started ruling, he sought to expand his empire, but then followed a policy of ahimsa (non-violence) after converting to Buddhism. He wrote about this in the Edicts of Ashoka. The Edicts of Ashoka are the oldest historical documents from India that still exist. While Ashoka ruled, Buddhist ideals spread across all of East Asia and South-East Asia.\n\nThe Gupta dynasty ruled from around 320 to 550\xa0AD. The Gupta Empire included only Central India, and the area east of current day Bangladesh. This empire never included present-day Pakistan to the west. Gupta society was ordered in accordance with Hindu beliefs. Historians place the Gupta dynasty alongside with the Han Dynasty, Tang Dynasty and Roman Empire as a model of a classical civilization.\n\nThe Americas\n\nAncient Maya \n\nThe Maya civilization is a civilization that started in Central America. They lived mostly on the Yucatán Peninsula in what is now known as Mexico, but also Honduras, Belize and Guatemala. They were the only known civilization of pre-Columbian America to have a fully developed written language. They also made great achievements in art and architecture and had a very advanced system of mathematics and astronomy.\n\nThe area where the Maya civilization developed was inhabited from around the 10th millennium BC. The first Maya settlements were built there in about 1800\xa0BC, in the Soconusco region. This is in the modern-day state of Chiapas in Mexico, on the Pacific Ocean. Today, this is called the Early Preclassic period. At the time, humans began to settle down permanently. They started to grow livestock. Pottery and small clay figures were made. They constructed simple burial mounds. Later they developed these mounds into step pyramids. There were other civilizations around, especially in the north, such as the Olmec, the Mixe-Zoque, and Zapotec civilizations. These people mostly lived in the area of the modern-day state Oaxaca. The exact borders of the Maya empire in the north are unclear. There were probably areas where Maya culture overlapped with other cultures. Many of the earliest significant inscriptions and buildings appeared in this overlapping zone. These cultures and the Maya probably influenced one another.\n\nAustralia \nThere has been a long history of contact between Papuan peoples of the Papua New Guinea and the Aboriginal people. Aboriginal people seem to have lived a long time in the same environment as the now extinct Australian megafauna. Stories about that are told in the oral culture of many Aboriginal groups.\n\nAncient Europe\n\nHallstatt culture \n\nThe Hallstatt era is named after the city Hallstatt in Austria, where the first artifacts were found. It lasted from about 1200\xa0BC to about 275\xa0BC. There were different periods, which today are mainly told apart by the kinds of brooches used at the time. These brooches changed rather rapidly, and can therefore give us good guesses at to what time they came from. Hallstatt culture sites have been found in the east of France, in Switzerland, in the south of Germany, in Austria, in Slovenia and Croatia, northwestern Hungary, southwestern Slovakia and southern Moravia. The culture can be divided into an eastern and a western one quite easily; the dividing line runs through the Czech Republic, and Austria, between longitudes 14 and 15 degrees east.\n\nIn this time, the social structure developed into a hierarchy. This can be documented by various things that were added to graves. In the Bronze Age, people used to live in big settlements. As iron became available, trade routes changed. A new richer class evolved. Unlike before, these richer class people liked to live in big houses in the countryside, as a demonstration of their wealth. Funerals also changed, from cremation burials, to burials with stone coffins. The new upper class used their wealth for import goods, mostly from the Mediterranean.\n\nLa Tène culture \n\nThe La Tène culture is a culture that lasted from about 500\xa0BC to about 100\xa0AD. It is named after the city of La Tène (today, Marin-Epagnier, next to Neuchâtel). It was influenced a lot by the Roman and Greek cultures. There are two sources for this:\n Objects found there\n Romans and Greeks came in contact with the culture. They called them Celts, usually. They wrote about them. The most important work about them was written by Julius Caesar. It is called On the Gallic War (De bello gallico).\n\nThe Celts basically lived in clans. Each clan was headed by a leader, which came from the  Druids or the Bards. Women were much better off than with the Romans, they were almost equal to men. There was polygamy and polyandry (A man could have several women, a woman could have several men).\n\nIllyria \n\nIllyria  is the part of west-south Balkan Peninsula populated by Illyrians whose descendants are Albanians.\nIllyrians lived in tribunes such as Epirus, Dardania, Taulantia etc.\nThey had their own language, the Illyrian language that was different from the Greek language and Latin.\nAt the year 1000\xa0BC the population of Illyria is estimated to be around 500,000.\n\nAncient Greece \n\nWhat is known today as Ancient Greece is a very important period in history. Most people agree that it came after the Minoan and Mycenaean civilizations. It ended when the Romans invaded Greece, in 146\xa0BC. Greek culture had a very powerful influence on later civilizations, especially the Romans. The Greeks developed what is now called a city-state, or a polis. There were many polises. Some of the more important ones were Athens, Sparta, Corinth and Thebes. The word politics comes from there. It literally means: things that are about the polis. Greek cities did not have much contact with each other, because of the mountains and many islands Greece is made up of. When a city no longer had enough food to care for all its citizens, some people were sent out to set up a new city. This was called a colony. Each city was independent, and ruled by someone within that city. Colonies also looked to the city where they originally came from for guidance.\n\nWhen Greece went to war (for example against the Persian Empire), there was an alliance of such city states, against the Persians. There were also many wars between different city states.\n\nThere were many artists and philosophers who lived in that period. Most of them are still important for philosophy today. A well-known artist was Homer. He wrote epics about the war against the Trojans, and the early history of Greece. Other well-known artists were Aristophanes and Sappho. Well-known philosophers include Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. A well known mathematician of the time was Euclid. Statesmen of the time were Pericles and Alexander the Great.\n\nAncient Rome \n\nAncient Rome was a civilization that started in modern-day Italy, in the 8th Century before Christ. The civilization lasted for 12 centuries. It ended, when Mehmed II conquered Constantinople, on May 29, 1453. According to legend, the Roman civilization was founded by Romulus and Remus, in the year 753\xa0BC. The Roman Empire developed in wars against Carthage and the Seleucid Empire. Julius Caesar conquered Gaul, modern France, and Augustus ended the Roman republic by becoming emperor. At its biggest extent, the empire covered all of the Mediterranean. Rome became so big, because it led war against other nations and then assimilated their culture.\n\nSplit of the Empire into East and West \nIn 293, Diocletian organized a separate administration of the western and the eastern part of the empire. The capital of the western part was Rome, the capital of the eastern part was Constantinople. Constantine I was the first to stop discrimination against Christians (313). Christianity became state religion under the reign of Theodosius I.\n\nThe western part of the empire had many problems with barbarians. In the 5th century, the Huns migrated westwards. This meant that the Visigoths moved into the empire, to seek protection. Rome was sacked by barbarians multiple times. On September 4, 476, the Germanic chief Odoacer forced the last Roman emperor in the west, Romulus Augustus, to quit. After about 1200 years, the rule of Rome in the West came to an end.\n\nThe eastern part had similar problems. Justinian I managed to conquer parts of North Africa and Italy. Shortly after he died, all that was left were parts of Southern Italy, and Sicily. In the east, the empire was threatened by the Sassanid Empire.\n\nNew departures and continuity \nAfter the fall of Western Rome, the Germanic tribes that took over tried to learn from Roman civilization, but much was forgotten and up to the Renaissance not many achievements happened in Europe. But with the rise of Islam, many changes happened during the Islamic Golden Age. The Greek and Roman traditions were kept and further development took place. The Chinese civilization had a Golden Age during the Tang period, when their capital was the biggest in the world. During the Renaissance, Europe developed and made great advancements in many areas as well.\n\nAsia\n\nMiddle East – Islamic rise, Byzantine decline \n\nIn Arabia, Muhammad founded Islam in 632.  His followers rapidly conquered territories in Syria and Egypt.  They soon were a danger to the Byzantine Empire.  In the 8th and 9th centuries, the Byzantine Empire stopped Islamic expansion and reconquered some lost territories.  In 1000 A.D. the eastern Empire was at its height: Basileios II reconquered Bulgaria and Armenia.  Culture and trade flourished.  In 1071 the Battle of Manzikert led the empire into a dramatic decline.  For the Byzantine Empire this meant centuries of civil wars and Turkic invasions.  The Muslim caliphate had an Golden Age under the Abbasids.\n\nTheir power forced Emperor Alexius I Comnenus of the Byzantine Empire to send a call for help to the West in 1095.  The West sent the Crusades.  These eventually led to the Sack of Constantinople in the Fourth Crusade in 1204.  Because of this, what was left of the Empire broke into successor states.  The winner of these disputes was that of Nicaea.  After Constantinople was again conquered by imperial forces, the empire was little more than a Greek state on the Aegean coast.  The Eastern Empire came to an end when Mehmed II conquered Constantinople on May 29, 1453.  The Ottoman Empire took its place and from 1400 to 1600 was the most powerful empire in the Middle East and ruled at the southern and eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nChina \nThe Tang Dynasty (618–907), with its capital at Chang\'an (today Xi\'an), was the biggest city in the world at the time and is considered by historians as a high point in Chinese civilization as well as a golden age of cosmopolitan culture. The Ming Dynasty ruled from 1368 to 1644. The Ming built a vast army and navy.\n\nIndia \nFrom around the 6th–7th century. In South India, Chola kings ruled Tamil Nadu, and Chera kings ruled Kerala. They had trading relationships with the Roman Empire to the west and Southeast Asia to the east. In north India, Rajputs ruled in many kingdoms.\n\nIn 1336, two brothers named Harihara I and Bukka founded the Vijayanagara Empire in an area which is now in the Karnataka state of India. The most famous king of this empire was Krishnadevaraya. In 1565, rulers of this empire were defeated in a battle. But the empire continued for about the next one hundred years.\nNorthern India was ruled by Islamic sultans.\n\nJapan \nThe Heian Period in Japan is famous for its art, poetry and literature. The writing system, Kana, was developed. It was followed by the feudal period (1185–1853) during which samurai and daimyos were the leading figures and the shogun the real monarch whereas the tennō had only a role as religious head. Between the years 1272 and 1281 the Mongols tried to invade but were driven out by the Japanese.\nIn 1542, a Portuguese ship reached Japan. Japanese learned about guns and firearms from them.\n\nMongols \nGenghis Khan in 1209 brought together the Mongol tribes and founded the Mongol Empire, one of the largest land empires in history. Later Kublai Khan would go on to expand the empire and found the Mongol-ruled Yuan Dynasty of China. The empire later broke into several empires, all of which were later destroyed.\n\nEuropean Middle Ages \n\nThe Middle Ages was the time from the fall of the Roman empire until the middle of the 15th century. From 500 to about 800 there was some decline compared with the Roman civilization. European villages were often destroyed and looted by barbarians such as the Vikings. During the High Middle Ages magnificent castles and large churches called cathedrals were built and important works of literature were written. In the later Middle Ages, there was a plague called the Black Death. The Black Death killed one-third to one-half of Europe\'s population.\n\nA system called feudalism was a very important part of the Middle Ages. In this system, the king was at the top of the social pyramid. The king gave land to the lord in exchange for loyalty. The lords were the next in the pyramid. The lords gave land (called a fief) to knights in exchange for loyalty and protection. The knights came next in the pyramid. Peasants were not part of the feudal system because they did not give or receive land. They worked on a lord\'s manor in exchange for protection.\n\nThe Crusades were also fought during the Middle Ages. There is a theory that says the Crusades helped end the Middle Ages along with the Black Death, increased trade and better farming technology.\n\nRenaissance \n\nThe Renaissance started in Italy. Renaissance is a French word meaning "rebirth". The Renaissance meant that people learned from the ancient Greek and Roman or "classical" cultures that had been forgotten for some time. Artists learned from classical paintings and sculptures. So they reinvented perspective and the art of free standing realistic sculptures that had been characteristic in Greek and Roman art. Some famous Renaissance artists are Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael. The Gutenberg printing press, invented by Johannes Gutenberg, was also developed during this time.\n\nThe Renaissance was also a time of great achievements in science (Galileo Galilei, Francis Bacon), philosophy (Thomas More) and literature (Dante Alighieri, William Shakespeare).\n\nAmerica\n\nMaya civilization (classical period) \n\nWhat is known as the classical period lasted from about 250 to about 900. During this time, many monuments were constructed. There are also many big inscriptions from then. In this period, the Maya moved to building large cities. This is known as urbanism. Many important intellectual and artistic developments happened in an area that is known as the southern lowlands.\n\nLike the Ancient Greek, the Maya civilization was made of many independent city-states. Agriculture was important around these city states like Tikal and Copán.\nThe most important monuments are the pyramids they built in their religious centers and the palaces of their rulers. The palace at Cancuén is the largest in the Maya area. There are no pyramids in the area of the palace. Other important things the archaeologists found include the carved stone slabs usually called stelae (the Maya called them tetun, or "tree-stones"). These slabs show rulers along with hieroglyphic texts describing their genealogy, military victories, and other accomplishments. In North America, they made Mississipian culture with the largest land field from around 800 CE to 1600.\n\nTrade with other civilizations \nThe Maya also had trade routes that ran over long distances. They traded with many of the other Mesoamerican cultures, such as Teotihuacan, the Zapotec, and other groups in central and gulf-coast Mexico. They also traded with non-Mesoamerican groups, that were farther away. Archaeologists have found gold from Panama in the Sacred Cenote of Chichen Itza.\n\nImportant trade goods were cacao, salt, sea shells, jade and obsidian.\n\nSudden collapse \nIn the 8th and 9th century, the cities in the southern lowlands had problems, and declined. At the same time, the Maya stopped making big monuments and inscriptions. Shortly afterwards, these cities were abandoned. Currently, archaeologists are not sure why this happened. There are different theories. Either ecological factors played a role in this, or the cause of this abandonment was not related to the environment.\n\nPost-classical period and decline \n\nIn the north, development went on, form the 10th to about the 16th century. The influences from the outside left more traces in the Maya culture at that time. Some of the important sites in this era were Chichen Itza, Uxmal, and Coba. At some point, the ruling dynasties of Chichen and Uxmal declined. Afterwards, Mayapan ruled all of Yucatán until a revolt in 1450. The area then degenerated into competing city-states until the Yucatán was conquered by the Spanish.\n\nBy 1250, there developed other city-states. The Itza maintained their capital at Tayasal. It ruled over an area extending across the Peten Lakes region, including the community of Ekckixil on Lake Quexil. Postclassic Maya states also survived in the southern highlands. One of the Maya kingdoms in this area is responsible for the best-known Maya work of historiography and mythology, the Popol Vuh.\n\nThe Spanish started to conquer Maya lands. This took them much longer than with the Inca or Aztecs, because there was no capital city. This meant that when they had conquered one city, this had little influence on the whole empire. The last Maya states were finally subdued in 1697.\n\nThe Maya people did not disappear though. There are still about 6 million of them. Some are well-integrated, others continue speak one of the Maya languages and uphold their cultural heritage.\n\nThe Aztecs \n\nThe Aztecs built an empire in Central America, mainly in Mexico. The empire lasted from the 14th to the 16th century. They spoke the Nahuatl language. Their capital was Tenochtitlan. It was built on islands in a lake. Tenochtitlan was one of the greatest cities of the world in that time.\n\nThe Aztecs believed in polytheism. Quetzalcoatl (feathered snake), Huitzilopochtli (hummingbird of the south) and Tezcatlipoca (smoking mirror) were the most important Gods. Sometimes the Aztecs killed humans to please their gods. Between 1519 and 1521 the Spanish leader Hernán Cortés defeated the Aztecs and took their empire. Some Aztecs did not want to fight against the soldiers of Cortés, because they thought they were Gods.\n\nToday many Mexicans have Aztec and other Native American forefathers. People still use Aztec symbols in Mexico. On the Mexican flag there is a picture of an eagle on a cactus with a snake in its mouth. This was an Aztec symbol. Also the name Mexico is an Aztec word.\n\nThe Aztecs ate a lot of plants and vegetables that could be grown easily in the Mexico area. The main food that they ate was corn, which they called maize. Another food that they ate was squash.\n\nAztecs also had a lot of harsh punishments for certain crimes. For the following crimes the punishment was death: adultery, wearing cotton clothes (cotton clothes were only for the nobles), cutting down a living tree, moving a field boundary making your land bigger, making someone else\'s smaller, major theft and treason.\n\nThe Incas \n\nThe Incas were a civilized empire in western South America. The Incas are called a "pre-Columbian" empire. This means that their country was here before Christopher Columbus. They ruled parts of South America around what is now Peru for a little over 100 years, until the Spanish invasion in the 16th century.\n\nThe Incan empire or , meaning four regions in Quechua, only lasted for about 100 years as the arrival of the Spaniards in 1532 conquered them. Their main language was Quechua, but as the Incas were basically made up of many different groups there were probably many other different languages.\n\nTheir capital was in the city of Cusco, or Qosqo, in what is now southern Peru.\n\nManco Capac founded the first Inca state around 1200. It covered the area around Cusco. In the 1400s, Pachacuti began to absorb other people in the Andes. The expansion of the Inca Empire had started. The Inca Empire would become the biggest empire in the Americas before Columbus.\n\nIn 1532, the civil war ended. The brothers Huascar and Atahualpa, fought for who would succeed their father. During this time, the Spanish conquerors took possession of the Inca territory. They were led by Francisco Pizarro. In the following years the conquistadors managed to extend their power over the whole Andean region. They suppressed successive Inca rebellions until the establishment of the Viceroyalty of Perú in 1542 and the fall of the resistance of the last Incas of Vilcabamba in 1572. The Inca civilization ends at that time, but many cultural traditions remain in some ethnic groups as Quechuas and Aymara people.\n\nAfrica \n\nAncient Egypt and Carthage are well known civilizations of ancient Africa. But because there are not many written sources in large parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, the history of Africa is not easy to write about. But with new techniques such as the recording of oral history, historical linguistics and archeology knowledge has improved, not only for the empires and kingdoms of Ethiopia, Ghana, Mali, Nubia, Kush and Kerma.\n\nGlobalization\n\nFrom colonialization to imperialism\n\nThe rise of Europe\n\nColonization \n\nColonization happened after Christopher Columbus came to the Americas. European countries such as England, France, and Spain built colonies in the Americas. These settlers fought the Native Americans to take over their land. The colonisation of the Americas was the beginning of modern times.\n\nAn important part about contact with the Americas was the Columbian Exchange The Columbian Exchange brought new foods, ideas, and diseases to the Old World and New World, changing the way people lived. Historians believe that almost everyone as far as Asia was affected in some way by the Columbian Exchange.\n\nReformation and Counter-Reformation \nProtestant Reformation started with Martin Luther and the posting of the 95 theses on the door of the castle church in Wittenberg, Germany. At first he protested against corruption such as simony or the sale of indulgences. But then it became clear that he had different ideas about the church doctrine. He thought that Christians should only read the Bible to find out what God wants from them. That meant that they did not need priests (see: Five solas). The three most important traditions that came directly from the Protestant Reformation were the Lutheran, Reformed (Calvinist, Presbyterian, etc.), and Anglican traditions.\n\nThe Counter-Reformation, or Catholic Reformation, was the Catholic Church fighting the Protestant Reformation. New religious orders, such as the Jesuits were founded and missionaries sent around the world. Decisions were taken at the Council of Trent (1545–1563).\n\nIndustrial revolution \nThe Industrial Revolution started in Great Britain. It brought many advances in the way goods were produced. These advances allowed people to produce much more than they needed for living. The early British Empire split as its colonies in America revolted to establish a representative government.\n\nFrom nationalism to imperialism \nThe French Revolution lead to  massive political change in continental Europe, as people following the ideas of Enlightenment asked for human rights with the slogan liberté, egalité, fraternité (liberty, equality, fraternity). That led to the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, but also to terror and the execution of King Louis XVI. The French leader, Napoleon Bonaparte, conquered and changed Europe through war up to 1815. As more and more small property holders were granted the vote, in France and the UK, socialist and trade union activity developed and revolution gripped Europe in 1848. The last vestiges of serfdom were abolished in Austria-Hungary in 1848. Russian serfdom was abolished in 1861. The Balkan nations began to regain their independence from the Ottoman Empire. After the Franco-Prussian War, Italy and Germany became unified in 1870 and 1871. Conflict spread across the globe, in a chase for empires. The search for a "place in the sun" ended with the outbreak of World War I. In the desperation of war, the Russian Revolution promised the people "peace, bread and land". The defeat of Germany came at the price of economic destruction, which was written down in the Treaty of Versailles.\n\nAsia\n\nChina – continuity \nFrom 1644 to 1912 the Qing or Manchu Dynasty ruled China. The dynasty was founded by the Manchu clan in northeast China (Manchuria). It expanded into China proper and its surrounding territories, establishing the Empire of the Great Qing.\nIts military power weakened during the 1800s, and faced with international pressure, massive rebellions and defeats in wars, the Qing Dynasty declined after the mid-19th century. It was overthrown in 1912.\n\nJapan \nDuring the Edo period, Japan had many small rulers. There were about 200 of them, called the daimyo. Out of them, the Tokugawa clan was most powerful. They ruled from a place called Edo. This place was around the present day’s Tokyo. For fifteen generations they were the most powerful clan in Japan.\n\nBeginning from the early 17th century, the rulers (known as shogunate) started a policy of seclusion (stopping some people coming in), known as sakoku in Japanese language. They suspected that traders, merchants and missionaries wanted to bring Japan under the control of European powers. Except the Dutch and the Chinese, all foreigners, traders and merchants from other countries, missionaries were no longer allowed into Japan.\n\nStill even during the period of seclusion, Japanese continued to gain information and knowledge about other parts of the world.\nThis policy of seclusion lasted for about 200 years. It ended 1868 with Meiji Restoration, when the emperor took over again and started a lot of reforms.\n\nIndia – Mughal Empire \n\nThe Mughal Empire existed from 1526 to 1857. When it was biggest it ruled most of the Indian subcontinent, then known as Hindustan, and parts of what is now Afghanistan. It was founded by Babur in 1526 and ruled until 1530. Its most important ruler was Akbar (1556–1605). After the death of Aurangjeb (1658–1707), the Mughal Empire became weak. It continued until 1857. By that time, India came under the British Raj.\n\nAmerica \n\nSettlement by the Spanish started the European colonization of the Americas, it meant genocide of the native Indians. The Spanish gained control of most of the Caribbean and conquered the Aztecs. So they founded the Spanish Empire in the New World.\n\nThe first successful English settlements were in North America at Jamestown (Virginia), 1607 (along with its satellite, Bermuda in 1609) and Plymouth (Massachusetts), 1620. The first French settlements were Port Royal (1604) and Quebec City (1608). The Fur Trade soon became the primary business on the continent and as a result transformed the Native Americans lifestyle. Plantation slavery of the West Indies lead to the beginning of the Atlantic slave trade.\n\nRivalry between the European powers created a series of wars on the North American landmass. The American Revolution led to the creation of the United States of America. Spain\'s hold on its colonies weakened till it had to give them independence.\n\nThe United States expanded quickly to the west. At the same time, British built more in Canada.\n\nAfrica \nDuring the 15th century the Portuguese began exploring Africa. At the Guinea coast they built their first fort in 1482.  They started slave trade after the first European contact with America in 1492 to supply settlers from there with workers.  Soon English, Spanish, Dutch, French and Danish merchants also built forts.  But their influence on the inland was minor (except from decimation of population by slave trade) till during the 19th century larger colonies were founded.\n\nTwentieth Century onward \n\nThe 20th century was a very important time in history. New technology and different ideas led to many worldwide changes in the time of just 100 years.\n\nWorld Wars\n\nThe First World War \n\nWorld War I was a war fought from 1914 to 1918. During the time of the war, it was called "The Great War", or "The War to End All Wars". Chemical poisons, tanks, aeroplanes, and bombs were used for the first time.\n\nThere were four main causes of the war:\n Imperialism\n Nationalism\n Alliances\n Militarism\n\nThese were causes that made it likely that a war would start in Europe. The "spark" that started the war was the assassination of the heir to the throne in Austria-Hungary: Archduke Franz Ferdinand by a group of young Serbians. Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia and each country\'s allies then joined the war. This created a bigger conflict which turned into World War I.\n\nEurope divided into two groups of allies: the Central Powers and the Allied Powers (the "Allies"). The Central Powers were made up of Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria. The Allies were made up of Britain, France, Russia, Italy and the United States.\n\nWorld War I was fought on two fronts; the Eastern Front and the Western Front. Trench warfare was commonly used on the Eastern Front.\n\nBecause of a British blockade, Germany began using U-boats, or submarines, to sink British ships. After the sinking of two ships with Americans on board, and the public release of the Zimmermann Note, The U.S. declared war on Germany, joining the Allies.\n\nOn November 11, 1918, Germany signed the armistice, meaning "the laying down of arms", to end the war. After the war ended, the Treaty of Versailles was written and Germany was made to sign it. They had to pay $33 million in reparations (payment for damage).  The influenza pandemic of 1918 spread around the world, killing millions.\n\nAfter the First War \nAfter the war the German Empire, the Russian Empire, the Ottoman Empire and Austrian Empire ended and France and Britain got weaker.\nThe 1920s and 1930s had military-related fascist dictators take control of Italy, Germany, Japan and Spain. They were helped by the Great Depression starting in 1929. When Hitler in 1933 had gained power in Germany he prepared World War II.\n\nThe Second World War \n\nOf all the wars ever fought, World War II involved the most countries and killed the most people. More than 60 million people died, making it the worst disaster of all time. It lasted six years in Europe, from 1939 to 1945.\nIt was fought between the Axis Powers (Germany, Italy and Japan) and the Allied Powers. At first the Axis Powers were successful, but that ended in Europe with the Battle of Stalingrad in 1943 and the invasion in Normandy in 1944. But Hitler was able to pursue his plan to annihilate Jews nearly all over Europe. Today, this plan is called the Holocaust.\nIn the Pacific it ended with the battles of Midway and Guadalcanal. Germany surrendered on May 8. The Soviet invasion of Japan led Japan to surrender on August 15, 1945.\n\nAfter World War II \nAfter World War II the United Nations was founded in the hope that it could solve arguments among nations and keep wars from happening. Communism spread to Central and Eastern Europe, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Romania, Albania, North Vietnam and North Korea. In 1949, China became communist. During the 1950s and 1960s, many third world countries became communist.\n\nThis led to the Cold War, a forty-year argument between the United States, the Soviet Union, and their allies (mainly countries that were members of NATO or the Warsaw Pact). Each country wanted to promote their type of government. The Soviet Union wanted to spread communism, and the United States wanted to spread democracy. People across the world feared a nuclear war because of the tension.\n\nCommunism became less popular when it became clear that it could not promote economic growth as well as Western states and that it was not suited for a reform that allowed freedom of speech for everybody. Therefore, the Soviet Union forced Hungary to give up its reform in 1956, it favored the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961 and it stopped reform in Czechoslovakia in 1968. When in 1988/89 Gorbachev made clear that he would not force the countries of the East block to stick to Communism the Berlin Wall was torn down in 1989 and the Soviet Union collapsed (1991). Then the United States was the only superpower left.\n\nAfter Mao Zedong\'s death China\'s communist party proved that economic reform was possible without political freedom and paved the way for enormous economic growth.\n\nAs the 20th century ended, the European Union began to rise and included former satellite states and even parts of the Soviet Union. States in Asia, Africa and South America tried to copy the European Union.\n\nThe twentieth century was a time of great progress in terms of technology. People began to live longer because of better medicine and medical technology. New communications and transportation technologies connected the world. But these advances also helped cause problems with the environment.\n\nThe last half of the century had smaller wars.  Improved information technology and globalization increased trade and cultural exchange.  Space exploration expanded through the solar system.  The structure of DNA was discovered.\n\nThe same period also raised questions about the end of human history because of global dangers: nuclear weapons, greenhouse effect and other problems in the environment.\n\n21st century \n\nAs the 20th century ended, globalization has continued. During this period, communications with mobile phones and the Internet have expanded, which has led to fundamental social changes in corporation, political, and individuals\' personal lives. Due to the population of growth and industrialization, worldwide resource competition is becoming increasingly highly, especially in India, China and Brazil. The increasing demand on the environmental degradation and global warming.\n\nA new Great Recession affected the world in the late 2000s and the early 2010s, and the COVID-19 pandemic spread in 2020, causing further economic and political disruption. Some scientists referred to this as a "Planetary Phase of Civilization".\n\nRelated pages \n History of Africa\n History of America\n History of Asia\n History of Australia\n History of Europe\n History of the Earth\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading \n \nEnglish translation by Paul G.

## Encode a question with OpenAI embedding model

To perform semantic search, we need to encode queries with the same embedding model used to encode the documents at index time.
In this example, we need to use the `text-embedding-3-small` model.

You'll need your OpenAI [API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) to generate the embeddings.


```python
# Get OpenAI API key
OPENAI_API_KEY = getpass("Enter OpenAI API key")

# Set API key
openai.api_key = OPENAI_API_KEY

# Define model
EMBEDDING_MODEL = "text-embedding-3-small"

# Define question
question = 'Is the Atlantic the biggest ocean in the world?'

# Create embedding
question_embedding = openai.Embedding.create(input=question, model=EMBEDDING_MODEL)

```

## Run semantic search queries

Now we're ready to run queries against our Elasticsearch index using our encoded question. We'll be doing a k-nearest neighbors search, using the Elasticsearch [kNN query](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/knn-search.html) option.

First, we define a small function to pretty print the results.


```python
# Function to pretty print Elasticsearch results

def pretty_response(response):
    for hit in response['hits']['hits']:
        id = hit['_id']
        score = hit['_score']
        title = hit['_source']['title']

    Title: Atlantic Ocean
    Summary: The Atlantic Ocean is the world's second largest ocean.  It covers a total area of about . It covers about 20 percent of the Earth's surface. It is named after the god Atlas from Greek mythology.
    
    Geologic history 
    The Atlantic formed when the Americas moved west from Eurasia and Africa. This began sometime in the Cretaceous period, roughly 135 million years ago. It was part of the break-up of the supercontinent Pangaea.
    
    The east coast of South America is shaped somewhat like the west coast of Africa, and this gave a clue that continents moved over long periods of time (continental drift). The Atlantic Ocean is still growing now, because of sea-floor spreading from the mid-Atlantic Ridge, while the Pacific Ocean is said to be shrinking because the sea floor is folding under itself or subducting into the mantle.
    
    Geography
    The Atlantic Ocean is bounded on the west by North and South America. It connects to the Arctic Ocean through the Denmark Strait, Greenland Sea, Norwegian Sea and Barents Sea. It connects with the Mediterranean Sea through the Strait of Gibraltar.
    
    In the southeast, the Atlantic merges into the Indian Ocean. The 20° East meridian defines its border.
    
    In the southwest, the Drake Passage connects it to the Pacific Ocean. The Panama Canal links the Atlantic and Pacific.
    
    The Atlantic Ocean is second in size to the Pacific. It occupies an area of about . The volume of the Atlantic, along with its adjacent seas (the seas next to it), is 354,700,000 cubic kilometres.
    
    The average depth of the Atlantic, along with its adjacent seas, is . The greatest depth is Milwaukee Deep near Puerto Rico, where the Ocean is  deep.
    
    Gulf Stream 
    The Atlantic Ocean has important ocean currents.  One of these, called the Gulf Stream, flows across the North Atlantic.  Water gets heated by the sun in the Caribbean Sea and then moves northwest toward the North Pole.  This makes France, the British Isles, Iceland, and Norway in Europe much warmer in winter than Newfoundland and Nova Scotia in Canada. Without the Gulf Stream, the climates of northeast Canada and northwest Europe might be the same, because these places are about the same distance from the North Pole.
    
    There are currents in the South Atlantic too, but the shape of this sea means that it has less effect on South Africa.
    
    Geology 
    The main feature of the Atlantic Ocean's seabed is a large underwater mountain chain called the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.  It runs from north to south under the Ocean. This is at the boundary of four tectonic plates: Eurasian, North American, South American and African. The ridge extends from Iceland in the north to about 58° south.
    
    The salinity of the surface waters of the open ocean ranges from 3337 parts per thousand and varies with latitude and season.

    Title: Pacific Ocean
    Summary: The Pacific Ocean is the body of water between Asia and Australia in the west, the Americas in the east, the Southern Ocean to the south, and the Arctic Ocean to the north. It is the largest named ocean and it covers one-third of the surface of the entire world. It joins the Atlantic Ocean at a line drawn  south from Cape Horn, Chile/Argentina to Antarctica, and joins the Indian Ocean at a line drawn  south from Tasmania, Australia to Antarctica.
    
    As the Atlantic slowly gets wider, the Pacific is slowly shrinking. It does this by folding the sea floor in towards the centre of the Earth - this is called subduction.  This bumping and grinding is hard so there are many earthquakes and volcanoes when the pressure builds up and is quickly released as large explosions of hot rocks and dust. When an earthquake happens under the sea, the quick jerk causes a tsunami. This is why tsunamis are more common around the edge of the Pacific than anywhere else. Many of the Earth's volcanoes are either islands in the Pacific, or are on continents within a few hundred kilometers of the ocean's edge. Plate tectonics are another reason which makes Pacific Ocean smaller.

    Title: Arctic Ocean
    Summary: The Arctic Ocean is the ocean around the North Pole. The most northern parts of Eurasia and North America are around the Arctic Ocean. Thick pack ice and snow cover almost all of this ocean in winter, and most of it in summer. An icebreaker or a nuclear-powered submarine can use the Northwest Passage through the Arctic Ocean to go between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.
    
    The ocean's area is about 14.056 million km2, which is the smallest of the world's 5 oceans, and it has  of coastline. The central surface covered by ice about  thick. The biology there is quite special. Endangered species there include walruses, whales and polar bears. Year by year the Arctic Ocean is becoming less icy, as a result of global warming.
    
    The average depth of the Arctic Ocean is . The deepest point is in the Eurasian Basin, at .
    
    Geography 
    The Arctic Ocean covers an area of about 14,056,000 km2.  The coastline is 45,390 km (28,200 mi) long It is surrounded by Eurasia, North America, Greenland, and by several islands.
    
    It is generally taken to include Baffin Bay, Barents Sea, Beaufort Sea, Chukchi Sea, East Siberian Sea, Greenland Sea, Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, Kara Sea, Laptev Sea, White Sea and other bodies of water. It is connected to the Pacific Ocean by the Bering Strait  and to the Atlantic Ocean through the Greenland Sea and Labrador Sea.
    
    Countries bordering the Arctic Ocean are: Russia, Norway, Iceland, Greenland, Canada and the United States.
    
    Climate 
    The Arctic Ocean is in a polar climate. Winters are characterized by the polar night, cold and stable weather conditions, and clear skies.
    
    The temperature of the surface of the Arctic Ocean is fairly constant, near the freezing point of seawater.  Arctic Ocean consists of saltwater but its salinity is less than other oceans. The temperature must reach −1.8 °C (28.8 °F) before freezing occurs.
    
    Ice covers most of the Arctic Ocean. It covers almost the whole ocean in late winter and the majority of the ocean in late summer. Much of the Arctic ice pack is covered in snow for about 10 months of the year. The maximum snow cover is in March or April — about 20 to 50 cm (7.9 to 19.7 in).
    
    The climate of the Arctic region has varied significantly in the past. As recently as 55 million years ago, during the eocene epoch, the region reached an average annual temperature of 10–20 °C (50–68 °F). The surface waters of the Arctic Ocean warmed enough to support tropical lifeforms.
    
    Animal and plant life 
    Endangered marine species in the Arctic Ocean include walruses and whales. The area has a fragile ecosystem. The Arctic Ocean has relatively little plant life except for phytoplankton.  Phytoplankton are a crucial part of the ocean. They feed on nutrients from rivers and the currents of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.

    Title: Caribbean Sea
    Summary: The Caribbean Sea is a tropical sea in the center of the Caribbean area. The body of water is part of the Atlantic Ocean. The sea is southeast of the Gulf of Mexico. The Caribbean Sea has many islands, which are popular among North American tourists because of their tropical climate. The Caribbean Sea is famous around the world as a tourist destination.
    
    History 
    Christopher Columbus came across a group of islands in the Caribbean region. When he did so, he thought he had reached another part of the world. Because of this, he named the islands the ‘West Indies’. However, later it was realized that he found an entire region. It still had its natural resources. The name ‘Caribbean’ was later given to it by the Amerindian tribe, the Caribs. That is how it got its name: the Caribbean Sea.
    
    This entire region covers an area of 1,063,000 sq. miles. It covers from Mexico to the boundaries of South America.
    
    This sea is just as deep as it is wide. Its deepest point is believed to be even lower than 25,220 ft, 7,686 m. That makes this point one of the lowest points on the surface of the earth, and the Caribbean Sea one of the deepest seas in the world.

It is known to be one of the most polluted seas in the world including the North Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. The sea is important to regional trade, shipping and fishing.  It is a source of power generation in the form of wind power and nuclear plants. Annual traffic between Great Britain and Ireland amounts to over 12 million passengers and  of traded goods.
    
    Economics 
    It covers  and at its deepest point is  deep. In 2008, about  of fish were caught. Shell fish made up three quarters of this amount.
    
    The Irish Sea has 17 active oil and gas drilling platforms. It is estimated there are about 1.6 billion barrels of oil in the Barryroe oil field alone.
    
    Sealife 
    At least thirty species of shark can be found in the Irish Sea at different times. These include the basking, thresher, blue, mako and porbeagle sharks. There are about 12 species of Dolphin, porpoise and whales in the Irish Sea. These include the common dolphin, bottlenose dolphin and the harbor porpoise.

    Title: North Sea
    Summary: The North Sea is a sea that is part of the Atlantic Ocean in northern Europe. The North Sea is between Norway and Denmark in the east, Scotland and England in the west, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and France in the south.
    
    Borders 
    The Skagerrak connects the North Sea to the Baltic Sea. In the south, the North Sea becomes the English Channel, a sea between England and France. This is called the Dover Straits and is very busy with ships.
    
    The border between the North Sea and the Skagerrak is at an imagined line between Lindesnes in Norway, and Hanstholm in Denmark. In the North, the North sea is open towards the Atlantic. The border between the two is an imagined line from Northern Scotland, to Shetland, and then to Ålesund in Norway. According to the Oslo-Paris Treaty of 1962 it is a bit more to the west and the north though. The treaty puts it at 5° East longitude, and 62° North latitude. That is at the parallel of the Geirangerfjord in Norway.
    
    Various statistical data 
    On average, the North Sea has a depth of only 94 meters. About 80 million people live near the North Sea, at most 150 km away from the coast. Together with the English Channel in the south, the southern North Sea is the busiest body of water in the world.
    
    Rivers that drain into it 
    Well-known rivers that drain into the North Sea include the Tay (at Dundee), the Forth (at Edinburgh), the Tyne (South Shields), the Wear (at Sunderland),  the Tees (near Middlesbrough),  the Elbe (at Cuxhaven), the Weser (at Bremerhaven), the Rhine and Meuse or Maas (at Rotterdam), the Scheldt (at Flushing or Vlissingen), the Thames, and the Humber (at Hull), and the river Nairn (at Nairn)
    
    The Kiel Canal, one of the world's busiest artificial waterways, connects the North Sea with the Baltic.
    
    Name 
    Its name comes from its relationship to the land of the Frisians (see Frisia). They live directly to the south of the North Sea, and to the west of the East Sea (Oostzee, the Baltic Sea), the former South Sea (Zuiderzee, today's IJsselmeer) and the today reclaimed Middle Sea (Middelzee). But the spread of the name could also be from the view of the cities of the Hanseatic League. Some of its main cities, like Lübeck, Bremen or Hamburg had the same view.
    
    In classical times this body of water was also called the Oceanum Germanicum or Mare Germanicum, meaning German Ocean or Sea. This name was commonly used in English and other languages along with the name North Sea, until the early eighteenth century. By the late nineteenth century, German Sea was a rare, scholarly usage even in Germany. In Danish the North Sea is also named Vesterhavet (besides Nordsøen), meaning Western Ocean because it is west of Denmark.
    
    Geographic divisions 
    
    Most of the North sea is on the European Continental shelf. On average, the depth is about 93 to 94 meters only. In the south it is very shallow, only 25 to 35 meters. In the north in the bathyal zone north of Shetland, this depth increases to between 100 and 200 metres. In the south, the depth is at most 50 metres. An exception to this is the Norwegian Trench. It is deepest there, with a depth of 725 metres. The most shallow part of it is a sand bank called Dogger Bank. In the southern part, there are many sand banks.
    
    Looking at the satellite picture it is easy to see the geographic divisions of the North Sea:
    a generally shallow southern North Sea
    the central North Sea
     the northern North Sea, with the Norwegian Trench, near the Skagerrak.
    
    The southern north sea is composed of the Southern Bight, before the coast of Belgium and the Netherlands and the German Bight before the coastline of Germany. The Dogger Bank is the limit between the southern and central parts. The Waddenzee runs all the way from Den Helder in the Netherlands to Esbjerg in Denmark.
    
    The Dogger Bank covers an area about half the size of the Netherlands. There, the North Sea has a depth of between 13 and 20 metres only. The area is very famous for fishing. With some storms there are even waves breaking there.
    
    The Norwegian Trench has an average depth of around 250 to 300 metres; at the entrance to the Skagerrak, the depth increases up to 725 meters. Along the trench is the Norwegian Current, which brings most of the waters of the North Sea into the Atlantic Ocean. Also, most of the waters of the Baltic Sea flow northwards here.
    
    About 200 km east of the Scottish city of Dundee there are more trenches, known collectively as the Devil's hole. Generally, the water is about 90 meters deep there. The trenches very often are only a few kilometers in length. In these trenches, the depth increases to up to 230 meters.
    
    In the Dover Strait the water is about 30 meters deep. At the end of the English Channel, this depth increases to about 100 meters.
    
    History 
    In the last ice age the North Sea was covered by large areas of ice called glaciers. About 20,000 years ago the ice melted and the North Sea was formed (made).
    
    North Sea oil 
    In the 1960s, geologists found large areas of oil and natural gas under the North Sea. Most of the oil fields are owned by the United Kingdom and Norway but some belong to Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany. Drilling began in the 1960s and led to a famous argument between England and Scotland about how the revenue (money) from the oil should be spent.
    
    Animal life 
    
    People have been fishing in the North Sea for thousands of years. However, so many fish are now caught there that new ones may not be able to grow fast enough to keep the fishery going.
    
    Terns, Atlantic puffins, razorbills, kittiwakes and other seabirds live on the North Sea coast. Many coastal areas are protected nature reserves.

    Title: Atlantis
    Summary: Atlantis is a name for a fictional large island or small continent that was (in the legend) in the Atlantic Ocean many years before it sank into the depth of the sea .
    
    The name Atlantis first appears in the writings of Herodotus - he describes the western ocean as "Sea of Atlantis." Then, one generation later, Atlantis is described in detail in the stories Timaeus and Critias by the Greek philosopher Plato.  He used this story to help explain his ideas about government and philosophy. Plato was the only ancient writer who wrote specific things about Atlantis.
    
    According to Plato, the Atlanteans lived 9000 years before his own time and were half human and half god.  They created a very good human society.  When they stopped being good people and did bad things, the gods sent earthquakes and fire to destroy Atlantis.
    
    Many scholars think Plato could have been thinking of a real place when he wrote about Atlantis.  Many, many people have thought of many, many places where the real place that inspired Atlantis could have been.  For example, there was a Minoan kingdom on the island of Santorini.  The Minoan kingdom was very powerful thousands of years before Plato, and their society was damaged when a volcano erupted on their island. According to Plato, Atlantis was very large, as big as North Africa, so it should not have been hard to find.
    
    After the discovery of the Americas, some people in Europe thought they might be Atlantis. However, after Plato, the idea of Atlantis was mostly forgotten until 1882, when a writer named Ignatius Donnelly wrote a book saying that Atlantis was real and that the culture of Atlantis had started many other ancient cultures, such as the Egyptian and Mayan.  Then other people became interested in Atlantis. 
    
    Atlantis has appeared in many works of fiction.  In Marvel Comics, Atlantis is at the bottom of the ocean and exists in modern times, with people who breathe water.  Other works of fiction use Atlantis as background.  For example, Robert E. Howard set his Conan the Barbarian stories in a fictional time called the Hyborian Age, which began with the destruction of Atlantis and ended when real written history started.

## Next steps

Success! Now you know how to use Elasticsearch as a vector database to store embeddings, encode queries by calling the OpenAI `embeddings` endpoint, and run semantic search.

Play around with different queries, and if you want to try with your own data, you can experiment with different embedding models.

ℹ️ Check out our other notebook [Retrieval augmented generation using Elasticsearch and OpenAI](openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/vector_databases/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-semantic-search.ipynb). That notebook builds on this example to demonstrate how to use Elasticsearch together with the OpenAI [chat completions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat) API for retrieval augmented generation (RAG).

To create a `ElasticsearchEmbeddingsCache` byte store, you'll need an Elasticsearch cluster. You can [set one up locally](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch) or create an [Elastic account](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch).

### Installation

The LangChain `ElasticsearchEmbeddingsCache` integration lives in the `__package_name__` package:


```python
%pip install -qU langchain_elasticsearch
```

## Instantiation

Now we can instantiate our byte store:


```python
from langchain_elasticsearch import ElasticsearchEmbeddingsCache

# Example config for a locally running Elasticsearch instance
kv_store = ElasticsearchEmbeddingsCache(
    es_url="https://localhost:9200",
    index_name="llm-chat-cache",
    metadata={"project": "my_chatgpt_project"},
    namespace="my_chatgpt_project",
    es_user="elastic",
    es_password="<GENERATED PASSWORD>",
    es_params={
        "ca_certs": "~/http_ca.crt",
    },
)
```

## Usage

You can set data under keys like this using the `mset` method:


```python
kv_store.mset(
    [
        ["key1", b"value1"],
        ["key2", b"value2"],
    ]
)

kv_store.mget(
    [
        "key1",
        "key2",
    ]
)
```




    [b'value1', b'value2']



And you can delete data using the `mdelete` method:


```python
kv_store.mdelete(
    [
        "key1",
        "key2",
    ]
)

kv_store.mget(
    [
        "key1",
        "key2",
    ]
)
```




    [None, None]



## Use as an embeddings cache

Like other `ByteStores`, you can use an `ElasticsearchEmbeddingsCache` instance for [persistent caching in document ingestion](/docs/how_to/caching_embeddings/) for RAG.

However, cached vectors won't be searchable by default. The developer can customize the building of the Elasticsearch document in order to add indexed vector field.

This can be done by subclassing and overriding methods:


```python
from typing import Any, Dict, List


class SearchableElasticsearchStore(ElasticsearchEmbeddingsCache):
    @property
    def mapping(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        mapping = super().mapping
        mapping["mappings"]["properties"]["vector"] = {
            "type": "dense_vector",
            "dims": 1536,
            "index": True,
            "similarity": "dot_product",
        }
        return mapping

    def build_document(self, llm_input: str, vector: List[float]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        body = super().build_document(llm_input, vector)
        body["vector"] = vector
        return body
```

When overriding the mapping and the document building, please only make additive modifications, keeping the base mapping intact.

# Elasticsearch

>[Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/) is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine, capable of performing both vector and lexical search. It is built on top of the Apache Lucene library.

This notebook shows how to use chat message history functionality with `Elasticsearch`.

## Set up Elasticsearch

There are two main ways to set up an Elasticsearch instance:

1. **Elastic Cloud.** Elastic Cloud is a managed Elasticsearch service. Sign up for a [free trial](https://cloud.elastic.co/registration?storm=langchain-notebook).

2. **Local Elasticsearch installation.** Get started with Elasticsearch by running it locally. The easiest way is to use the official Elasticsearch Docker image. See the [Elasticsearch Docker documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docker.html) for more information.

## Install dependencies


```python
%pip install --upgrade --quiet  elasticsearch langchain langchain-community
```

## Authentication

### How to obtain a password for the default "elastic" user

To obtain your Elastic Cloud password for the default "elastic" user:
1. Log in to the [Elastic Cloud console](https://cloud.elastic.co)
2. Go to "Security" > "Users"
3. Locate the "elastic" user and click "Edit"
4. Click "Reset password"
5. Follow the prompts to reset the password


### Use the Username/password

```python
es_username = os.environ.get("ES_USERNAME", "elastic")
es_password = os.environ.get("ES_PASSWORD", "change me...")

history = ElasticsearchChatMessageHistory(
    es_url=es_url,
    es_user=es_username,
    es_password=es_password,
    index="test-history",
    session_id="test-session"
)
```

### How to obtain an API key

To obtain an API key:
1. Log in to the [Elastic Cloud console](https://cloud.elastic.co)
2. Open `Kibana` and go to Stack Management > API Keys
3. Click "Create API key"
4. Enter a name for the API key and click "Create"

### Use the API key

```python
es_api_key = os.environ.get("ES_API_KEY")

history = ElasticsearchChatMessageHistory(
    es_api_key=es_api_key,
    index="test-history",
    session_id="test-session"
)
```


## Initialize Elasticsearch client and chat message history


```python
import os

from langchain_community.chat_message_histories import (
    ElasticsearchChatMessageHistory,
)

es_url = os.environ.get("ES_URL", "http://localhost:9200")

# If using Elastic Cloud:
# es_cloud_id = os.environ.get("ES_CLOUD_ID")

# Note: see Authentication section for various authentication methods

history = ElasticsearchChatMessageHistory(
    es_url=es_url, index="test-history", session_id="test-session"
)
```

## Use the chat message history


```python
history.add_user_message("hi!")
history.add_ai_message("whats up?")
```

    indexing message content='hi!' additional_kwargs={} example=False
    indexing message content='whats up?' additional_kwargs={} example=False

We can use LLMs to interact with Elasticsearch analytics databases in natural language.

This chain builds search queries via the Elasticsearch DSL API (filters and aggregations).

The Elasticsearch client must have permissions for index listing, mapping description and search queries.

See [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docker.html) for instructions on how to run Elasticsearch locally.


```python
! pip install langchain langchain-experimental openai elasticsearch

# Set env var OPENAI_API_KEY or load from a .env file
# import dotenv

# dotenv.load_dotenv()
```


```python
from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch
from langchain.chains.elasticsearch_database import ElasticsearchDatabaseChain
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
```


```python
# Initialize Elasticsearch python client.
# See https://elasticsearch-py.readthedocs.io/en/v8.8.2/api.html#elasticsearch.Elasticsearch
ELASTIC_SEARCH_SERVER = "https://elastic:pass@localhost:9200"
db = Elasticsearch(ELASTIC_SEARCH_SERVER)
```

Uncomment the next cell to initially populate your db.


```python
# customers = [
#     {"firstname": "Jennifer", "lastname": "Walters"},
#     {"firstname": "Monica","lastname":"Rambeau"},
#     {"firstname": "Carol","lastname":"Danvers"},
#     {"firstname": "Wanda","lastname":"Maximoff"},
#     {"firstname": "Jennifer","lastname":"Takeda"},
# ]
# for i, customer in enumerate(customers):
#     db.create(index="customers", document=customer, id=i)
```


```python
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4", temperature=0)
chain = ElasticsearchDatabaseChain.from_llm(llm=llm, database=db, verbose=True)
```


```python
question = "What are the first names of all the customers?"
chain.run(question)
```

We can customize the prompt.


```python
from langchain.prompts.prompt import PromptTemplate

PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """Given an input question, create a syntactically correct Elasticsearch query to run. Unless the user specifies in their question a specific number of examples they wish to obtain, always limit your query to at most {top_k} results. You can order the results by a relevant column to return the most interesting examples in the database.

Unless told to do not query for all the columns from a specific index, only ask for a the few relevant columns given the question.

Pay attention to use only the column names that you can see in the mapping description. Be careful to not query for columns that do not exist. Also, pay attention to which column is in which index. Return the query as valid json.

Use the following format:

Question: Question here
ESQuery: Elasticsearch Query formatted as json
"""

PROMPT = PromptTemplate.from_template(
    PROMPT_TEMPLATE,
)
chain = ElasticsearchDatabaseChain.from_llm(llm=llm, database=db, query_prompt=PROMPT)
```

# ElasticsearchRetriever

>[Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/) is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine. It provides a distributed, multitenant-capable full-text search engine with an HTTP web interface and schema-free JSON documents. It supports keyword search, vector search, hybrid search and complex filtering.

The `ElasticsearchRetriever` is a generic wrapper to enable flexible access to all `Elasticsearch` features through the [Query DSL](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl.html).  For most use cases the other classes (`ElasticsearchStore`, `ElasticsearchEmbeddings`, etc.) should suffice, but if they don't you can use `ElasticsearchRetriever`.

This guide will help you getting started with the Elasticsearch [retriever](/docs/concepts/retrievers). For detailed documentation of all `ElasticsearchRetriever` features and configurations head to the [API reference](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/elasticsearch/retrievers/langchain_elasticsearch.retrievers.ElasticsearchRetriever.html).

### Integration details

import {ItemTable} from "@theme/FeatureTables";

<ItemTable category="document_retrievers" item="ElasticsearchRetriever" />


## Setup

There are two main ways to set up an Elasticsearch instance:

- Elastic Cloud: [Elastic Cloud](https://cloud.elastic.co/) is a managed Elasticsearch service. Sign up for a [free trial](https://www.elastic.co/cloud/cloud-trial-overview).
To connect to an Elasticsearch instance that does not require login credentials (starting the docker instance with security enabled), pass the Elasticsearch URL and index name along with the embedding object to the constructor.

- Local Install Elasticsearch: Get started with Elasticsearch by running it locally. The easiest way is to use the official Elasticsearch Docker image. See the [Elasticsearch Docker documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docker.html) for more information.

If you want to get automated tracing from individual queries, you can also set your [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) API key by uncommenting below:


```python
# os.environ["LANGSMITH_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("Enter your LangSmith API key: ")
# os.environ["LANGSMITH_TRACING"] = "true"
```

### Installation

This retriever lives in the `langchain-elasticsearch` package. For demonstration purposes, we will also install `langchain-community` to generate text [embeddings](/docs/concepts/embedding_models).


```python
%pip install -qU langchain-community langchain-elasticsearch
```


```python
from typing import Any, Dict, Iterable

from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch
from elasticsearch.helpers import bulk
from langchain_community.embeddings import DeterministicFakeEmbedding
from langchain_core.documents import Document
from langchain_core.embeddings import Embeddings
from langchain_elasticsearch import ElasticsearchRetriever
```

### Configure

Here we define the conncection to Elasticsearch. In this example we use a locally running instance. Alternatively, you can make an account in [Elastic Cloud](https://cloud.elastic.co/) and start a [free trial](https://www.elastic.co/cloud/cloud-trial-overview).


```python
es_url = "http://localhost:9200"
es_client = Elasticsearch(hosts=[es_url])
es_client.info()
```

For vector search, we are going to use random embeddings just for illustration. For real use cases, pick one of the available LangChain [Embeddings](/docs/integrations/text_embedding) classes.


```python
embeddings = DeterministicFakeEmbedding(size=3)
```

#### Define example data


```python
index_name = "test-langchain-retriever"
text_field = "text"
dense_vector_field = "fake_embedding"
num_characters_field = "num_characters"
texts = [
    "foo",
    "bar",
    "world",
    "hello world",
    "hello",
    "foo bar",
    "bla bla foo",
]
```

#### Index data

Typically, users make use of `ElasticsearchRetriever` when they already have data in an Elasticsearch index. Here we index some example text documents. If you created an index for example using `ElasticsearchStore.from_documents` that's also fine.


```python
def create_index(
    es_client: Elasticsearch,
    index_name: str,
    text_field: str,
    dense_vector_field: str,
    num_characters_field: str,
):
    es_client.indices.create(
        index=index_name,
        mappings={
            "properties": {
                text_field: {"type": "text"},
                dense_vector_field: {"type": "dense_vector"},
                num_characters_field: {"type": "integer"},
            }
        },
    )


def index_data(
    es_client: Elasticsearch,
    index_name: str,
    text_field: str,
    dense_vector_field: str,
    embeddings: Embeddings,
    texts: Iterable[str],
    refresh: bool = True,
) -> None:
    create_index(
        es_client, index_name, text_field, dense_vector_field, num_characters_field
    )

    vectors = embeddings.embed_documents(list(texts))
    requests = [
        {
            "_op_type": "index",
            "_index": index_name,
            "_id": i,
            text_field: text,
            dense_vector_field: vector,
            num_characters_field: len(text),
        }
        for i, (text, vector) in enumerate(zip(texts, vectors))
    ]

    bulk(es_client, requests)

    if refresh:
        es_client.indices.refresh(index=index_name)

    return len(requests)
```


```python
index_data(es_client, index_name, text_field, dense_vector_field, embeddings, texts)
```

## Instantiation

### Vector search

Dense vector retrival using fake embeddings in this example.


```python
def vector_query(search_query: str) -> Dict:
    vector = embeddings.embed_query(search_query)  # same embeddings as for indexing
    return {
        "knn": {
            "field": dense_vector_field,
            "query_vector": vector,
            "k": 5,
            "num_candidates": 10,
        }
    }


vector_retriever = ElasticsearchRetriever.from_es_params(
    index_name=index_name,
    body_func=vector_query,
    content_field=text_field,
    url=es_url,
)

vector_retriever.invoke("foo")
```




    [Document(page_content='foo', metadata={'_index': 'test-langchain-index', '_id': '0', '_score': 1.0, '_source': {'fake_embedding': [-2.336764233933763, 0.27510289545940503, -0.7957597268194339], 'num_characters': 3}}),

### BM25

Traditional keyword matching.


```python
def bm25_query(search_query: str) -> Dict:
    return {
        "query": {
            "match": {
                text_field: search_query,
            },
        },
    }


bm25_retriever = ElasticsearchRetriever.from_es_params(
    index_name=index_name,
    body_func=bm25_query,
    content_field=text_field,
    url=es_url,
)

bm25_retriever.invoke("foo")
```




    [Document(page_content='foo', metadata={'_index': 'test-langchain-index', '_id': '0', '_score': 0.9711467, '_source': {'fake_embedding': [-2.336764233933763, 0.27510289545940503, -0.7957597268194339], 'num_characters': 3}}),
     Document(page_content='foo bar', metadata={'_index': 'test-langchain-index', '_id': '5', '_score': 0.7437035, '_source': {'fake_embedding': [0.2533670476638539, 0.08100381646160418, 0.7763644080870179], 'num_characters': 7}}),
     Document(page_content='bla bla foo', metadata={'_index': 'test-langchain-index', '_id': '6', '_score': 0.6025789, '_source': {'fake_embedding': [1.7365927060137358, -0.5230400847844948, 0.7978339724186192], 'num_characters': 11}})]



### Hybrid search

The combination of vector search and BM25 search using [Reciprocal Rank Fusion](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/rrf.html) (RRF) to combine the result sets.


```python
def hybrid_query(search_query: str) -> Dict:
    vector = embeddings.embed_query(search_query)  # same embeddings as for indexing
    return {
        "retriever": {
            "rrf": {
                "retrievers": [
                    {
                        "standard": {
                            "query": {
                                "match": {
                                    text_field: search_query,
                                }
                            }
                        }
                    },
                    {
                        "knn": {
                            "field": dense_vector_field,
                            "query_vector": vector,
                            "k": 5,
                            "num_candidates": 10,
                        }
                    },
                ]
            }
        }
    }


hybrid_retriever = ElasticsearchRetriever.from_es_params(
    index_name=index_name,
    body_func=hybrid_query,
    content_field=text_field,
    url=es_url,
)

hybrid_retriever.invoke("foo")
```




    [Document(page_content='foo', metadata={'_index': 'test-langchain-index', '_id': '0', '_score': 0.9711467, '_source': {'fake_embedding': [-2.336764233933763, 0.27510289545940503, -0.7957597268194339], 'num_characters': 3}}),
     Document(page_content='foo bar', metadata={'_index': 'test-langchain-index', '_id': '5', '_score': 0.7437035, '_source': {'fake_embedding': [0.2533670476638539, 0.08100381646160418, 0.7763644080870179], 'num_characters': 7}}),
     Document(page_content='bla bla foo', metadata={'_index': 'test-langchain-index', '_id': '6', '_score': 0.6025789, '_source': {'fake_embedding': [1.7365927060137358, -0.5230400847844948, 0.7978339724186192], 'num_characters': 11}})]



### Fuzzy matching

Keyword matching with typo tolerance.


```python
def fuzzy_query(search_query: str) -> Dict:
    return {
        "query": {
            "match": {
                text_field: {
                    "query": search_query,
                    "fuzziness": "AUTO",
                }
            },
        },
    }


fuzzy_retriever = ElasticsearchRetriever.from_es_params(
    index_name=index_name,
    body_func=fuzzy_query,
    content_field=text_field,
    url=es_url,
)

fuzzy_retriever.invoke("fox")  # note the character tolernace
```




    [Document(page_content='foo', metadata={'_index': 'test-langchain-index', '_id': '0', '_score': 0.6474311, '_source': {'fake_embedding': [-2.336764233933763, 0.27510289545940503, -0.7957597268194339], 'num_characters': 3}}),

### Complex filtering

Combination of filters on different fields.


```python
def filter_query_func(search_query: str) -> Dict:
    return {
        "query": {
            "bool": {
                "must": [
                    {"range": {num_characters_field: {"gte": 5}}},
                ],
                "must_not": [
                    {"prefix": {text_field: "bla"}},
                ],
                "should": [
                    {"match": {text_field: search_query}},
                ],
            }
        }
    }


filtering_retriever = ElasticsearchRetriever.from_es_params(
    index_name=index_name,
    body_func=filter_query_func,
    content_field=text_field,
    url=es_url,
)

filtering_retriever.invoke("foo")
```




    [Document(page_content='foo bar', metadata={'_index': 'test-langchain-index', '_id': '5', '_score': 1.7437035, '_source': {'fake_embedding': [0.2533670476638539, 0.08100381646160418, 0.7763644080870179], 'num_characters': 7}}),
     Document(page_content='world', metadata={'_index': 'test-langchain-index', '_id': '2', '_score': 1.0, '_source': {'fake_embedding': [-0.7041151202179595, -1.4652961969276497, -0.25786766898672847], 'num_characters': 5}}),
     Document(page_content='hello world', metadata={'_index': 'test-langchain-index', '_id': '3', '_score': 1.0, '_source': {'fake_embedding': [0.42728413221815387, -1.1889908285425348, -1.445433230084671], 'num_characters': 11}}),
     Document(page_content='hello', metadata={'_index': 'test-langchain-index', '_id': '4', '_score': 1.0, '_source': {'fake_embedding': [-0.28560441330564046, 0.9958894823084921, 1.5489829880195058], 'num_characters': 5}})]



Note that the query match is on top. The other documents that got passed the filter are also in the result set, but they all have the same score.

### Custom document mapper

It is possible to cusomize the function that maps an Elasticsearch result (hit) to a LangChain document.


```python
def num_characters_mapper(hit: Dict[str, Any]) -> Document:
    num_chars = hit["_source"][num_characters_field]
    content = hit["_source"][text_field]
    return Document(
        page_content=f"This document has {num_chars} characters",
        metadata={"text_content": content},
    )


custom_mapped_retriever = ElasticsearchRetriever.from_es_params(
    index_name=index_name,
    body_func=filter_query_func,
    document_mapper=num_characters_mapper,
    url=es_url,
)

custom_mapped_retriever.invoke("foo")
```




    [Document(page_content='This document has 7 characters', metadata={'text_content': 'foo bar'}),
     Document(page_content='This document has 5 characters', metadata={'text_content': 'world'}),
     Document(page_content='This document has 11 characters', metadata={'text_content': 'hello world'}),
     Document(page_content='This document has 5 characters', metadata={'text_content': 'hello'})]



## Usage

Following the above examples, we use `.invoke` to issue a single query. Because retrievers are Runnables, we can use any method in the [Runnable interface](/docs/concepts/runnables), such as `.batch`, as well.

## Use within a chain

We can also incorporate retrievers into [chains](/docs/how_to/sequence/) to build larger applications, such as a simple [RAG](/docs/tutorials/rag/) application. For demonstration purposes, we instantiate an OpenAI chat model as well.


```python
%pip install -qU langchain-openai
```


```python
from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnablePassthrough
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(
    """Answer the question based only on the context provided.

Context: {context}

Question: {question}"""
)

llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini")


def format_docs(docs):
    return "\n\n".join(doc.page_content for doc in docs)


chain = (
    {"context": vector_retriever | format_docs, "question": RunnablePassthrough()}
    | prompt
    | llm
    | StrOutputParser()
)
```


```python
chain.invoke("what is foo?")
```

# Elasticsearch

> [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/) is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine.
> It provides a distributed, multi-tenant-capable full-text search engine with an HTTP web interface and schema-free
> JSON documents.

In this notebook, we'll demo the `SelfQueryRetriever` with an `Elasticsearch` vector store.

## Creating an Elasticsearch vector store

First, we'll want to create an `Elasticsearch` vector store and seed it with some data. We've created a small demo set of documents that contain summaries of movies.

**Note:** The self-query retriever requires you to have `lark` installed (`pip install lark`). We also need the `elasticsearch` package.


```python
%pip install --upgrade --quiet  U lark langchain langchain-elasticsearch
```

    [33mWARNING: You are using pip version 22.0.4; however, version 23.3 is available.
    You should consider upgrading via the '/Users/joe/projects/elastic/langchain/libs/langchain/.venv/bin/python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip' command.[0m[33m
    [0m


```python
import getpass
import os

from langchain_core.documents import Document
from langchain_elasticsearch import ElasticsearchStore
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings

if "OPENAI_API_KEY" not in os.environ:
    os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("OpenAI API Key:")

embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
```


```python
docs = [
    Document(
        page_content="A bunch of scientists bring back dinosaurs and mayhem breaks loose",
        metadata={"year": 1993, "rating": 7.7, "genre": "science fiction"},
    ),
    Document(
        page_content="Leo DiCaprio gets lost in a dream within a dream within a dream within a ...",
        metadata={"year": 2010, "director": "Christopher Nolan", "rating": 8.2},
    ),
    Document(
        page_content="A psychologist / detective gets lost in a series of dreams within dreams within dreams and Inception reused the idea",
        metadata={"year": 2006, "director": "Satoshi Kon", "rating": 8.6},
    ),
    Document(
        page_content="A bunch of normal-sized women are supremely wholesome and some men pine after them",
        metadata={"year": 2019, "director": "Greta Gerwig", "rating": 8.3},
    ),
    Document(
        page_content="Toys come alive and have a blast doing so",
        metadata={"year": 1995, "genre": "animated"},
    ),
    Document(
        page_content="Three men walk into the Zone, three men walk out of the Zone",
        metadata={
            "year": 1979,
            "director": "Andrei Tarkovsky",
            "genre": "science fiction",
            "rating": 9.9,
        },
    ),
]
vectorstore = ElasticsearchStore.from_documents(
    docs,
    embeddings,
    index_name="elasticsearch-self-query-demo",
    es_url="http://localhost:9200",
)
```

## Creating our self-querying retriever
Now we can instantiate our retriever. To do this we'll need to provide some information upfront about the metadata fields that our documents support and a short description of the document contents.


```python
from langchain.chains.query_constructor.base import AttributeInfo
from langchain.retrievers.self_query.base import SelfQueryRetriever
from langchain_openai import OpenAI

metadata_field_info = [
    AttributeInfo(
        name="genre",
        description="The genre of the movie",
        type="string or list[string]",
    ),
    AttributeInfo(
        name="year",
        description="The year the movie was released",
        type="integer",
    ),
    AttributeInfo(
        name="director",
        description="The name of the movie director",
        type="string",
    ),
    AttributeInfo(
        name="rating", description="A 1-10 rating for the movie", type="float"
    ),
]
document_content_description = "Brief summary of a movie"
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
retriever = SelfQueryRetriever.from_llm(
    llm, vectorstore, document_content_description, metadata_field_info, verbose=True
)
```

## Testing it out
And now we can try actually using our retriever!


```python
# This example only specifies a relevant query
retriever.invoke("What are some movies about dinosaurs")
```




    [Document(page_content='A bunch of scientists bring back dinosaurs and mayhem breaks loose', metadata={'year': 1993, 'rating': 7.7, 'genre': 'science fiction'}),
     Document(page_content='Toys come alive and have a blast doing so', metadata={'year': 1995, 'genre': 'animated'}),
     Document(page_content='Three men walk into the Zone, three men walk out of the Zone', metadata={'year': 1979, 'rating': 9.9, 'director': 'Andrei Tarkovsky', 'genre': 'science fiction'}),
     Document(page_content='A psychologist / detective gets lost in a series of dreams within dreams within dreams and Inception reused the idea', metadata={'year': 2006, 'director': 'Satoshi Kon', 'rating': 8.6})]




```python
# This example specifies a query and a filter
retriever.invoke("Has Greta Gerwig directed any movies about women")
```




    [Document(page_content='A bunch of normal-sized women are supremely wholesome and some men pine after them', metadata={'year': 2019, 'director': 'Greta Gerwig', 'rating': 8.3})]



## Filter k

We can also use the self query retriever to specify `k`: the number of documents to fetch.

We can do this by passing `enable_limit=True` to the constructor.


```python
retriever = SelfQueryRetriever.from_llm(
    llm,
    vectorstore,
    document_content_description,
    metadata_field_info,
    enable_limit=True,
    verbose=True,
)
```


```python
# This example only specifies a relevant query
retriever.invoke("what are two movies about dinosaurs")
```




    [Document(page_content='A bunch of scientists bring back dinosaurs and mayhem breaks loose', metadata={'year': 1993, 'rating': 7.7, 'genre': 'science fiction'}),
     Document(page_content='Toys come alive and have a blast doing so', metadata={'year': 1995, 'genre': 'animated'})]



## Complex queries in Action!
We've tried out some simple queries, but what about more complex ones? Let's try out a few more complex queries that utilize the full power of Elasticsearch.


```python
retriever.invoke(
    "what animated or comedy movies have been released in the last 30 years about animated toys?"
)
```




    [Document(page_content='Toys come alive and have a blast doing so', metadata={'year': 1995, 'genre': 'animated'})]




```python
vectorstore.client.indices.delete(index="elasticsearch-self-query-demo")
```




################################################## elastic_search_bm25.md ##################################################


# ElasticSearch BM25

>[Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/) is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine. It provides a distributed, multitenant-capable full-text search engine with an HTTP web interface and schema-free JSON documents.

>In information retrieval, [Okapi BM25](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25) (BM is an abbreviation of best matching) is a ranking function used by search engines to estimate the relevance of documents to a given search query. It is based on the probabilistic retrieval framework developed in the 1970s and 1980s by Stephen E. Robertson, Karen Spärck Jones, and others.

>The name of the actual ranking function is BM25. The fuller name, Okapi BM25, includes the name of the first system to use it, which was the Okapi information retrieval system, implemented at London's City University in the 1980s and 1990s. BM25 and its newer variants, e.g. BM25F (a version of BM25 that can take document structure and anchor text into account), represent TF-IDF-like retrieval functions used in document retrieval.

This notebook shows how to use a retriever that uses `ElasticSearch` and `BM25`.

For more information on the details of BM25 see [this blog post](https://www.elastic.co/blog/practical-bm25-part-2-the-bm25-algorithm-and-its-variables).


```python
%pip install --upgrade --quiet  elasticsearch
```


```python
from langchain_community.retrievers import (
    ElasticSearchBM25Retriever,
)
```

## Create New Retriever


```python
elasticsearch_url = "http://localhost:9200"
retriever = ElasticSearchBM25Retriever.create(elasticsearch_url, "langchain-index-4")
```


```python
# Alternatively, you can load an existing index
# import elasticsearch
# elasticsearch_url="http://localhost:9200"
# retriever = ElasticSearchBM25Retriever(elasticsearch.Elasticsearch(elasticsearch_url), "langchain-index")
```

## Add texts (if necessary)

We can optionally add texts to the retriever (if they aren't already in there)


```python
retriever.add_texts(["foo", "bar", "world", "hello", "foo bar"])
```




    ['cbd4cb47-8d9f-4f34-b80e-ea871bc49856',
     'f3bd2e24-76d1-4f9b-826b-ec4c0e8c7365',
     '8631bfc8-7c12-48ee-ab56-8ad5f373676e',
     '8be8374c-3253-4d87-928d-d73550a2ecf0',
     'd79f457b-2842-4eab-ae10-77aa420b53d7']



## Use Retriever

We can now use the retriever!


```python
result = retriever.invoke("foo")
```


```python
result
```




    [Document(page_content='foo', metadata={}),
     Document(page_content='foo bar', metadata={})]




```python

# Eleven Labs Text2Speech

This notebook shows how to interact with the `ElevenLabs API` to achieve text-to-speech capabilities.

First, you need to set up an ElevenLabs account. You can follow the instructions [here](https://docs.elevenlabs.io/welcome/introduction).


```python
%pip install --upgrade --quiet  elevenlabs langchain-community
```


```python
import os

os.environ["ELEVEN_API_KEY"] = ""
```

## Usage


```python
from langchain_community.tools import ElevenLabsText2SpeechTool

text_to_speak = "Hello world! I am the real slim shady"

tts = ElevenLabsText2SpeechTool()
tts.name
```




    'eleven_labs_text2speech'



We can generate audio, save it to the temporary file and then play it.


```python
speech_file = tts.run(text_to_speak)
tts.play(speech_file)
```

Or stream audio directly.


```python
tts.stream_speech(text_to_speak)
```

## Use within an Agent


```python
from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent, load_tools
from langchain_openai import OpenAI
```


```python
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
tools = load_tools(["eleven_labs_text2speech"])
agent = initialize_agent(
    tools=tools,
    llm=llm,
    agent=AgentType.STRUCTURED_CHAT_ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION,
    verbose=True,
)
```


```python
audio_file = agent.run("Tell me a joke and read it out for me.")

# Email

This notebook shows how to load email (`.eml`) or `Microsoft Outlook` (`.msg`) files.

Please see [this guide](/docs/integrations/providers/unstructured/) for more instructions on setting up Unstructured locally, including setting up required system dependencies.

## Using Unstructured


```python
%pip install --upgrade --quiet unstructured
```


```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import UnstructuredEmailLoader

loader = UnstructuredEmailLoader("./example_data/fake-email.eml")

data = loader.load()

data
```




    [Document(page_content='This is a test email to use for unit tests.\n\nImportant points:\n\nRoses are red\n\nViolets are blue', metadata={'source': './example_data/fake-email.eml'})]



### Retain Elements

Under the hood, Unstructured creates different "elements" for different chunks of text. By default we combine those together, but you can easily keep that separation by specifying `mode="elements"`.


```python
loader = UnstructuredEmailLoader("example_data/fake-email.eml", mode="elements")

data = loader.load()

data[0]
```




    Document(page_content='This is a test email to use for unit tests.', metadata={'source': 'example_data/fake-email.eml', 'file_directory': 'example_data', 'filename': 'fake-email.eml', 'last_modified': '2022-12-16T17:04:16-05:00', 'sent_from': ['Matthew Robinson <mrobinson@unstructured.io>'], 'sent_to': ['Matthew Robinson <mrobinson@unstructured.io>'], 'subject': 'Test Email', 'languages': ['eng'], 'filetype': 'message/rfc822', 'category': 'NarrativeText'})



### Processing Attachments

You can process attachments with `UnstructuredEmailLoader` by setting `process_attachments=True` in the constructor. By default, attachments will be partitioned using the `partition` function from `unstructured`. You can use a different partitioning function by passing the function to the `attachment_partitioner` kwarg.


```python
loader = UnstructuredEmailLoader(
    "example_data/fake-email.eml",
    mode="elements",
    process_attachments=True,
)

data = loader.load()

data[0]
```




    Document(page_content='This is a test email to use for unit tests.', metadata={'source': 'example_data/fake-email.eml', 'file_directory': 'example_data', 'filename': 'fake-email.eml', 'last_modified': '2022-12-16T17:04:16-05:00', 'sent_from': ['Matthew Robinson <mrobinson@unstructured.io>'], 'sent_to': ['Matthew Robinson <mrobinson@unstructured.io>'], 'subject': 'Test Email', 'languages': ['eng'], 'filetype': 'message/rfc822', 'category': 'NarrativeText'})



## Using OutlookMessageLoader


```python
%pip install --upgrade --quiet extract_msg
```


```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import OutlookMessageLoader

loader = OutlookMessageLoader("example_data/fake-email.msg")

data = loader.load()

data[0]
```




    Document(page_content='This is a test email to experiment with the MS Outlook MSG Extractor\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\n\r\n\r\nKind regards\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBrian Zhou\r\n\r\n', metadata={'source': 'example_data/fake-email.msg', 'subject': 'Test for TIF files', 'sender': 'Brian Zhou <brizhou@gmail.com>', 'date': datetime.datetime(2013, 11, 18, 0, 26, 24, tzinfo=zoneinfo.ZoneInfo(key='America/Los_Angeles'))})

```python
embeddings = EmbaasEmbeddings()
```


```python
# Create embeddings for a single document
doc_text = "This is a test document."
doc_text_embedding = embeddings.embed_query(doc_text)
```


```python
# Print created embedding
print(doc_text_embedding)
```


```python
# Create embeddings for multiple documents
doc_texts = ["This is a test document.", "This is another test document."]
doc_texts_embeddings = embeddings.embed_documents(doc_texts)
```


```python
# Print created embeddings
for i, doc_text_embedding in enumerate(doc_texts_embeddings):
    print(f"Embedding for document {i + 1}: {doc_text_embedding}")
```


```python
# Using a different model and/or custom instruction

# Embedchain

>[Embedchain](https://github.com/embedchain/embedchain) is a RAG framework to create data pipelines. It loads, indexes, retrieves and syncs all the data.
>
>It is available as an [open source package](https://github.com/embedchain/embedchain) and as a [hosted platform solution](https://app.embedchain.ai/).

This notebook shows how to use a retriever that uses `Embedchain`.

# Installation

First you will need to install the [`embedchain` package](https://pypi.org/project/embedchain/). 

You can install the package by running 


```python
%pip install --upgrade --quiet  embedchain
```

# Create New Retriever

`EmbedchainRetriever` has a static `.create()` factory method that takes the following arguments:

* `yaml_path: string` optional -- Path to the YAML configuration file. If not provided, a default configuration is used. You can browse the [docs](https://docs.embedchain.ai/) to explore various customization options.


```python
# Setup API Key

import os
from getpass import getpass

if "OPENAI_API_KEY" not in os.environ:
    os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = getpass()
```

     ········
    


```python
from langchain_community.retrievers import EmbedchainRetriever

# create a retriever with default options
retriever = EmbedchainRetriever.create()

# or if you want to customize, pass the yaml config path
# retriever = EmbedchainRetiever.create(yaml_path="config.yaml")
```

# Add Data

In embedchain, you can as many supported data types as possible. You can browse our [docs](https://docs.embedchain.ai/) to see the data types supported.

Embedchain automatically deduces the types of the data. So you can add a string, URL or local file path.


```python
retriever.add_texts(
    [
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk",
        "https://www.forbes.com/profile/elon-musk",
        "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcYjXbSJBN8",
    ]
)
```

# Use Retriever

You can now use the retrieve to find relevant documents given a query


```python
result = retriever.invoke("How many companies does Elon Musk run and name those?")
```


```python
result
```

This notebook demonstrates how vector similarity is relevant to LLM-generated embeddings. You will embed a collection of labelled documents and then plot the embeddings on a two-dimensional t-SNE plot to observe how similar documents tend to cluster together based on their embeddings.

## Getting started

### Install libraries


```
%pip install --user langchain==0.0.315 \
                    google-cloud-aiplatform==1.35.0 \
                    scikit-learn==1.3.1
```

### Restart current runtime

To use the newly installed packages in this Jupyter runtime, you must restart the runtime. You can do this by running the cell below, which will restart the current kernel.


```
# Restart kernel after installs so that your environment can access the new packages
import IPython

app = IPython.Application.instance()
app.kernel.do_shutdown(True)
```

<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning">
<b>⚠️ The kernel is going to restart. Please wait until it is finished before continuing to the next step. ⚠️</b>
</div>


### Authenticate your notebook environment (Colab only)

If you are running this notebook on Google Colab, you will need to authenticate your environment. To do this, run the new cell below. This step is not required if you are using [Vertex AI Workbench](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai-workbench).


```
import sys

if "google.colab" in sys.modules:
    # Define project information
    PROJECT_ID = "[your-project-id]"  # @param {type:"string"}
    LOCATION = "us-central1"  # @param {type:"string"}

    # Authenticate user to Google Cloud
    from google.colab import auth

    auth.authenticate_user()
```

### Import libraries


```
import re

from google.api_core import retry
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups
from sklearn.manifold import TSNE
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from tqdm.auto import tqdm
from vertexai.language_models import TextEmbeddingModel

tqdm.pandas()
```

## Fetch and clean the data

In this example, you will use the open source [20 Newsgroups](http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/) dataset, a collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, partitioned (nearly) evenly across 20 different newsgroups


```
categories = ["comp.graphics", "sci.space", "sci.med", "rec.sport.hockey"]
newsgroups = fetch_20newsgroups(categories=categories)
```


```
raw_data = pd.DataFrame()
raw_data["text"] = newsgroups.data
raw_data["target"] = [newsgroups.target_names[x] for x in newsgroups.target]
```

Because of the 8k input token limit, in this example you will exclude all documents that have a length outside this limit.

Even though tokens typically are >=1 characters, for simplicity, you can just filter for documents that have <= 8000 _characters_.


```
filtered = raw_data.loc[raw_data["text"].str.len() <= 8000]
```

Subsample the dataset into 500 data points, stratified on the label


```
x_subsample, _, y_subsample, _ = train_test_split(
    raw_data["text"], raw_data["target"], stratify=raw_data["target"], train_size=500
)
```

Clean out the text removing by emails, names, etc. This will help improve the data that will then be converted into embeddings.


```
x_subsample = [re.sub(r"[\w\.-]+@[\w\.-]+", "", d) for d in x_subsample]  # Remove email
x_subsample = [re.sub(r"\([^()]*\)", "", d) for d in x_subsample]  # Remove names
x_subsample = [d.replace("From: ", "") for d in x_subsample]  # Remove "From: "
x_subsample = [
    d.replace("\nSubject: ", "") for d in x_subsample
]  # Remove "\nSubject: "
```


```
df = pd.DataFrame()
df["text"] = x_subsample
df["target"] = list(y_subsample)
```

You now have 500 data points roughly evenly distributed across the categories:


```
df["target"].value_counts()
```

## Create and visualize the embeddings using a t-SNE plot

Load the text embedding model from Vertex AI ([documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/model-reference/text-embeddings)).


```
model = TextEmbeddingModel.from_pretrained("textembedding-gecko@001")
```


```
# Retrieve embeddings from the specified model with retry logic


def make_embed_text_fn(model):
    @retry.Retry(timeout=300.0)
    def embed_fn(text):
        return model.get_embeddings([text])[0].values

    return embed_fn
```

Create the embeddings. This may take a minute or two.


```
df["embeddings"] = df["text"].progress_apply(make_embed_text_fn(model))
```


```
df.head()
```

The vectors generate by our model are 768 dimensions, and so visualizing across 768 dimensions is impossible. Instead, you can use [t-SNE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding) to reduce to 2 dimensions.


```
embeddings_array = np.array(df["embeddings"].to_list(), dtype=np.float32)
tsne = TSNE(random_state=0, n_iter=1000)
tsne_results = tsne.fit_transform(embeddings_array)
```


```
df_tsne = pd.DataFrame(tsne_results, columns=["TSNE1", "TSNE2"])
df_tsne["target"] = df["target"]  # Add labels column from df_train to df_tsne
```


```
df_tsne.head()
```

Plot the data points. It should now be visually clear how the documents from the same newsgroup show up close to each other in the vector space with text embeddings.


```
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 6))  # Set figsize
sns.set_style("darkgrid", {"grid.color": ".6", "grid.linestyle": ":"})
sns.scatterplot(data=df_tsne, x="TSNE1", y="TSNE2", hue="target", palette="hls")
sns.move_legend(ax, "upper left", bbox_to_anchor=(1, 1))
plt.title("Scatter plot of news using t-SNE")
plt.xlabel("TSNE1")
plt.ylabel("TSNE2")
plt.axis("equal")
```

# Gemini API: Embeddings Quickstart

<table align="left">
  <td>
    <a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Embeddings.ipynb"><img src="../images/colab_logo_32px.png" />Run in Google Colab</a>
  </td>
</table>

The Gemini API generates state-of-the-art text embeddings. An embedding is a list of floating point numbers that represent the meaning of a word, sentence, or paragraph. You can use embeddings in many downstream applications like document search.

This notebook provides quick code examples that show you how to get started generating embeddings.


```
!pip install -q -U "google-generativeai>=0.7.2"
```


```
import google.generativeai as genai
```

## Configure your API key

To run the following cell, your API key must be stored it in a Colab Secret named `GOOGLE_API_KEY`. If you don't already have an API key, or you're not sure how to create a Colab Secret, see  [Authentication](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Authentication.ipynb) for an example.


```
from google.colab import userdata
GOOGLE_API_KEY=userdata.get('GOOGLE_API_KEY')
genai.configure(api_key=GOOGLE_API_KEY)
```

## Embed content

Call the `embed_content` method with the `models/text-embedding-004` model to generate text embeddings.


```
text = "Hello world"
result = genai.embed_content(model="models/text-embedding-004", content=text)

# Print just a part of the embedding to keep the output manageable
print(str(result['embedding'])[:50], '... TRIMMED]')
```

    [0.013168523, -0.008711934, -0.046782676, 0.000699 ... TRIMMED]
    


```
print(len(result['embedding'])) # The embeddings have 768 dimensions
```

    768
    

## Batch embed content

You can embed a list of multiple prompts with one API call for efficiency.


```
result = genai.embed_content(
    model="models/text-embedding-004",
    content=[
      'What is the meaning of life?',
      'How much wood would a woodchuck chuck?',
      'How does the brain work?'])

for embedding in result['embedding']:
  print(str(embedding)[:50], '... TRIMMED]')
```

    [-0.010632277, 0.019375855, 0.0209652, 0.000770642 ... TRIMMED]
    [0.018467998, 0.0054281196, -0.017658804, 0.013859 ... TRIMMED]
    [0.05808907, 0.020941721, -0.108728774, -0.0403925 ... TRIMMED]
    

## Truncating embeddings

The `text-embedding-004` model also supports lower embedding dimensions. Specify `output_dimensionality` to truncate the output.


```
# Not truncated
result1 = genai.embed_content(
    model="models/text-embedding-004",
    content="Hello world")


# Truncated
result2 = genai.embed_content(
    model="models/text-embedding-004",
    content="Hello world",
    output_dimensionality=10)


(len(result1['embedding']), len(result2['embedding']))
```




    (768, 10)



## Specify `task_type`

Let's look at all the parameters the `embed_content` method takes. There are five:

* `model`: Required. Must be `models/text-embedding-004` or `models/embedding-001`.
* `content`: Required. The content that you would like to embed.
*`task_type`: Optional. The task type for which the embeddings will be used.
* `title`: Optional. You should only set this parameter if your task type is `retrieval_document` (or `document`).
* `output_dimensionality`: Optional. Reduced dimension for the output embedding. If set, excessive values in the output embedding are truncated from the end. This is supported by `models/text-embedding-004`, but cannot be specified in `models/embedding-001`.

`task_type` is an optional parameter that provides a hint to the API about how you intend to use the embeddings in your application.

The following task_type parameters are accepted:

* `unspecified`: If you do not set the value, it will default to `retrieval_query`.

## Set the output dimensionality
If you're using `text-embeddings-004`, you can set the `output_dimensionality` parameter to create smaller embeddings.

* `output_dimensionality` truncates the embedding (e.g., `[1, 3, 5]` becomes `[1,3]` when `output_dimensionality=2`).



```bash
%%bash

curl "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/text-embedding-004:embedContent?key=$GOOGLE_API_KEY" \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{"model": "models/text-embedding-004",
    "output_dimensionality":256,
    "content": {
    "parts":[{
      "text": "Hello world"}]}, }' 2> /dev/null | head
```

    {
      "embedding": {
        "values": [
          0.013168523,
          -0.008711934,
          -0.046782676,
          0.00069968984,
          -0.009518873,
          -0.008720178,
          0.060103577,
    

## Use `task_type` to provide a hint to the model how you'll use the embeddings

Let's look at all the parameters the embed_content method takes. There are four:

* `model`: Required. Must be `models/embedding-001`.
* `content`: Required. The content that you would like to embed.
* `task_type`: Optional. The task type for which the embeddings will be used. See below for possible values.
* `title`: The given text is a document from a corpus being searched. Optionally, set the `title` parameter with the title of the document. Can only be set when `task_type` is `RETRIEVAL_DOCUMENT`.

`task_type` is an optional parameter that provides a hint to the API about how you intend to use the embeddings in your application.

The following task_type parameters are accepted:

* `TASK_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED`: If you do not set the value, it will default to retrieval_query.
* `RETRIEVAL_QUERY` : The given text is a query in a search/retrieval setting.
* `RETRIEVAL_DOCUMENT`: The given text is a document from the corpus being searched.
* `SEMANTIC_SIMILARITY`: The given text will be used for Semantic Textual Similarity (STS).
* `CLASSIFICATION`: The given text will be classified.
* `CLUSTERING`: The embeddings will be used for clustering.



```bash
%%bash

curl "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/embedding-001:embedContent?key=$GOOGLE_API_KEY" \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{"model": "models/text-embedding-004",
    "content": {
    "parts":[{

## Embedding texts that are longer than the model's maximum context length
OpenAI's embedding models cannot embed text that exceeds a maximum length. The maximum length varies by model, and is measured by _tokens_, not string length. If you are unfamiliar with tokenization, check out [How to count tokens with tiktoken](How_to_count_tokens_with_tiktoken.ipynb).

This notebook shows how to handle texts that are longer than a model's maximum context length. We'll demonstrate using embeddings from `text-embedding-ada-002`, but the same ideas can be applied to other models and tasks. To learn more about embeddings, check out the [OpenAI Embeddings Guide](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings).

## Installation
Install the Azure Open AI SDK using the below command.


```csharp
#r "nuget: Azure.AI.OpenAI, 1.0.0-beta.14"
```


<div><div></div><div></div><div><strong>Installed Packages</strong><ul><li><span>Azure.AI.OpenAI, 1.0.0-beta.14</span></li></ul></div></div>



```csharp
#r "nuget:Microsoft.DotNet.Interactive.AIUtilities, 1.0.0-beta.24129.1"
```


```csharp
using Microsoft.DotNet.Interactive;
using Microsoft.DotNet.Interactive.AIUtilities;
```

## Run this cell, it will prompt you for the apiKey, endPoint, and embedding deployment


```csharp
var azureOpenAIKey = await Kernel.GetPasswordAsync("Provide your OPEN_AI_KEY");

// Your endpoint should look like the following https://YOUR_OPEN_AI_RESOURCE_NAME.openai.azure.com/
var azureOpenAIEndpoint = await Kernel.GetInputAsync("Provide the OPEN_AI_ENDPOINT");

// Enter the deployment name you chose when you deployed the model.
var deployment = await Kernel.GetInputAsync("Provide embedding deployment name");
```

### Import namesapaces and create an instance of `OpenAiClient` using the `azureOpenAIEndpoint` and the `azureOpenAIKey`


```csharp
using Azure;
using Azure.AI.OpenAI;
using System.Collections.Generic;
```


```csharp
OpenAIClient client = new (new Uri(azureOpenAIEndpoint), new AzureKeyCredential(azureOpenAIKey.GetClearTextPassword()));
```


```csharp
var longText = string.Join(" ", Enumerable.Repeat("AGI", 5000));
```

## Run the following cell

It will display and error like:
```
Azure.RequestFailedException: This model's maximum context length is 8191 tokens, however you requested 10000 tokens (10000 in your prompt; 0 for the completion). Please reduce your prompt; or completion length.

Status: 400 (model_error)

Content:

{

  "error": {

    "message": "This model's maximum context length is 8191 tokens, however you requested 10000 tokens (10000 in your prompt; 0 for the completion). Please reduce your prompt; or completion length.",

    "type": "invalid_request_error",

    "param": null,

    "code": null

  }

}
```

This shows that we have crossed the limit of `8191` tokens.


```csharp
var embeddingResponse = await client.GetEmbeddingsAsync(new EmbeddingsOptions(deployment, new []{ longText }));
```

Clearly we want to avoid these errors, particularly when handling programmatically with a large number of embeddings. Yet, we still might be faced with texts that are longer than the maximum context length. Below we describe and provide recipes for the main approaches to handling these longer texts: (1) simply truncating the text to the maximum allowed length, and (2) chunking the text and embedding each chunk individually.

## 1. Truncating the input text
The simplest solution is to truncate the input text to the maximum allowed length. Because the context length is measured in tokens, we have to first tokenize the text before truncating it. The API accepts inputs both in the form of text or tokens, so as long as you are careful that you are using the appropriate encoding, there is no need to convert the tokens back into string form. Below is an example of such a truncation function.


```csharp
var tokenizer = await Tokenizer.CreateAsync(TokenizerModel.ada2);
var truncated = tokenizer.TruncateByTokenCount(longText, 8191);
longText.Length.Display();
truncated.Length.Display();
```

}

    vertical-align: top; 

    margin: 0em 0px;

}

table tr td pre 

{ 

    vertical-align: top !important; 

    margin: 0em 0px !important;

} 

table th {

    text-align: start;

}

</style>



<div class="dni-plaintext"><pre>16382</pre></div><style>

.dni-code-hint {

    font-style: italic;

    overflow: hidden;

    white-space: nowrap;

}

.dni-treeview {

    white-space: nowrap;

}

.dni-treeview td {

    vertical-align: top;

    text-align: start;

}

details.dni-treeview {

    padding-left: 1em;

}

table td {

    text-align: start;

}

table tr { 

    vertical-align: top; 

    margin: 0em 0px;

}

table tr td pre 

{ 

    vertical-align: top !important; 

    margin: 0em 0px !important;

} 

table th {

    text-align: start;

}

</style>


## 2. Chunking the input text
Though truncation works, discarding potentially relevant text is a clear drawback. Another approach is to divide the input text into chunks and then embed each chunk individually. Then, we can either use the chunk embeddings separately, or combine them in some way, such as averaging (weighted by the size of each chunk).

Now we define a function that encodes a string into tokens and then breaks it up into chunks.

Finally, we can write a function that safely handles embedding requests, even when the input text is longer than the maximum context length, by chunking the input tokens and embedding each chunk individually. The `average` flag can be set to `True` to return the weighted average of the chunk embeddings, or `False` to simply return the unmodified list of chunk embeddings.


```csharp
var textChunks = tokenizer.ChunkByTokenCount( longText, 2000, true).ToList();
textChunks.Count.Display();
```


<div class="dni-plaintext"><pre>5</pre></div><style>

.dni-code-hint {

    font-style: italic;

    overflow: hidden;

    white-space: nowrap;

}

.dni-treeview {

    white-space: nowrap;

}

.dni-treeview td {

    vertical-align: top;

    text-align: start;

}

details.dni-treeview {

    padding-left: 1em;

}

table td {

    text-align: start;

}

table tr { 

    vertical-align: top; 

    margin: 0em 0px;

}

table tr td pre 

{ 

    vertical-align: top !important; 

    margin: 0em 0px !important;

} 

table th {

    text-align: start;

}

</style>



```csharp
foreach(var chunk in textChunks.Chunk(16)){
    var embeddings = await client.GetEmbeddingsAsync(new EmbeddingsOptions(deployment, chunk));
    embeddings.Value.Data.Display();
}

## Embedding Wikipedia articles for search
This notebook gives an example on how to get embeddings from a large dataset.
This notebook shows how we prepared a dataset of Wikipedia articles for search, used in [Question_answering_using_embeddings.ipynb](Question_answering_using_embeddings.ipynb).

## Installation
Install the Azure Open AI SDK using the below command.


```csharp
#r "nuget: Azure.AI.OpenAI, 1.0.0-beta.14"
```


<div><div></div><div></div><div><strong>Installed Packages</strong><ul><li><span>Azure.AI.OpenAI, 1.0.0-beta.14</span></li></ul></div></div>



```csharp
using Microsoft.DotNet.Interactive;
```

## Run this cell, it will prompt you for the apiKey, endPoint, and embedding deployment


```csharp
var azureOpenAIKey = await Kernel.GetPasswordAsync("Provide your OPEN_AI_KEY");

// Your endpoint should look like the following https://YOUR_OPEN_AI_RESOURCE_NAME.openai.azure.com/
var azureOpenAIEndpoint = await Kernel.GetInputAsync("Provide the OPEN_AI_ENDPOINT");

// Enter the deployment name you chose when you deployed the model.
var deployment = await Kernel.GetInputAsync("Provide EMBEDDING deployment name");
```

### Import namesapaces and create an instance of `OpenAiClient` using the `azureOpenAIEndpoint` and the `azureOpenAIKey`


```csharp
using Azure;
using Azure.AI.OpenAI;
```


```csharp
OpenAIClient client = new (new Uri(azureOpenAIEndpoint), new AzureKeyCredential(azureOpenAIKey.GetClearTextPassword()));
```

## 1. Collect documents
In this example, we'll download a few hundred Wikipedia articles related to the 2022 Winter Olympics.


```csharp
#r "nuget: CXuesong.MW.WikiClientLibrary, 0.7.5"
#r "nuget: CXuesong.MW.MwParserFromScratch, 0.2.1"
```


<div><div></div><div></div><div><strong>Installed Packages</strong><ul><li><span>CXuesong.MW.MwParserFromScratch, 0.2.1</span></li><li><span>CXuesong.MW.WikiClientLibrary, 0.7.5</span></li></ul></div></div>



```csharp
using WikiClientLibrary;
using WikiClientLibrary.Client;
using WikiClientLibrary.Sites;
using WikiClientLibrary.Pages;
using WikiClientLibrary.Pages.Queries;
using WikiClientLibrary.Pages.Queries.Properties;
using WikiClientLibrary.Generators;

var wikiClient = new WikiClient
    {
        ClientUserAgent = "WCLQuickStart/1.0 (your user name or contact information here)"
    };

var site = new WikiSite(wikiClient, await WikiSite.SearchApiEndpointAsync(wikiClient, "en.wikipedia.org"));
await site.Initialization;
        

var contentPages = new List<WikiPage>();

var generator = new CategoryMembersGenerator(site, "2022 Winter Olympics") { PaginationSize = 50, MemberTypes = CategoryMemberTypes.Page }  ;
var pages = await generator.EnumPagesAsync(PageQueryOptions.FetchContent).ToListAsync();

foreach (var page in pages)
{
    contentPages.Add(page);
}

Console.WriteLine($"Total pages: {contentPages.Count}");


```

    Total pages: 17




```csharp
using System.Text.RegularExpressions;

public bool Filter(string text){
    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(text)){
        return false;
    }
    if(Regex.IsMatch(text, @"\{\|\s*class=\s*""wikitable")){
        return false;
    }

    return true;
}
```

Next, we'll recursively split long sections into smaller sections.
There's no perfect recipe for splitting text into sections.
Some tradeoffs include:
 - Longer sections may be better for questions that require more context
 - Longer sections may be worse for retrieval, as they may have more topics muddled together
 - Shorter sections are better for reducing costs (which are proportional to the number of tokens)
 - Overlapping sections may help prevent answers from being cut by section boundaries

 Here, we'll use a simple approach and limit sections to 1,600 tokens each, recursively halving any sections that are too long.


```csharp
#r "nuget:Microsoft.DotNet.Interactive.AIUtilities, 1.0.0-beta.24129.1"
```


```csharp
using Microsoft.DotNet.Interactive.AIUtilities;

var tokenizer = await Tokenizer.CreateAsync(TokenizerModel.ada2);
```


```csharp
using MwParserFromScratch;
using MwParserFromScratch.Nodes;

record PageBlockWithEmbeddings(string PageTitle, string Block, float[] Embedding);
var parser = new WikitextParser();
var pageBlocks = new List<PageBlockWithEmbeddings>();
foreach (var page in contentPages) {
    var content = page.Content;
    var ast = parser.Parse(content);
    
    // split page into block
    var blocks = ast.EnumChildren().OfType<Paragraph>().Where(p => Filter(p.ToPlainText())).Select(b => b.ToPlainText()).ToList();
    foreach(var block in blocks){
        //split blocks by 1600 tokens
        var blockChunks = tokenizer.ChunkByTokenCountWithOverlap(block, 1600, 10, true).ToArray();

        // generate embeddings
        foreach(var chunk in blockChunks.Chunk(16)) {
            var response = await client.GetEmbeddingsAsync(new EmbeddingsOptions(deployment, chunk));
            foreach( var embeddingItem in response.Value.Data){
                    var embedding = embeddingItem.Embedding.ToArray();
                    var blockWithEmbeddings = new PageBlockWithEmbeddings(page.Title, chunk[embeddingItem.Index], embedding);
                    pageBlocks.Add(blockWithEmbeddings);
                }
        }
    }
}

```


```csharp
pageBlocks.Count.Display();
```

# Meta Prompting: A Guide to Automated Prompt Optimization

Welcome to our cookbook on meta prompting! In this guide, we'll explore how to take a basic prompt and refine it to enhance the quality of outputs from a language model. We'll use the example of summarizing news reports to illustrate the process.


Meta-prompting is a technique where you use an LLM to generate or improve prompts. Typically this is done using a higher intelligence model that optimizes prompts for a model with less intelligence. It’s a process of using prompts to guide, structure, and optimize other prompts, helping ensure they’re more effective in guiding the LLM towards high-quality, relevant outputs. We'll be leveraging the capabilities of `o1-preview`, a more intelligent model with advanced reasoning skills, to improve a prompt for `gpt-4o`.

We're committed to making your development journey with LLMs smoother and more accessible through this technique. Don't forget to check out our [Generate Anything](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-generation) feature in the playground — it's a fantastic starting point to dive into meta prompting.

In this example, we'll begin with a simple prompt for summarizing news articles and then enhance it to see how the outputs improve. We'll use `o1-preview` to analyze and refine our prompt, adding more detail and clarity along the way. Finally, we'll evaluate the outputs systematically to understand the impact of our refinements.


```python
import pandas as pd
import openai 
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor, as_completed
from tqdm import tqdm
from pydantic import BaseModel
from datasets import load_dataset

client = openai.Client()
```

      from .autonotebook import tqdm as notebook_tqdm
    

## Importing the Data

Let's kick things off by importing the `bbc_news_alltime` dataset from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/RealTimeData/bbc_news_alltime). This dataset contains all BBC News articles, capturing everything published monthly from 2017 up to the latest complete month. For our experiment, we'll focus exclusively on a sample from a recent month—August 2024—to keep things current and manageable.



```python
ds = load_dataset("RealTimeData/bbc_news_alltime", "2024-08")
df = pd.DataFrame(ds['train']).sample(n=100, random_state=1)
df.head()
```

## Iterating on Prompts


Let's start with a straightforward prompt and then use `o1-preview` to enhance it for better results. We want to summarize news articles, so this is what i'll ask the model to do. 


```python
simple_prompt = "Summarize this news article: {article}"

```

To improve the prompt, we need to provide `o1-preview` with the context and goals we want to achieve. We can then ask it to generate a more detailed prompt that would produce richer and more comprehensive news summaries.


```python
meta_prompt = """
Improve the following prompt to generate a more detailed summary. 
Adhere to prompt engineering best practices. 
Make sure the structure is clear and intuitive and contains the type of news, tags and sentiment analysis.

{simple_prompt}

Only return the prompt.
"""
```


```python
def get_model_response(messages, model="o1-preview"):
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        messages=messages,
        model=model,
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content


complex_prompt = get_model_response([{"role": "user", "content": meta_prompt.format(simple_prompt=simple_prompt)}])
complex_prompt
```




    'Please read the following news article and provide a comprehensive summary that includes:\n\n1. **Type of News**: Specify the category of the news article (e.g., Politics, Technology, Health, Sports, etc.).\n2. **Summary**: Write a concise and clear summary of the main points, ensuring the structure is logical and intuitive.\n3. **Tags**: List relevant keywords or tags associated with the article.\n4. **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze the overall sentiment of the article (positive, negative, or neutral) and briefly explain your reasoning.\n\n**Article:**\n\n{article}'



## Generating the Summaries

Now that we have both prompts, let's generate the summaries! For each entry in our dataset, we'll use both the simple and the enhanced prompts to see how they compare. By doing this, we'll get a firsthand look at how our refinements with `o1-preview` can lead to richer and more detailed summaries. Let's dive in and see the difference for ourselves!


```python
def generate_response(prompt): 
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    response = get_model_response(messages, model="gpt-4o-mini")
    return response

def generate_summaries(row):
    simple_itinerary = generate_response(simple_prompt.format(article=row["content"]))
    complex_itinerary = generate_response(complex_prompt + row["content"])
    return simple_itinerary, complex_itinerary
```

Let's check if everything looks good and if we can generate a summary for the first news report. 


```python
generate_summaries(df.iloc[0])
```




    ('Television presenter Laura Whitmore has shared that the issues she attempted to address during her time on *Strictly Come Dancing* eight years ago are now surfacing, stating that she experienced "gaslighting" that made her concerns seem normalized. In a recent interview, she expressed the difficulties she faced, including being portrayed negatively and feeling "broken" during the competition. Whitmore indicated that she raised concerns about inappropriate behavior and is currently providing evidence for a BBC investigation, although she has not made an official complaint herself. The BBC is facing allegations of mistreatment towards contestants, prompting them to announce new welfare measures, including the presence of a chaperone during rehearsals. Other celebrities participating in the show have also made allegations against professional dancers, leading to growing scrutiny around conditions on the show. The BBC emphasized that it takes complaints very seriously and is committed to updating its support processes.',
     '1. **Type of News**: Entertainment\n\n2. **Summary**: Laura Whitmore, a television presenter, has spoken out about her experiences on Strictly Come Dancing, revealing that issues she attempted to address during her tenure on the show are now coming to light. In an interview with The Irish Times, she described feeling "gaslit" and suggested that her concerns, which she raised eight years ago, were not taken seriously at the time. Whitmore recalled that her participation left her feeling "broken" and criticized how she was portrayed during the show. She mentioned contributing evidence to an ongoing review involving incidents of alleged inappropriate behavior during her time on the show, although she did not make an official complaint. The BBC, which has been navigating its own controversy related to the treatment of contestants, stated it is taking these claims seriously and plans to enhance welfare measures on the show, including the introduction of a chaperone at rehearsals. Recent allegations from other contestants have further intensified the scrutiny of Strictly Come Dancing.\n\n3. **Tags**: Laura Whitmore, Strictly Come Dancing, BBC, allegations, inappropriate behavior, gaslighting, welfare measures, entertainment controversy\n\n4. **Sentiment Analysis**: The overall sentiment of the article is negative. It highlights serious allegations of mistreatment and inappropriate behavior associated with a popular television show, along with personal accounts from Whitmore that reflect emotional distress and professional struggles. The tone conveys a sense of urgency and seriousness regarding the issues raised, indicating a critical atmosphere within the entertainment industry related to contestant treatment.')



By comparing the summaries generated from the simple and enhanced prompts, we can already see significant improvements. The initial summary gives us a general overview of the article, whereas the enhanced summary dives deeper — it not only provides a detailed summary but also categorizes the news type, lists relevant tags, and even includes a sentiment analysis.

Let's test on the entire dataset now! 


```python
# Add new columns to the dataframe for storing itineraries
df['simple_summary'] = None
df['complex_summary'] = None

# Use ThreadPoolExecutor to generate itineraries concurrently
with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
    futures = {executor.submit(generate_summaries, row): index for index, row in df.iterrows()}
    for future in tqdm(as_completed(futures), total=len(futures), desc="Generating Itineraries"):
        index = futures[future]
        simple_itinerary, complex_itinerary = future.result()
        df.at[index, 'simple_summary'] = simple_itinerary
        df.at[index, 'complex_summary'] = complex_itinerary

df.head()
```

## Evaluating the Results

To assess the difference in performance between the two prompts, we'll use a structured evaluation approach with the LLM acting as a judge. This means we'll leverage the language model itself to evaluate and compare the outputs based on specific criteria.

**What Does "LLM as a Judge" Mean?**

Using an LLM as a judge involves having the language model evaluate its own outputs or those of another model. It applies predefined criteria to assess aspects like accuracy, clarity, and relevance. This approach helps us obtain an objective and consistent evaluation without human bias, making it easier to identify improvements between different prompts. Our cookbook on [Getting Started with OpenAI Evals](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/evaluation/getting_started_with_openai_evals) offers a glimps on how you can get started with this approach.


Here's the prompt we'll use for evaluation:


```python
evaluation_prompt = """
You are an expert editor tasked with evaluating the quality of a news article summary. Below is the original article and the summary to be evaluated:

**Original Article**:  
{original_article}

**Summary**:  
{summary}

Please evaluate the summary based on the following criteria, using a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being the lowest and 5 being the highest). Be critical in your evaluation and only give high scores for exceptional summaries:

1. **Categorization and Context**: Does the summary clearly identify the type or category of news (e.g., Politics, Technology, Sports) and provide appropriate context?  
2. **Keyword and Tag Extraction**: Does the summary include relevant keywords or tags that accurately capture the main topics and themes of the article?  
3. **Sentiment Analysis**: Does the summary accurately identify the overall sentiment of the article and provide a clear, well-supported explanation for this sentiment?  
4. **Clarity and Structure**: Is the summary clear, well-organized, and structured in a way that makes it easy to understand the main points?  
5. **Detail and Completeness**: Does the summary provide a detailed account that includes all necessary components (type of news, tags, sentiment) comprehensively?  


Provide your scores and justifications for each criterion, ensuring a rigorous and detailed evaluation.
"""

class ScoreCard(BaseModel):
    categorization: int
    keyword_extraction: int
    sentiment_analysis: int
    clarity_structure: int
    detail_completeness: int
    justification: str
```

Here's a pro tip — you can actually use meta prompting to refine your evaluation prompt as well! By applying the same iterative enhancement to the prompt that instructs the LLM to act as a judge, you can make your evaluations even more precise and insightful. 

Let's use this prompt to evaluate our summaries!


```python
def evaluate_summaries(row):
    simple_messages = [{"role": "user", "content": evaluation_prompt.format(original_article=row["content"], summary=row['simple_summary'])}]
    complex_messages = [{"role": "user", "content": evaluation_prompt.format(original_article=row["content"], summary=row['complex_summary'])}]
    
    simple_summary = client.beta.chat.completions.parse(
        model="gpt-4o",
        messages=simple_messages,
        response_format=ScoreCard)
    simple_summary = simple_summary.choices[0].message.parsed
    
    complex_summary = client.beta.chat.completions.parse(
        model="gpt-4o",
        messages=complex_messages,
        response_format=ScoreCard)
    complex_summary = complex_summary.choices[0].message.parsed
    
    return simple_summary, complex_summary

# Add new columns to the dataframe for storing evaluations
df['simple_evaluation'] = None
df['complex_evaluation'] = None

# Use ThreadPoolExecutor to evaluate itineraries concurrently
with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
    futures = {executor.submit(evaluate_summaries, row): index for index, row in df.iterrows()}
    for future in tqdm(as_completed(futures), total=len(futures), desc="Evaluating Summaries"):
        index = futures[future]
        simple_evaluation, complex_evaluation = future.result()
        df.at[index, 'simple_evaluation'] = simple_evaluation
        df.at[index, 'complex_evaluation'] = complex_evaluation

df.head()

After evaluating the results, we found that while the basic prompt performed well in clarity and structure, the enhanced prompt significantly improved outputs across several other key criteria: Categorization, Keywords and Tags, Sentiment Analysis, and Detail and Completeness. The complex prompt led to summaries that were more informative, better organized, and richer in content.

This demonstrates how refining prompts can greatly enhance the quality of the generated summaries. Although this is a simplified example, the benefits of prompt optimization are expected to be even more pronounced in real-world, production-level applications, leading to outputs that are more aligned with specific goals and user needs.

## Conclusion

Meta prompting is a powerful technique that can significantly enhance the quality of outputs from language models. Our exploration showed that starting with a simple prompt and refining it using `o1-preview` led to summaries that were more informative, better organized, and richer in content—improving across key criteria like categorization, keywords and tags, sentiment analysis, and completeness. This exercise underscores the value of prompt optimization, and even in this simplified example, the benefits are clear. In real-world applications, leveraging meta prompting and tools like `o1-preview` can elevate language model performance to better meet your specific goals and user needs.

## Overview

### Vertex Gen AI Evaluation API

The [Vertex Gen AI Evaluation Service](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/models/evaluation-overview) which can be accessed both through its SDK and web API interfaces, lets you evaluate your large language models (LLMs), both pointwise and pairwise, across several metrics.

It is primarily used ad-hoc in the initial experimental phase for evaluating which set of prompts and models work well for a use case. However, as described in detail in the corresponding blog, this notebook will show some sample code on dummy data of how you can use 
Evaluation to enhance the quality of the response generated by the LLMs by combining the pairwise and pointwise capabilities of Gen AI Evaluation elegantly at the time of generation. It would also then return a human readable explanation to help understand the quality evaluation of the response. Note that although this notebook only demonstrates this workflow on text, it can be extended to any modality once an evaluation mechanism is available for that modality.

For more information about generative AI on Vertex AI please see [Generative AI on Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/learn/overview) documentation.

### Objectives

In this tutorial, you will learn how to combine the Gemini API in Vertex AI  with the Gen AI Eval API service for Python to improve generation quality & explainability of the responses.
You will complete the following tasks:

- Install the Vertex AI SDK for Python
- Use the Gemini API in Vertex AI to interact with each model
  - Gemini 1.5 Pro (`gemini-1.5-pro`) model:
    - Generate multiple responses for a given instruction and context
    - Use the pairwise and pointwise capabilities of eval to select the best response and also return a human readable explanation for it. 

### Costs

This tutorial uses billable components of Google Cloud:

- Vertex AI

Learn about [Vertex AI pricing](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/pricing) and use the [Pricing Calculator](https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator/) to generate a cost estimate based on your projected usage.

## Getting Started

### Install the required libraries for Python


```
%pip install --upgrade --user --quiet google-cloud-aiplatform[evaluation]
%pip install --upgrade --user bigframes -q
%pip install --quiet --upgrade nest_asyncio
```

### Restart current runtime

To use the newly installed packages in this Jupyter runtime, it is recommended to restart the runtime. Run the following cell to restart the current kernel.

The restart process might take a minute or so.


```
import IPython

app = IPython.Application.instance()
app.kernel.do_shutdown(True)
```

#### Set your project ID and region


```
PROJECT_ID = "[your-project-id]"
LOCATION = "us-central1"
```

After the restart is complete, continue to the next step.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning">
<b>⚠️ Wait for the kernel to finish restarting before you continue. ⚠️</b>
</div>

### Authenticate your notebook environment (Colab only)

If you are running this notebook on Google Colab, run the following cell to authenticate your environment. This step is not required if you are using [Vertex AI Workbench](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai-workbench).


```
import sys

# Additional authentication is required for Google Colab
if "google.colab" in sys.modules:
    # Authenticate user to Google Cloud
    from google.colab import auth

    auth.authenticate_user()
```

### Define Google Cloud project information (Colab only)

If you are running this notebook on Google Colab, specify the Google Cloud project information to use. In the following cell, you specify your project information, import the Vertex AI package, and initialize the package. This step is not required if you are using [Vertex AI Workbench](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai-workbench).


```
if "google.colab" in sys.modules:
    # Define project information
    # Initialize Vertex AI
    import vertexai

    vertexai.init(project=PROJECT_ID, location=LOCATION)
```

### Import libraries & initialize project variables


```
import functools
from functools import partial
import uuid

from google.cloud import aiplatform
import nest_asyncio
import pandas as pd
from vertexai.evaluation import EvalTask, MetricPromptTemplateExamples
from vertexai.generative_models import GenerationConfig, GenerativeModel

nest_asyncio.apply()
```

## Defining functions for ranking using evaluations

This section defines the various helper functions to perform pairwise and pointwise evaluations, as well as the logic to combine them 
to select the best response and return associated quality metrics and explanation.

This function simplifies AutoSXS comparisons between pairs of responses. It uses the Gen AI Evaluation Service API in Vertex AI and works well with Python's <code>max()</code> or <code>sorted()</code> functions. This lets you easily find the best response or rank a list of responses using pairwise comparisons. For other tasks, like summarization SxS, you can find a full list of metrics on the website mentioned below.

This function integrates pairwise and pointwise logic to enhance response selection and evaluation. Here's the process:

**Current Workflow**:

1. Pairwise Comparison: Compares responses in pairs to identify the best one based on user-defined metrics.
2. Pointwise Evaluation: Assesses the quality of the chosen response, providing human-readable explanations to build trust.

**Alternative Workflow**:

1. Pointwise Evaluation: Evaluate each response individually based on the Pointwise scores or likelihood/logprobs of the response, filtering out those that don't meet specific quality criteria or selecting the top K responses.
2. Pairwise Comparison: Ranks the remaining high-quality responses using pairwise methods to determine the best one(s).

**Key Points**

-  Combines pairwise and pointwise approaches for robust response selection.
-  Offers flexibility with two possible workflows to suit different needs.
-  Prioritizes response quality and provides explanations to support user confidence.

    The process consists of two steps:

    return pairwise_best_response, qa_metrics
```

### Load the Gemini 1.5 Pro model

Here we load the model, and assign a temperature value in the range `0.3` to `1.0` and configure it to generate multiple responses. A higher temperature value is critical, even for use cases where creativity is less important like Q & A: since de-correlated responses would mean if the model gets it wrong with the top choice for one response, it has a possibility of getting it right with one of the other responses


```
generation_model = GenerativeModel("gemini-1.5-pro-002")
generation_config = GenerationConfig(
    temperature=0.4, max_output_tokens=512, candidate_count=num_responses
)
```

### Prompt Gemini
Now we prompt Gemini to generate multiple slightly de-correlated responses based on the above configuration. Multiple responses will be generated in single call.


```
instruction_qa = "Please answer the following question based on the context provided. Question: what is the correct process of fixing your tires?"
context_qa = (
    "Context:\n"
    + "the world is a magical place and fixing tires is one of those magical tasks. According to the Administration and Association (TIA), the only method to properly repair a tire puncture is to fill the injury with a repair stem and back the stem with a repair patch. This is commonly known as a combination repair or a patch/plug repair."
)
prompt_qa = instruction_qa + "\n" + context_qa + "\n\nAnswer:\n"
responses = [
    candidate.text
    for candidate in generation_model.generate_content(
        contents=prompt_qa,
        generation_config=generation_config,
    ).candidates
]

prompt_qa
```

Here we use the `rank_responses()` function to fetch the best selected response as well as its associated quality metrics.


```
best_response, metrics = rank_responses(instruction_qa, context_qa, responses)
```

Now we print the various generated responses:
1. The raw responses generated by Gemini
2. The best performing response
3. Its associated pointwise quality metrics and explanation.


```
for ix, response in enumerate(responses, start=1):
    print(f"Response no. {ix}: \n {response}")
```


```
print(best_response)
```


```
metrics
```

# How to combine results from multiple retrievers

The [EnsembleRetriever](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/langchain/retrievers/langchain.retrievers.ensemble.EnsembleRetriever.html) supports ensembling of results from multiple retrievers. It is initialized with a list of [BaseRetriever](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/core/retrievers/langchain_core.retrievers.BaseRetriever.html) objects. EnsembleRetrievers rerank the results of the constituent retrievers based on the [Reciprocal Rank Fusion](https://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~gvcormac/cormacksigir09-rrf.pdf) algorithm.

By leveraging the strengths of different algorithms, the `EnsembleRetriever` can achieve better performance than any single algorithm. 

The most common pattern is to combine a sparse retriever (like BM25) with a dense retriever (like embedding similarity), because their strengths are complementary. It is also known as "hybrid search". The sparse retriever is good at finding relevant documents based on keywords, while the dense retriever is good at finding relevant documents based on semantic similarity.

## Basic usage

Below we demonstrate ensembling of a [BM25Retriever](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/retrievers/langchain_community.retrievers.bm25.BM25Retriever.html) with a retriever derived from the [FAISS vector store](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/vectorstores/langchain_community.vectorstores.faiss.FAISS.html).


```python
%pip install --upgrade --quiet  rank_bm25 > /dev/null
```


```python
from langchain.retrievers import EnsembleRetriever
from langchain_community.retrievers import BM25Retriever
from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings

doc_list_1 = [
    "I like apples",
    "I like oranges",
    "Apples and oranges are fruits",
]

# initialize the bm25 retriever and faiss retriever
bm25_retriever = BM25Retriever.from_texts(
    doc_list_1, metadatas=[{"source": 1}] * len(doc_list_1)
)
bm25_retriever.k = 2

doc_list_2 = [
    "You like apples",
    "You like oranges",
]

embedding = OpenAIEmbeddings()
faiss_vectorstore = FAISS.from_texts(
    doc_list_2, embedding, metadatas=[{"source": 2}] * len(doc_list_2)
)
faiss_retriever = faiss_vectorstore.as_retriever(search_kwargs={"k": 2})

# initialize the ensemble retriever
ensemble_retriever = EnsembleRetriever(
    retrievers=[bm25_retriever, faiss_retriever], weights=[0.5, 0.5]
)
```


```python
docs = ensemble_retriever.invoke("apples")
docs
```




    [Document(page_content='I like apples', metadata={'source': 1}),
     Document(page_content='You like apples', metadata={'source': 2}),
     Document(page_content='Apples and oranges are fruits', metadata={'source': 1}),
     Document(page_content='You like oranges', metadata={'source': 2})]



## Runtime Configuration

We can also configure the individual retrievers at runtime using [configurable fields](/docs/how_to/configure). Below we update the "top-k" parameter for the FAISS retriever specifically:


```python
from langchain_core.runnables import ConfigurableField

faiss_retriever = faiss_vectorstore.as_retriever(
    search_kwargs={"k": 2}
).configurable_fields(
    search_kwargs=ConfigurableField(
        id="search_kwargs_faiss",
        name="Search Kwargs",
        description="The search kwargs to use",
    )
)

ensemble_retriever = EnsembleRetriever(
    retrievers=[bm25_retriever, faiss_retriever], weights=[0.5, 0.5]
)
```


```python
config = {"configurable": {"search_kwargs_faiss": {"k": 1}}}
docs = ensemble_retriever.invoke("apples", config=config)
docs
```




    [Document(page_content='I like apples', metadata={'source': 1}),
     Document(page_content='You like apples', metadata={'source': 2}),
     Document(page_content='Apples and oranges are fruits', metadata={'source': 1})]



Notice that this only returns one source from the FAISS retriever, because we pass in the relevant configuration at run time


```python

```

# Data Annotation with Argilla Spaces
_Authored by: [Moritz Laurer](https://huggingface.co/MoritzLaurer)_

This notebook illustrates the workflow for systematically evaluating LLM outputs and creating LLM training data. You can start by using this notebook to evaluate the zero-shot performance of your favorite LLM on your task without any fine-tuning. If you want to improve performance, you can then easily reuse this workflow to create training data.

**Example use case: code generation.** In this tutorial, we demonstrate how to create high-quality test and train data for code generation tasks. The same workflow can, however, be adapted to any other task relevant to your specific use case.

**In this notebook, we:**
1. Download data for the example task.
2. Prompt two LLMs to respond to these tasks. This results in "synthetic data" to speed up manual data creation. 
3. Create an Argilla annotation interface on HF Spaces to compare and evaluate the outputs from the two LLMs.
4. Upload the example data and the zero-shot LLM responses into the Argilla annotation interface.
5. Download the annotated data.

You can adapt this notebook to your needs, e.g., using a different LLM and API provider for step (2) or adapting the annotation task in step (3).

## Install required packages and connect to HF Hub


```python
!pip install argilla~=2.0.0
!pip install transformers~=4.40.0
!pip install datasets~=2.19.0
!pip install huggingface_hub~=0.23.2
```


```python
# Login to the HF Hub. We recommend using this login method 
# to avoid the need to explicitly store your HF token in variables 
import huggingface_hub
!git config --global credential.helper store
huggingface_hub.login(add_to_git_credential=True)
```

## Download example task data

First, we download an example dataset containing LLMs' code generation tasks. We want to evaluate how well two different LLMs perform on these code-generation tasks. We use instructions from the [bigcode/self-oss-instruct-sc2-exec-filter-50k](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bigcode/self-oss-instruct-sc2-exec-filter-50k) dataset that was used to train the [StarCoder2-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/bigcode/starcoder2-15b-instruct-v0.1) model.


```python
from datasets import load_dataset

# Small sample for faster testing
dataset_codetask = load_dataset("bigcode/self-oss-instruct-sc2-exec-filter-50k", split="train[:3]")
print("Dataset structure:\n", dataset_codetask, "\n")

# We are only interested in the instructions/prompts provided in the dataset
instructions_lst = dataset_codetask["instruction"]
print("Example instructions:\n", instructions_lst[:2])
```

    Dataset structure:
     Dataset({
        features: ['fingerprint', 'sha1', 'seed', 'response', 'concepts', 'prompt', 'instruction', 'id'],
        num_rows: 3
    }) 
    
    Example instructions:
     ['Write a Python function named `get_value` that takes a matrix (represented by a list of lists) and a tuple of indices, and returns the value at that index in the matrix. The function should handle index out of range errors by returning None.', 'Write a Python function `check_collision` that takes a list of `rectangles` as input and checks if there are any collisions between any two rectangles. A rectangle is represented as a tuple (x, y, w, h) where (x, y) is the top-left corner of the rectangle, `w` is the width, and `h` is the height.\n\nThe function should return True if any pair of rectangles collide, and False otherwise. Use an iterative approach and check for collisions based on the bounding box collision detection algorithm. If a collision is found, return True immediately without checking for more collisions.']
    

## Prompt two LLMs on the example task

#### Formatting the instructions with a chat_template
Before sending the instructions to an LLM API, we need to format the instructions with the correct `chat_template` for each of the models we want to evaluate. This essentially entails wrapping some special tokens around the instructions. See the [docs](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/chat_templating) on chat templates for details.


```python
# Apply correct chat formatting to instructions from the dataset 
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

models_to_compare = ["mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1", "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct"]

def format_prompt(prompt, tokenizer):
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    messages_tokenized = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, tokenize=False, add_generation_prompt=True, return_tensors="pt")
    return messages_tokenized


prompts_formatted_dic = {}
for model in models_to_compare:
    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model)

    prompt_formatted = []
    for instruction in instructions_lst: 
        prompt_formatted.append(format_prompt(instruction, tokenizer))
        
    prompts_formatted_dic.update({model: prompt_formatted})


print(f"\nFirst prompt formatted for {models_to_compare[0]}:\n\n", prompts_formatted_dic[models_to_compare[0]][0], "\n\n")
print(f"First prompt formatted for {models_to_compare[1]}:\n\n", prompts_formatted_dic[models_to_compare[1]][0], "\n\n")

```

    None of PyTorch, TensorFlow >= 2.0, or Flax have been found. Models won't be available and only tokenizers, configuration and file/data utilities can be used.
    /home/user/miniconda/lib/python3.9/site-packages/huggingface_hub/file_download.py:1132: FutureWarning: `resume_download` is deprecated and will be removed in version 1.0.0. Downloads always resume when possible. If you want to force a new download, use `force_download=True`.
      warnings.warn(
    Special tokens have been added in the vocabulary, make sure the associated word embeddings are fine-tuned or trained.

     <s>[INST] Write a Python function named `get_value` that takes a matrix (represented by a list of lists) and a tuple of indices, and returns the value at that index in the matrix. The function should handle index out of range errors by returning None. [/INST] 
    
    
    First prompt formatted for meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct:
    
     <|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>
    
    Write a Python function named `get_value` that takes a matrix (represented by a list of lists) and a tuple of indices, and returns the value at that index in the matrix. The function should handle index out of range errors by returning None.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
    
     
    
    
    

#### Sending the instructions to the HF Inference API
Now, we can send the instructions to the APIs for both LLMs to get outputs we can evaluate. We first define some parameters for generating the responses correctly. Hugging Face's LLM APIs are powered by [Text Generation Inference (TGI)](https://huggingface.co/docs/text-generation-inference/index) containers. See the TGI OpenAPI specifications [here](https://huggingface.github.io/text-generation-inference/#/Text%20Generation%20Inference/generate) and the explanations of different parameters in the Transformers Generation Parameters [docs](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.30.0/main_classes/text_generation#transformers.GenerationConfig). 


```python
generation_params = dict(
    # we use low temperature and top_p to reduce creativity and increase likelihood of highly probable tokens
    temperature=0.2,
    top_p=0.60,
    top_k=None,
    repetition_penalty=1.0,
    do_sample=True,
    max_new_tokens=512*2,
    return_full_text=False,
    seed=42,
    #details=True,
    #stop=["<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|>"],
    #grammar={"type": "json"}
    max_time=None, 
    stream=False,
    use_cache=False,
    wait_for_model=False,
)
```

Now, we can make a standard API request to the Serverless Inference API ([docs](https://huggingface.co/docs/api-inference/index)). Note that the Serverless Inference API is mostly for testing and is rate-limited. For testing without rate limits, you can create your own API via the HF Dedicated Endpoints ([docs](https://huggingface.co/docs/inference-endpoints/index)). See also our corresponding tutorials in the [Open Source AI Cookbook](https://huggingface.co/learn/cookbook/index).

> [!TIP]
> The code below will be updated once the Inference API recipe is finished.


```python
import requests
from tqdm.auto import tqdm

# Hint: use asynchronous API calls (and dedicated endpoints) to increase speed
def query(payload=None, api_url=None):
    response = requests.post(api_url, headers=headers, json=payload)
    return response.json()

headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {huggingface_hub.get_token()}"}

output_dic = {}
for model in models_to_compare:
    # Create API urls for each model
    # When using dedicated endpoints, you can reuse the same code and simply replace this URL
    api_url = "https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/" + model
    
    # send requests to API 
    output_lst = []
    for prompt in tqdm(prompt_formatted):
        output = query(
            payload={
                "inputs": prompt,
                "parameters": {**generation_params}
            },
            api_url=api_url 
        )
        output_lst.append(output[0]["generated_text"])
    
    output_dic.update({model: output_lst})

print(f"---First generation of {models_to_compare[0]}:\n{output_dic[models_to_compare[0]][0]}\n\n")
print(f"---First generation of {models_to_compare[1]}:\n{output_dic[models_to_compare[1]][0]}")
```

    ---First generation of mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1:
    Here's a Python function that meets your requirements:
    
    ```python
    def get_value(matrix, indices):
        try:
            return matrix[indices[0]][indices[1]]
        except IndexError:
            return None
    ```
    
    This function takes a matrix (represented by a list of lists) and a tuple of indices as input. It first tries to access the value at the given indices in the matrix. If the indices are out of range, it catches the `IndexError` exception and returns `None`.
    
    
    ---First generation of meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct:
    Here is a Python function that does what you described:
    ```
    def get_value(matrix, indices):
        try:
            row, col = indices
            return matrix[row][col]
        except IndexError:
            return None
    ```
    Here's an explanation of how the function works:
    
    1. The function takes two arguments: `matrix` (a list of lists) and `indices` (a tuple of two integers, representing the row and column indices).
    2. The function tries to access the value at the specified indices using `matrix[row][col]`.
    3. If the indices are out of range (i.e., `row` or `col` is greater than the length of the corresponding dimension of the matrix), an `IndexError` exception is raised.
    4. The `except` block catches the `IndexError` exception and returns `None` instead of raising an error.
    
    Here's an example usage of the function:
    ```
    matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
    
    print(get_value(matrix, (0, 0)))  # prints 1
    print(get_value(matrix, (1, 1)))  # prints 5
    print(get_value(matrix, (3, 0)))  # prints None (out of range)
    print(get_value(matrix, (0, 3)))  # prints None (out of range)
    ```
    I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
    

#### Store the LLM outputs in a dataset
We can now store the LLM outputs in a dataset together with the original instructions.


```python
# create a HF dataset with the instructions and model outputs
from datasets import Dataset

dataset = Dataset.from_dict({
    "instructions": instructions_lst,
    "response_model_1": output_dic[models_to_compare[0]],
    "response_model_2": output_dic[models_to_compare[1]]
})

dataset
```




    Dataset({
        features: ['instructions', 'response_model_1', 'response_model_2'],
        num_rows: 3
    })



## Create and configure your Argilla dataset

We use [Argilla](https://argilla.io/), a collaboration tool for AI engineers and domain experts who need to build high-quality datasets for their projects.

We run Argilla via a HF Space, which you can set up with just a few clicks without any local setup. You can create the HF Argilla Space by following [these instructions](https://docs.argilla.io/latest/getting_started/quickstart/). For further configuration on HF Argilla Spaces, see also the detailed [documentation](https://docs.argilla.io/latest/getting_started/how-to-configure-argilla-on-huggingface/). If you want, you can also run Argilla locally via Argilla's docker containers (see [Argilla docs](https://docs.argilla.io/latest/getting_started/how-to-deploy-argilla-with-docker/)).

![Argilla login screen](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/cookbook-images/resolve/main/argilla-login-screen.png)

#### Programmatically interact with Argilla

Before we can tailor the dataset to our specific task and upload the data that will be shown in the UI, we need to first set up a few things.

**Connecting this notebook to Argilla:** We can now connect this notebook to Argilla to programmatically configure your dataset and upload/download data. 


```python
# After starting the Argilla Space (or local docker container) you can connect to the Space with the code below.
import argilla as rg

client = rg.Argilla(
    api_url="https://username-spacename.hf.space",  # Locally: "http://localhost:6900"
    api_key="your-apikey",  # You'll find it in the UI "My Settings > API key"
    # To use a private HF Argilla Space, also pass your HF token
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {huggingface_hub.get_token()}"},
)
```


```python
user = client.me
user
```

#### Write good annotator guidelines 
Writing good guidelines for your human annotators is just as important (and difficult) as writing good training code. Good instructions should fulfill the following criteria: 
- **Simple and clear**: The guidelines should be simple and clear to understand for people who do not know anything about your task yet. Always ask at least one colleague to reread the guidelines to make sure that there are no ambiguities. 
- **Reproducible and explicit**: All information for doing the annotation task should be contained in the guidelines. A common mistake is to create informal interpretations of the guidelines during conversations with selected annotators. Future annotators will not have this information and might do the task differently than intended if it is not made explicit in the guidelines.
- **Short and comprehensive**: The guidelines should as short as possible, while containing all necessary information. Annotators tend not to read long guidelines properly, so try to keep them as short as possible, while remaining comprehensive.

Note that creating annotator guidelines is an iterative process. It is good practice to do a few dozen annotations yourself and refine the guidelines based on your learnings from the data before assigning the task to others. Versioning the guidelines can also help as the task evolves over time. See further tips in this [blog post](https://argilla.io/blog/annotation-guidelines-practices/).


```python
annotator_guidelines = """\
Your task is to evaluate the responses of two LLMs to code generation tasks. 

First, you need to score each response on a scale from 0 to 7. You add points to your final score based on the following criteria:
- Add up to +2 points, if the code is properly commented, with inline comments and doc strings for functions.
- Add up to +2 points, if the code contains a good example for testing. 
- Add up to +3 points, if the code runs and works correctly. Copy the code into an IDE and test it with at least two different inputs. Attribute one point if the code is overall correct, but has some issues. Attribute three points if the code is fully correct and robust against different scenarios. 
Your resulting final score can be any value between 0 to 7. 

If both responses have a final score of <= 4, select one response and correct it manually in the text field. 
The corrected response must fulfill all criteria from above. 
"""

rating_tooltip = """\
- Add up to +2 points, if the code is properly commented, with inline comments and doc strings for functions.
- Add up to +2 points, if the code contains a good example for testing. 
- Add up to +3 points, if the code runs and works correctly. Copy the code into an IDE and test it with at least two different inputs. Attribute one point if the code works mostly correctly, but has some issues. Attribute three points if the code is fully correct and robust against different scenarios. 
"""
```

**Cumulative ratings vs. Likert scales:** Note that the guidelines above ask the annotators to do cumulative ratings by adding points for explicit criteria. An alternative approach are "Likert scales", where annotators are asked to rate responses on a continuous scale e.g. from 1 (very bad) to 3 (mediocre) to 5 (very good). We generally recommend cumulative ratings, because they force you and the annotators to make quality criteria explicit, while just rating a response as "4" (good) is ambiguous and will be interpreted differently by different annotators. 

#### Tailor your Argilla dataset to your specific task

We can now create our own `code-llm` task with the fields, questions, and metadata required for annotation. For more information on configuring the Argilla dataset, see the [Argilla docs](https://docs.argilla.io/latest/how_to_guides/dataset/#create-a-dataset).



```python
dataset_argilla_name = "code-llm"
workspace_name = "argilla"
reuse_existing_dataset = False  # for easier iterative testing

# Configure your dataset settings
settings = rg.Settings(
    # The overall annotation guidelines, which human annotators can refer back to inside of the interface
    guidelines="my guidelines",
    fields=[
        rg.TextField(
            name="instruction", title="Instruction:", use_markdown=True, required=True
        ),
        rg.TextField(
            name="generation_1",
            title="Response model 1:",
            use_markdown=True,
            required=True,
        ),
        rg.TextField(
            name="generation_2",
            title="Response model 2:",
            use_markdown=True,
            required=True,
        ),
    ],
    # These are the questions we ask annotators about the fields in the dataset
    questions=[
        rg.RatingQuestion(
            name="score_response_1",
            title="Your score for the response of model 1:",
            description="0=very bad, 7=very good",
            values=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],
            required=True,
        ),
        rg.RatingQuestion(
            name="score_response_2",
            title="Your score for the response of model 2:",
            description="0=very bad, 7=very good",
            values=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],
            required=True,
        ),
        rg.LabelQuestion(
            name="which_response_corrected",
            title="If both responses score below 4, select a response to correct:",
            description="Select the response you will correct in the text field below.",
            labels=["Response 1", "Response 2", "Combination of both", "Neither"],
            required=False,
        ),
        rg.TextQuestion(
            name="correction",
            title="Paste the selected response below and correct it manually:",
            description="Your corrected response must fulfill all criteria from the annotation guidelines.",
            use_markdown=True,
            required=False,
        ),
        rg.TextQuestion(
            name="comments",
            title="Annotator Comments",
            description="Add any additional comments here. E.g.: edge cases, issues with the interface etc.",
            use_markdown=True,
            required=False,
        ),
    ],
    metadata=[
        rg.TermsMetadataProperty(
            name="source-dataset",
            title="Original dataset source",
        ),
    ],
    allow_extra_metadata=False,
)

if reuse_existing_dataset:
    dataset_argilla = client.datasets(dataset_argilla_name, workspace=workspace_name)
else:
    dataset_argilla = rg.Dataset(
        name=dataset_argilla_name,
        settings=settings,
        workspace=workspace_name,
    )
    if client.datasets(dataset_argilla_name, workspace=workspace_name) is not None:
        client.datasets(dataset_argilla_name, workspace=workspace_name).delete()
    dataset_argilla = dataset_argilla.create()

dataset_argilla
```

After running the code above, you will see the new custom `code-llm` dataset in Argilla (and any other dataset you might have created before).



#### Load the data to Argilla

At this point, the dataset is still empty. Let's load some data with the code below.


```python
# Iterate over the samples in the dataset
records = [
    rg.Record(
        fields={
            "instruction": example["instructions"],
            "generation_1": example["response_model_1"],
            "generation_2": example["response_model_2"],
        },
        metadata={
            "source-dataset": "bigcode/self-oss-instruct-sc2-exec-filter-50k",
        },
        # Optional: add suggestions from an LLM-as-a-judge system
        # They will be indicated with a sparkle icon and shown as pre-filled responses
        # It will speed up manual annotation
        # suggestions=[
        #     rg.Suggestion(
        #         question_name="score_response_1",
        #         value=example["llm_judge_rating"],
        #         agent="llama-3-70b-instruct",
        #     ),
        # ],
    )
    for example in dataset
]

try:
    dataset_argilla.records.log(records)
except Exception as e:
    print("Exception:", e)
```

**The Argilla UI for annotation** will look similar to this:

![Argilla UI](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/cookbook-images/resolve/main/argilla-code-llm.png)

## Annotate

That's it, we've created our Argilla dataset and we can now start annotating in the UI! By default, the records will be completed when they have 1 annotation. Check these guides, to know how to [automatically distribute the annotation task](https://docs.argilla.io/latest/how_to_guides/distribution/) and [annotate in Argilla](https://docs.argilla.io/latest/how_to_guides/annotate/).


**Important**: If you use Argilla in a HF Space, you'd to activate persistent storage so that your data is safely stored and not automatically deleted after a while. For production settings, make sure that persistent storage is activated **before** making any annotations to avoid data loss.   

## Download annotated data
After annotating, you can pull the data from Argilla and simply store and process them locally in any tabular format (see [docs here](https://docs.argilla.io/latest/how_to_guides/import_export/)). You can also download the filtered version of the dataset ([docs](https://docs.argilla.io/latest/how_to_guides/query/)).


```python
annotated_dataset = client.datasets(dataset_argilla_name, workspace=workspace_name)

hf_dataset = annotated_dataset.records.to_datasets()

# This HF dataset can then be formatted, stored and processed into any tabular data format
hf_dataset.to_pandas()
```


```python
# Store the dataset locally
hf_dataset.to_csv("argilla-dataset-local.csv")  # Save as CSV
#hf_dataset.to_json("argilla-dataset-local.json")  # Save as JSON
#hf_dataset.save_to_disk("argilla-dataset-local")  # Save as a `datasets.Dataset` in the local filesystem
#hf_dataset.to_parquet()  # Save as Parquet
```

## Next Steps

That's it! You've created synthetic LLM data with the HF inference API, created a dataset in Argilla, uploaded the LLM data into Argilla, evaluated/corrected the data, and after annotation you have downloaded the data in a simple tabular format for downstream use. 

We have specifically designed the pipeline and the interface for **two main use-cases**: 
1. Evaluation: You can now simply use the numeric scores in the `score_response_1` and `score_response_2` columns to calculate which model was better overall. You can also inspect responses with very low or high ratings for a detailed error analysis. As you test or train different models, you can reuse this pipeline and track improvements of different models over time. 
2. Training: After annotating enough data, you can create a train-test split from the data and fine-tune your own model. You can either use highly rated response texts for supervised fine-tuning with the the [TRL SFTTrainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/en/sft_trainer), or you can directly use the ratings for preference-tuning techniques like DPO with the [TRL DPOTrainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/en/dpo_trainer). See the [TRL docs](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/en/index) for the pros and cons of different LLM fine-tuning techniques. 

**Adapt and improve:** Many things can be improved to tailor this pipeline to your specific use-cases. For example, you can prompt an LLM to evaluate the outputs of the two LLMs with instructions very similar to the guidelines for human annotators ("LLM-as-a-judge" approach). This can help further speed up your evaluation pipeline. See our [LLM-as-a-judge recipe](https://huggingface.co/learn/cookbook/llm_judge) for an example implementation of LLM-as-a-judge and our overall [Open-Source AI Cookbook](https://huggingface.co/learn/cookbook/index) for many other ideas.

# Creating Demos with Spaces and Gradio
_Authored by: [Diego Maniloff](https://huggingface.co/dmaniloff)_

## Introduction
In this notebook we will demonstrate how to bring any machine learning model to life using [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/), a library that allows you to create a web demo from any Python function and share it with the world 🌎!

📚 This notebook covers:
- Building a `Hello, World!` demo: The basics of Gradio
- Moving your demo to Hugging Face Spaces
- Making it interesting: a real-world example that leverages the 🤗 Hub
- Some of the cool "batteries included" features that come with Gradio

⏭️ At the end of this notebook you will find a `Further Reading` list with links to keep going on your own.

## Setup
To get started install the `gradio` library along with `transformers`.


```python
!pip -q install gradio==4.36.1
!pip -q install transformers==4.41.2
```


```python
# the usual shorthand is to import gradio as gr
import gradio as gr
```

## Your first demo: the basics of Gradio
At its core, Gradio turns any Python function into a web interface.

Say we have a simple function that takes `name` and `intensity` as parameters, and returns a string like so:



```python
def greet(name: str, intensity: int) -> str:
    return "Hello, " + name + "!" * int(intensity)
```

If you run this function for the name 'Diego' you will get an output string that looks like this:



```python
print(greet("Diego", 3))
```

    Hello, Diego!!!
    

With Gradio, we can build an interface for this function via the `gr.Interface` class. All we need to do is pass in the `greet` function we created above, and the kinds of inputs and outputs that our function expects:



```python
demo = gr.Interface(
    fn=greet,
    inputs=["text", "slider"], # the inputs are a text box and a slider ("text" and "slider" are components in Gradio)
    outputs=["text"],          # the output is a text box
)
```

Notice how we passed in `["text", "slider"]` as inputs and `["text"]` as outputs -- these are called [Components](https://www.gradio.app/docs/gradio/introduction) in Gradio.

That's all we need for our first demo. Go ahead and try it out 👇🏼! Type your name into the `name` textbox, slide the intensity that you want, and click `Submit`.


```python
# the launch method will fire up the interface we just created
demo.launch()
```

## Let's make it interesting: a meeting transcription tool
At this point you understand how to take a basic Python function and turn it into
a web-ready demo. However, we only did this for a function that is very simple, a bit boring even!

Let's consider a more interesting example that highlights the very thing that Gradio was built for: demoing cutting-edge machine learning models. A good friend of mine recently asked me for help with an audio recording of an interview she had done. She needed to convert the audio file into a well-organized text summary. How did I help her? I built a Gradio app!

Let's walk through the steps to build the meeting transcription tool. We can think of the process as two parts:


1. Transcribe the audio file into text
2. Organize the text into sections, paragraphs, lists, etc. We could include summarization here too.



### Audio-to-text
In this part we will build a demo that handles the first step of the meeting transcription tool: converting audio into text.

As we learned, the key ingredient to building a Gradio demo is to have a Python function that executes the logic we are trying to showcase. For the audio-to-text conversion, we will build our function using the awesome `transformers` library and its `pipeline` utility to use a popular audio-to-text model called `distil-whisper/distil-large-v3`.

The result is the following `transcribe` function, which takes as input the audio that we want to convert:




```python
import os
import tempfile

import torch
import gradio as gr
from transformers import pipeline

device = 0 if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"

AUDIO_MODEL_NAME = "distil-whisper/distil-large-v3" # faster and very close in performance to the full-size "openai/whisper-large-v3"
BATCH_SIZE = 8


pipe = pipeline(
    task="automatic-speech-recognition",
    model=AUDIO_MODEL_NAME,
    chunk_length_s=30,
    device=device,
)


def transcribe(audio_input):
    """Function to convert audio to text."""
    if audio_input is None:
        raise gr.Error("No audio file submitted!")

    output = pipe(
        audio_input,
        batch_size=BATCH_SIZE,
        generate_kwargs={"task": "transcribe"},
        return_timestamps=True
    )
    return output["text"]
```

Now that we have our Python function, we can demo that by passing it into `gr.Interface`. Notice how in this case the input that the function expects is the audio that we want to convert. Gradio includes a ton useful components, one of which is [Audio](https://www.gradio.app/docs/gradio/audio), exactly what we need for our demo 🎶 😎.



```python
part_1_demo = gr.Interface(
    fn=transcribe,
    inputs=gr.Audio(type="filepath"), # "filepath" passes a str path to a temporary file containing the audio
    outputs=gr.Textbox(show_copy_button=True), # give users the option to copy the results
    title="Transcribe Audio to Text", # give our demo a title :)
)

part_1_demo.launch()
```

Go ahead and try it out 👆! You can upload an `.mp3` file or hit the 🎤 button to record your own voice.

For a sample file with an actual meeting recording, you can check out the [MeetingBank_Audio dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huuuyeah/MeetingBank_Audio) which is a dataset of meetings from city councils of 6 major U.S. cities. For my own testing, I tried out a couple of the [Denver meetings](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huuuyeah/MeetingBank_Audio/blob/main/Denver/mp3/Denver-21.zip).

> [!TIP]
> Also check out `Interface`'s [from_pipeline](https://www.gradio.app/docs/gradio/interface#interface-from_pipeline) constructor which will directly build the `Interface` from a `pipeline`.

### Organize & summarize text
For part 2 of the meeting transcription tool, we need to organize the transcribed text from the previous step.

Once again, to build a Gradio demo we need the Python function with the logic that we care about. For text organization and summarization, we will use an "instruction-tuned" model that is trained to follow a broad range of tasks. There are many options to pick from such as [meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct) or [mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3). For our example we are going to use [microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct).


Just like for part 1, we could leverage the `pipeline` utility within `transformers` to do this, but instead we will take this opportunity to showcase the [Serverless Inference API](https://huggingface.co/docs/api-inference/index), which is an API within the Hugging Face Hub that allows us to use thousands of publicly accessible (or your own privately permissioned) machine learning models ***for free***! Check out the cookbook section of the Serverless Inferfence API [here](https://huggingface.co/learn/cookbook/en/enterprise_hub_serverless_inference_api).



Using the Serverless Inferfence API means that instead of calling a model via a pipeline (like we did for the audio conversion part), we will call it from the `InferenceClient`, which is part of the `huggingface_hub` library ([Hub Python Library](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/en/package_reference/login)). And in turn, to use the `InferenceClient`, we need to log into the 🤗 Hub using `notebook_login()`, which will produce a dialog box asking for your User Access Token to authenticate with the Hub.

You can manage your tokens from your [personal settings page](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens), and please remember to use [fine-grained](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security-tokens) tokens as much as possible for enhanced security.


```python
from huggingface_hub import notebook_login, InferenceClient

# running this will prompt you to enter your Hugging Face credentials
notebook_login()
```

Now that we are logged into the Hub, we can write our text processing function using the Serverless Inference API via `InferenceClient`.

The code for this part will be structured into two functions:

- `build_messages`, to format the message prompt into the LLM;
- `organize_text`, to actually pass the raw meeting text into the LLM for organization (and summarization, depending on the prompt we provide).



```python
# sample meeting transcript from huuuyeah/MeetingBank_Audio
# this is just a copy-paste from the output of part 1 using one of the Denver meetings
sample_transcript = """
 Good evening. Welcome to the Denver City Council meeting of Monday, May 8, 2017. My name is Kelly Velez. I'm your Council Secretary. According to our rules of procedure, when our Council President, Albus Brooks, and Council President Pro Tem, JoLynn Clark, are both absent, the Council Secretary calls the meeting to order. Please rise and join Councilman Herndon in the Pledge of Allegiance. Madam Secretary, roll call. Roll call. Here. Mark. Espinosa. Here. Platt. Delmar. Here. Here. Here. Here. We have five members present. There is not a quorum this evening. Many of the council members are participating in an urban exploration trip in Portland, Oregon, pursuant to Section 3.3.4 of the city charter. Because there is not a quorum of seven council members present, all of tonight's business will move to next week, to Monday, May 15th. Seeing no other business before this body except to wish Councilwoman Keniche a very happy birthday this meeting is adjourned Thank you. A standard model and an energy efficient model likely will be returned to you in energy savings many times during its lifespan. Now, what size do you need? Air conditioners are not a one-size-or-type fits all. Before you buy an air conditioner, you need to consider the size of your home and the cost to operate the unit per hour. Do you want a room air conditioner, which costs less but cools a smaller area, or do you want a central air conditioner, which cools your entire house but costs more? Do your homework. Now, let's discuss evaporative coolers. In low humidity areas, evaporating water into the air provides a natural and energy efficient means of cooling. Evaporative coolers, also called swamp coolers, cool outdoor air by passing it over water saturated pads, causing the water to evaporate into it. Evaporative coolers cost about one half as much to install as central air conditioners and use about one-quarter as much energy. However, they require more frequent maintenance than refrigerated air conditioners, and they're suitable only for areas with low humidity. Watch the maintenance tips at the end of this segment to learn more. And finally, fans. When air moves around in your home, it creates a wind chill effect. A mere two-mile-an-hour breeze will make your home feel four degrees cooler and therefore you can set your thermostat a bit higher. Ceiling fans and portable oscillating fans are cheap to run and they make your house feel cooler. You can also install a whole house fan to draw the hot air out of your home. A whole house fan draws cool outdoor air inside through open windows and exhausts hot room air through the attic to the outside. The result is excellent ventilation, lower indoor temperatures, and improved evaporative cooling. But remember, there are many low-cost, no-cost ways that you can keep your home cool. You should focus on these long before you turn on your AC or even before you purchase an AC. But if you are going to purchase a new cooling system, remember to get one that's energy efficient and the correct size for your home. Wait, wait, don't go away, there's more. After this segment of the presentation is over, you're going to be given the option to view maintenance tips about air conditioners and evaporative coolers. Now all of these tips are brought to you by the people at Xcel Energy. Thanks for watching.

```


```python
from huggingface_hub import InferenceClient

TEXT_MODEL_NAME = "microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct"

client = InferenceClient()

def organize_text(meeting_transcript):
    messages = build_messages(meeting_transcript)
    response = client.chat_completion(
        messages, model=TEXT_MODEL_NAME, max_tokens=250, seed=430
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content


def build_messages(meeting_transcript) -> list:
    system_input = "You are an assitant that organizes meeting minutes."
    user_input = """Take this raw meeting transcript and return an organized version.
    Here is the transcript:
    {meeting_transcript}
    """.format(meeting_transcript=meeting_transcript)

    messages = [
        {"role": "system", "content": system_input},
        {"role": "user", "content": user_input},
    ]
    return messages



```

And now that we have our text organization function `organize_text`, we can build a demo for it as well:


```python
part_2_demo = gr.Interface(
    fn=organize_text,
    inputs=gr.Textbox(value=sample_transcript),
    outputs=gr.Textbox(show_copy_button=True),
    title="Clean Up Transcript Text",
)
part_2_demo.launch()
```

Go ahead and try it out 👆! If you hit "Submit" in the demo above, you will see that the output text is a much clearer and organized version of the transcript, with a title and sections for the different parts of the meeting.

See if you can get a summary by playing around with the `user_input` variable that controls the LLM prompt.

### Putting it all together
At this point we have a function for each of the two steps we want out meeting transcription tool to do: 
1. convert the audio into a text file, and 
2. organize that text file into a nicely-formatted meeting document.

All we have to do next is stitch these two functions together and build a demo for the combined steps. In other words, our complete meeting transcription tool is just a new function (which we'll creatively call `meeting_transcript_tool` 😀) that takes the output of `transcribe` and passes it into `organize_text`:



```python
def meeting_transcript_tool(audio_input):
    meeting_text = transcribe(audio_input)
    organized_text = organize_text(meeting_text)
    return organized_text


full_demo = gr.Interface(
    fn=meeting_transcript_tool,
    inputs=gr.Audio(type="filepath"),
    outputs=gr.Textbox(show_copy_button=True),
    title="The Complete Meeting Transcription Tool",
)
full_demo.launch()

```

Go ahead and try it out 👆! This is now the full demo of our transcript tool. If you give it an audio file, the output will be the already-organized (and potentially summarized) version of the meeting. Super cool 😎.

## Move your demo into 🤗 Spaces
If you made it this far, now you know the basics of how to create a demo of your machine learning model using Gradio 👏!

Up next we are going to show you how to take your brand new demo to Hugging Face Spaces. On top of the ease of use and powerful features of Gradio, moving your demo to 🤗 Spaces gives you the benefit of permanent hosting, ease of deployment each time you update your app, and the ability to share your work with anyone! Do keep in mind that your Space will go to sleep after a while unless you are using it or making changes to it.


The first step is to head over to [https://huggingface.co/new-space](https://huggingface.co/new-space), select "Gradio" from the templates, and leave the rest of the options as default for now (you can change these later):

<img src="https://github.com/dmaniloff/public-screenshots/blob/main/create-new-space.png?raw=true" width="350" alt="image description">

This will result in a newly created Space that you can populate with your demo code. As an example for you to follow, I created the 🤗 Space `dmaniloff/meeting-transcript-tool`, which you can access [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/dmaniloff/meeting-transcript-tool).

There are two files we need to edit:

*   `app.py` -- This is where the demo code lives. It should look something like this:
      ```python
      # outline of app.py:

      def meeting_transcript_tool(...):
         ...

      def transcribe(...):
         ...

      def organize_text(...):
         ...

      ```

*   `requirements.txt` -- This is where we tell our Space about the libraries it will need. It should look something like this:
      ```
      # contents of requirements.txt:
      torch
      transformers
      ```


## Gradio comes with batteries included 🔋

Gradio comes with lots of cool functionality right out of the box. We won't be able to cover all of it in this notebook, but here's 3 that we will check out:

- Access as an API
- Sharing via public URL
- Flagging



### Access as an API
One of the benefits of building your web demos with Gradio is that you automatically get an API 🙌! This means that you can access the functionality of your Python function using a standard HTTP client like `curl` or the Python `requests` library.

If you look closely at the demos we created above, you will see at the bottom there is a link that says "Use via API". If you click on it in the Space I created ([dmaniloff/meeting-transcript-tool](https://huggingface.co/spaces/dmaniloff/meeting-transcript-tool/blob/main/app.py)), you will see the following:

<img src="https://github.com/dmaniloff/public-screenshots/blob/main/gradio-as-api.png?raw=true" width="750" alt="image description">

Let's go ahead and copy-paste that code below to use our Space as an API:


```python
!pip install gradio_client
```


```python
from gradio_client import Client, handle_file

client = Client("dmaniloff/meeting-transcript-tool")
result = client.predict(
		audio_input=handle_file('https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/raw/main/test/test_files/audio_sample.wav'),
		api_name="/predict"
)
print(result)
```

    Loaded as API: https://dmaniloff-meeting-transcript-tool.hf.space ✔
    Certainly! Below is an organized version of a hypothetical meeting transcript. Since the original transcript you've provided is quite minimal, I'll create a more detailed and structured example featuring a meeting summary.

    # Meeting Transcript: Project Alpha Kickoff
    
    **Date:** April 7, 2023
    
    **Location:** Conference Room B, TechCorp Headquarters
    
    
    **Attendees:**
    
    - John Smith (Project Manager)
    
    - Emily Johnson (Lead Developer)
    
    - Michael Brown (Marketing Lead)
    
    - Lisa Green (Design Lead)
    
    
    **Meeting Duration:** 1 hour 30 minutes
    
    
    ## Opening Remarks
    
    **John Smith:**
    
    Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining this kickoff meeting for Project Alpha. Today, we'll discuss our project vision, milestones, and roles. Let's get started.
    
    
    ## Vision and Goals
    
    **Emily Johnson:**
    
    The main goal of Project Alpha is to
    

Wow! What happened there? Let's break it down:

- We installed the `gradio_client`, which is a package that is specifically designed to interact with APIs built with Gradio.
- We instantiated the client by providing the name of the 🤗 Space that we want to query.
- We called the `predict` method of the client and passed in a sample audio file to it.

The Gradio client takes care of making the HTTP POST for us, and it also provides functionality like reading the input audio file that our meeting transcript tool will process (via the function `handle_file`).

Again, using this client is a choice, and you can just as well run a `curl -X POST https://dmaniloff-meeting-transcript-tool.hf.space/call/predict [...]` and pass in all the parameters needed in the request.

> [!TIP]
> The output that we get from the call above is a made-up meeting that was generated by the LLM that we are using for text organization. This is because the sample input file isn't an actual meeting recording. You can tweak the LLM's prompt to handle this case.

### Share via public URL
Another cool feature built into Gradio is that even if you build your demo on your local computer (before you move it into a 🤗 Space) you can still share this with anyone in the world by passing in `share=True` into `launch` like so:

```python
 demo.launch(share=True)
 ```

 You might have noticed that in this Google Colab environment that behaviour is enabled by default, and so the previous demos that we created already had a public URL that you can share 🌎. Go back ⬆ and look at the logs for `Running on public URL:` to find it 🔎!

### Flagging
[Flagging](https://www.gradio.app/guides/using-flagging) is a feature built into Gradio that allows the users of your demo to provide feedback. You might have noticed that the first demo we created had a `Flag` button at the bottom.

Under the default options, if a user clicks that button then the input and output samples are saved into a CSV log file that you can review later. If the demo involves audio (like in our case), these are saved separately in a parallel directory and the paths to these files are saved in the CSV file.

Go back and play with our first demo once more, and then click the `Flag` button. You will see that a new log file is created in the `flagged` directory:


```python
!cat flagged/log.csv
```

    name,intensity,output,flag,username,timestamp

    Diego,4,"Hello, Diego!!!!",,,2024-06-29 22:07:50.242707



In this case I set inputs to `name=diego` and `intensity=29`, which I then flagged. You can see that the log file includes the inputs to the function, the output `"Hello, diego!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"`, and also a timestamp.

While a list of inputs and outputs that your users found problematic is better than nothing, Gradio's flagging feature allows you to do much more. For example, you can provide a `flagging_options` parameter that lets you customize the kind of feedback or errors that you can receive, such as `["Incorrect", "Ambiguous"]`. Note that this requires that `allow_flagging` is set to `"manual"`:


```python
demo_with_custom_flagging = gr.Interface(
    fn=greet,
    inputs=["text", "slider"], # the inputs are a text box and a slider ("text" and "slider" are components in Gradio)
    outputs=["text"],          # the output is a text box
    allow_flagging="manual",
    flagging_options=["Incorrect", "Ambiguous"],
)
demo_with_custom_flagging.launch()
```

Go ahead and try it out 👆! You can see that the flagging buttons now are `Flag as Incorrect` and `Flag as Ambiguous`, and the new log file will reflect those options:


```python
!cat flagged/log.csv
```

    name,intensity,output,flag,username,timestamp

    Diego,4,"Hello, Diego!!!!",,,2024-06-29 22:07:50.242707

    Diego,5,"Hello, Diego!!!!!",Ambiguous,,2024-06-29 22:08:04.281030



## Wrap up & Next Steps
In this notebook we learned how to demo any machine learning model using Gradio.

First, we learned the basics of setting up an interface for a simple Python function; and second, we covered Gradio's true strength: building demos for machine learning models.

For this, we learned how easy it is to leverage models in the 🤗 Hub via the `transformers` library and its `pipeline` function, and how to use multimedia inputs like `gr.Audio`.

Third, we covered how to host your Gradio demo on 🤗 Spaces, which lets you keep your demo running in the cloud and gives you flexibility in terms of the compute requirements for your demo.

Finally, we showcased a few of the super cool batteries included that come with Gradio such as API access, public URLs, and Flagging.

# Inference Endpoints (dedicated) 
_Authored by: [Moritz Laurer](https://huggingface.co/MoritzLaurer)_

Have you ever wanted to create your own machine learning API? That's what we will do in this recipe with the [HF Dedicated Inference Endpoints](https://huggingface.co/docs/inference-endpoints/index). Inference Endpoints enable you to pick any of the hundreds of thousands of models on the HF Hub, create your own API on a deployment platform you control, and on hardware you choose.

[Serverless Inference APIs](link-to-recipe) are great for initial testing, but they are limited to a pre-configured selection of popular models and they are rate limited, because the serverless API's hardware is used by many users at the same time. With a Dedicated Inference Endpoint, you can customize the deployment of your model and the hardware is exclusively dedicated to you. 

In this recipe, we will: 
- Create an Inference Endpoint via a simple UI and send standard HTTP requests to the Endpoint
- Create and manage different Inference Endpoints programmatically with the `huggingface_hub` library
- Cover three use-cases: text generation with an LLM, image generation with Stable Diffusion, and reasoning over images with Idefics2. 

## Install and login
In case you don't have a HF Account, you can create your account [here](https://huggingface.co/join). If you work in a larger team, you can also create a [HF Organization](https://huggingface.co/organizations) and manage all your models, datasets and Endpoints via this organization. Dedicated Inference Endpoints are a paid service and you will therefore need to add a credit card to the [billing settings](https://huggingface.co/settings/billing) of your personal HF account, or of your HF organization.  

You can then create a user access token [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security-tokens). A token with `read` or `write` permissions will work for this guide, but we encourage the use of fine-grained tokens for increased security. For this notebook, you'll need a fine-grained token with `User Permissions > Inference > Make calls to Inference Endpoints & Manage Inference Endpoints` and `Repository permissions > google/gemma-1.1-2b-it & HuggingFaceM4/idefics2-8b-chatty`.


```python
!pip install huggingface_hub~=0.23.3
!pip install transformers~=4.41.2
```


```python
# Login to the HF Hub. We recommend using this login method 
# to avoid the need for explicitly storing your HF token in variables 
import huggingface_hub
huggingface_hub.interpreter_login()
```

## Creating your first Endpoint

With this initial setup out of the way, we can now create our first Endpoint. Navigate to https://ui.endpoints.huggingface.co/ and click on `+ New` next to `Dedicated Endpoints`. You will then see the interface for creating a new Endpoint with the following options (see image below):

- **Model Repository**: Here you can insert the identifier of any model on the HF Hub. For this initial demonstration, we use [google/gemma-1.1-2b-it](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-1.1-2b-it), a small generative LLM (2.5B parameters). 
- **Endpoint Name**: The Endpoint Name is automatically generated based on the model identifier, but you are free to change the name. Valid Endpoint names must only contain lower-case characters, numbers or hyphens ("-") and are between 4 to 32 characters long.
- **Instance Configuration**: Here you can choose from a wide range of CPUs or GPUs from all major cloud platforms. You can also adjust the region, for example if you need to host your Endpoint in the EU. 
- **Automatic Scale-to-Zero**: You can configure your Endpoint to scale to zero GPUs/CPUs after a certain amount of time. Scaled-to-zero Endpoints are not billed anymore. Note that restarting the Endpoint requires the model to be re-loaded into memory (and potentially re-downloaded), which can take several minutes for large models. 
- **Endpoint Security Level**: The standard security level is `Protected`, which requires an authorized HF token for accessing the Endpoint. `Public` Endpoints are accessible by anyone without token authentification. `Private` Endpoints are only available through an intra-region secured AWS or Azure PrivateLink connection.
- **Advanced configuration**: Here you can select some advanced options like the Docker container type. As Gemma is compatible with [Text Generation Inference (TGI)](https://huggingface.co/docs/text-generation-inference/index) containers, the system automatically selects TGI as the container type and other good default values.

For this guide, select the options in the image below and click on `Create Endpoint`. 


<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center !important;">
    <img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/cookbook-images/resolve/main/enterprise-endpoints-creation.png">  
</div>

After roughly one minute, your Endpoint will be created and you will see a page similar to the image below. 

On the Endpoint's `Overview` page, will find the URL for querying the Endpoint, a Playground for testing the model and additional tabs on `Analytics`, `Usage & Cost`, `Logs`and `Settings`.  

<div style="flex justify-center">

### Creating and managing Endpoints programmatically

When moving into production, you don't always want to manually start, stop and modify your Endpoints. The `huggingface_hub` library provides good functionality for managing your Endpoints programmatically. See the docs [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/guides/inference_endpoints) and details on all functions [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/en/package_reference/inference_endpoints). Here are some key functions:



```python
# list all your inference endpoints
huggingface_hub.list_inference_endpoints()

# get an existing endpoint and check it's status
endpoint = huggingface_hub.get_inference_endpoint(
    name="gemma-1-1-2b-it-yci",  # the name of the endpoint 
    namespace="MoritzLaurer"  # your user name or organization name
)
print(endpoint)

# Pause endpoint to stop billing
endpoint.pause()

# Resume and wait until the endpoint is ready
#endpoint.resume()
#endpoint.wait()

# Update the endpoint to a different GPU
# You can find the correct arguments for different hardware types in this table: https://huggingface.co/docs/inference-endpoints/pricing#gpu-instances
#endpoint.update(
#    instance_size="x1",
#    instance_type="nvidia-a100",  # nvidia-a10g
#)
```

You can also create an inference Endpoint programmatically. Let's recreate the same `gemma` LLM Endpoint as the one created with the UI.


```python
from huggingface_hub import create_inference_endpoint


model_id = "google/gemma-1.1-2b-it"
endpoint_name = "gemma-1-1-2b-it-001"  # Valid Endpoint names must only contain lower-case characters, numbers or hyphens ("-") and are between 4 to 32 characters long.
namespace = "MoritzLaurer"  # your user or organization name


# check if endpoint with this name already exists from previous tests
available_endpoints_names = [endpoint.name for endpoint in huggingface_hub.list_inference_endpoints()]
if endpoint_name in available_endpoints_names:
    endpoint_exists = True
else: 
    endpoint_exists = False
print("Does the endpoint already exist?", endpoint_exists)
    

# create new endpoint
if not endpoint_exists:
    endpoint = create_inference_endpoint(
        endpoint_name,
        repository=model_id,
        namespace=namespace,
        framework="pytorch",
        task="text-generation",
        # see the available hardware options here: https://huggingface.co/docs/inference-endpoints/pricing#pricing
        accelerator="gpu",
        vendor="aws",
        region="us-east-1",
        instance_size="x1",
        instance_type="nvidia-a10g",
        min_replica=0,
        max_replica=1,
        type="protected",
        # since the LLM is compatible with TGI, we specify that we want to use the latest TGI image
        custom_image={
            "health_route": "/health",
            "env": {
                "MODEL_ID": "/repository"
            },
            "url": "ghcr.io/huggingface/text-generation-inference:latest",
        },
    )
    print("Waiting for endpoint to be created")
    endpoint.wait()
    print("Endpoint ready")

# if endpoint with this name already exists, get and resume existing endpoint
else:
    endpoint = huggingface_hub.get_inference_endpoint(name=endpoint_name, namespace=namespace)
    if endpoint.status in ["paused", "scaledToZero"]:
        print("Resuming endpoint")
        endpoint.resume()
    print("Waiting for endpoint to start")
    endpoint.wait()
    print("Endpoint ready")
```


```python
# access the endpoint url for API calls
print(endpoint.url)
```

## Querying your Endpoint

Now let's query this Endpoint like any other LLM API. First copy the Endpoint URL from the interface (or use `endpoint.url`) and assign it to `API_URL` below. We then use the standardised messages format for the text inputs, i.e. a dictionary of user and assistant messages, which you might know from other LLM API services. We then need to apply the chat template to the messages, which LLMs like Gemma, Llama-3 etc. have been trained to expect (see details on in the [docs](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/chat_templating)). For most recent generative LLMs, it is essential to apply this chat template, otherwise the model's performance will degrade without throwing an error. 


```python
import requests
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

# paste your endpoint URL here or reuse endpoint.url if you created the endpoint programmatically
API_URL = endpoint.url  # or paste link like "https://dz07884a53qjqb98.us-east-1.aws.endpoints.huggingface.cloud" 
HEADERS = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {huggingface_hub.get_token()}"}

# function for standard http requests
def query(payload=None, api_url=None):
    response = requests.post(api_url, headers=HEADERS, json=payload)
    return response.json()


# define conversation input in messages format
# you can also provide multiple turns between user and assistant
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Please write a short poem about open source for me."},
    #{"role": "assistant", "content": "I am not in the mood."},
    #{"role": "user", "content": "Can you please do this for me?"},
]

# apply the chat template for the respective model
model_id = "google/gemma-1.1-2b-it"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id) 
messages_with_template = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, tokenize=False)
print("Your text input looks like this, after the chat template has been applied:\n")
print(messages_with_template)
```

    Your text input looks like this, after the chat template has been applied:
    
    <bos><start_of_turn>user
    Please write a short poem about open source for me.<end_of_turn>
    
    


```python
# send standard http request to endpoint
output = query(
    payload = {
        "inputs": messages_with_template,
        "parameters": {"temperature": 0.2, "max_new_tokens": 100, "seed": 42, "return_full_text": False},
    },
    api_url = API_URL
)

print("The output from your API/Endpoint call:\n")
print(output)
```

    The output from your API/Endpoint call:
    
    [{'generated_text': "Free to use, free to share,\nA collaborative code, a community's care.\n\nCode transparent, bugs readily found,\nContributions welcome, stories unbound.\nOpen source, a gift to all,\nBuilding the future, one line at a call.\n\nSo join the movement, embrace the light,\nOpen source, shining ever so bright."}]
    

That's it, you've made the first request to your Endpoint - your very own API!

If you want the Endpoint to handle the chat template automatically and if your LLM runs on a TGI container, you can also use the [messages API](https://huggingface.co/docs/text-generation-inference/en/messages_api) by appending the `/v1/chat/completions` path to the URL. With the `/v1/chat/completions` path, the [TGI](https://huggingface.co/docs/text-generation-inference/index) container running on the Endpoint applies the chat template automatically and is fully compatible with OpenAI's API structure for easier interoperability. See the [TGI Swagger UI](https://huggingface.github.io/text-generation-inference/#/Text%20Generation%20Inference/chat_completions) for all available parameters. Note that the parameters accepted by the default `/` path and by the `/v1/chat/completions` path are slightly different. Here is the slightly modified code for using the messages API:


```python
API_URL_CHAT = API_URL + "/v1/chat/completions"

output = query(
    payload = {
        "messages": messages,
        "model": "tgi",
        "parameters": {"temperature": 0.2, "max_tokens": 100, "seed": 42},
    },
    api_url = API_URL_CHAT
)

### Simplified Endpoint usage with the InferenceClient

You can also use the [`InferenceClient`](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/en/package_reference/inference_client#huggingface_hub.InferenceClient) to easily send requests to your Endpoint. The client is a convenient utility available in the `huggingface_hub` Python library that allows you to easily make calls to both [Dedicated Inference Endpoints](https://huggingface.co/docs/inference-endpoints/index) and the [Serverless Inference API](https://huggingface.co/docs/api-inference/index). See the [docs](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/en/package_reference/inference_client#inference) for details. 

This is the most succinct way of sending requests to your Endpoint:


```python
from huggingface_hub import InferenceClient

client = InferenceClient()

output = client.chat_completion(
    messages,  # the chat template is applied automatically, if your endpoint uses a TGI container
    model=API_URL, 
    temperature=0.2, max_tokens=100, seed=42,
)

print("The output from your API/Endpoint call with the InferenceClient:\n")
print(output)
```


```python
# pause the endpoint to stop billing
#endpoint.pause()
```

## Creating Endpoints for a wide variety of models
Following the same process, you can create Endpoints for any of the models on the HF Hub. Let's illustrate some other use-cases.

### Image generation with Stable Diffusion
We can create an image generation Endpoint with almost the exact same code as for the LLM. The only difference is that we do not use the TGI container in this case, as TGI is only designed for LLMs (and vision LMs). 


```python
!pip install Pillow  # for image processing
```

# if endpoint with this name already exists, get existing endpoint

    if endpoint.status in ["paused", "scaledToZero"]:
        print("Resuming endpoint")
        endpoint.resume()
    print("Waiting for endpoint to start")
    endpoint.wait()
    print("Endpoint ready")

    
```

    Does the endpoint already exist? True
    Waiting for endpoint to start
    Endpoint ready
    


```python
prompt = "A whimsical illustration of a fashionably dressed llama proudly holding a worn, vintage cookbook, with a warm cup of tea and a few freshly baked treats scattered around, set against a cozy background of rustic wood and blooming flowers."

image = client.text_to_image(
    prompt=prompt,
    model=endpoint.url,  #"stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0",
    guidance_scale=8,

```

![png](output_25_1.png)
    


We pause the Endpoint again to stop billing. 


```python
endpoint.pause()
```

### Vision Language Models: Reasoning over text and images

Now let's create an Endpoint for a vision language model (VLM). VLMs are very similar to LLMs, only that they can take both text and images as input simultaneously. Their output is autoregressively generated text, just like for a standard LLM. VLMs can tackle many tasks from visual question answering to document understanding. For this example, we use [Idefics2](https://huggingface.co/blog/idefics2), a powerful 8B parameter VLM. 

We first need to convert our PIL image generated with Stable Diffusion to a `base64` encoded string so that we can send it to the model over the network.


```python
import base64
from io import BytesIO


def pil_image_to_base64(image):
    buffered = BytesIO()
    image.save(buffered, format="JPEG")
    img_str = base64.b64encode(buffered.getvalue()).decode("utf-8")
    return img_str


image_b64 = pil_image_to_base64(image)
```

Because VLMs and LLMs are so similar, we can use almost the same messages format and chat template again, only with some additional code for including the image in the prompt. See the [Idefics2 model card](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceM4/idefics2-8b) for specific details on prompt formatting. 


```python
from transformers import AutoProcessor

# load the processor
model_id_vlm = "HuggingFaceM4/idefics2-8b-chatty"
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id_vlm)

# define the user messages
messages = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {"type": "image"},  # the image is placed here in the prompt. You can add multiple images throughout the conversation.
            {"type": "text", "text": "Write a short limerick about this image."},
        ],
    },
]

# apply the chat template to the messages
prompt = processor.apply_chat_template(messages, add_generation_prompt=True)

# the chat template places a special "<image>" token at the position where the image should go
# here we replace the "<image>" token with the base64 encoded image string in the prompt
# to be able to send the image via an API request
image_input = f"data:image/jpeg;base64,{image_b64}"
image_input = f"![]({image_input})"
prompt = prompt.replace("<image>", image_input)
```

> [!TIP]
> For VLMs, an image represents a certain amount of tokens. For Idefics2, for example, one image represents 64 tokens at low resolution and 5*64=320 tokens in high resolution. High resolution is the default in TGI (see `do_image_splitting` in the [model card](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceM4/idefics2-8b-chatty) for details). This means that one image consumed 320 tokens. 

Several VLMs like Idefics2 are also supported by TGI (see [list of supported models](https://huggingface.co/docs/text-generation-inference/supported_models)), so we use the TGI container again when creating the Endpoint. 



```python
from huggingface_hub import create_inference_endpoint

endpoint_name = "idefics2-8b-chatty-001"
namespace = "MoritzLaurer"
task = "text-generation"

# check if endpoint with this name already exists from previous tests
available_endpoints_names = [endpoint.name for endpoint in huggingface_hub.list_inference_endpoints()]
if endpoint_name in available_endpoints_names:
    endpoint_exists = True
else: 
    endpoint_exists = False
print("Does the endpoint already exist?", endpoint_exists)
    

if endpoint_exists:
    endpoint = huggingface_hub.get_inference_endpoint(name=endpoint_name, namespace=namespace)
    if endpoint.status in ["paused", "scaledToZero"]:
        print("Resuming endpoint")
        endpoint.resume()
    print("Waiting for endpoint to start")
    endpoint.wait()
    print("Endpoint ready")

else:
    endpoint = create_inference_endpoint(
        endpoint_name,
        repository=model_id_vlm,
        namespace=namespace,
        framework="pytorch",
        task=task,
        accelerator="gpu",
        vendor="aws",
        region="us-east-1",
        type="protected",
        instance_size="x1",
        instance_type="nvidia-a100",
        min_replica=0,
        max_replica=1,
        custom_image={
            "health_route": "/health",
            "env": {
                "MAX_BATCH_PREFILL_TOKENS": "2048",
                "MAX_INPUT_LENGTH": "1024",
                "MAX_TOTAL_TOKENS": "1536",
                "MODEL_ID": "/repository"
            },
            "url": "ghcr.io/huggingface/text-generation-inference:latest",
        },
    )

    print("Waiting for endpoint to be created")
    endpoint.wait()
    print("Endpoint ready")
```

    Does the endpoint already exist? False
    Waiting for endpoint to be created
    Endpoint ready
    


```python
output = client.text_generation(
    prompt, model=model_id_vlm, max_new_tokens=200, seed=42
)

print(output)
```

     In a quaint little café, there lived a llama,
    With glasses on his face, he was quite a charm.
    He'd sit at the table,
    With a book and a mable,
    And sip from a cup of warm tea.
    


```python
endpoint.pause()
```

## Additional information
- When creating several Endpoints, you will probably get an error message that your GPU quota has been reached. Don't hesitate to send a message to the email address in the error message and we will most likely increase your GPU quota.
- What is the difference between `paused` and `scaled-to-zero` Endpoints? `scaled-to-zero` Endpoints can be flexibly woken up and scaled up by user requests, while `paused` Endpoints need to be unpaused by the creator of the Endpoint. Moreover, `scaled-to-zero` Endpoints count towards your GPU quota (with the maximum possible replica it could be scaled up to), while `paused` Endpoints do not. A simple way of freeing up your GPU quota is therefore to pause some Endpoints.  

## Conclusion and next steps

That's it, you've created three different Endpoints (your own APIs!) for text-to-text, text-to-image, and image-to-text generation and the same is possible for many other models and tasks. 

We encourage you to read the Dedicated Inference Endpoint [docs](https://huggingface.co/docs/inference-endpoints/index) to learn more. If you are using generative LLMs and VLMs, we also recommend reading the TGI [docs](https://huggingface.co/docs/text-generation-inference/index), as the most popular LLMs/VLMs are also supported by TGI, which makes your Endpoints significantly more efficient. 

You can, for example, use **JSON-mode or function calling** with open-source models via [TGI Guidance](https://huggingface.co/docs/text-generation-inference/basic_tutorials/using_guidance) (see also this [recipe](https://huggingface.co/learn/cookbook/structured_generation) for an example for RAG with structured generation). 

When moving your Endpoints into production, you will want to make several additional improvements to make your setup more efficient. When using TGI, you should send batches of requests to the Endpoint with asynchronous function calls to fully utilize the Endpoint's hardware and you can adapt several container parameters to optimize latency and throughput for your use-case. We will cover these optimizations in another recipe.

# Serverless Inference API
_Authored by: [Andrew Reed](https://huggingface.co/andrewrreed)_

Hugging Face provides a [Serverless Inference API](https://huggingface.co/docs/api-inference/index) as a way for users to quickly test and evaluate thousands of publicly accessible (or your own privately permissioned) machine learning models with simple API calls ***for free***!

In this notebook recipe, we'll demonstrate several different ways you can query the Serverless Inference API while exploring various tasks including: 
- generating text with open LLMs
- creating images with stable diffusion
- reasoning over images with VLMs
- generating speech from text

The goal is to help you get started by covering the basics!


> [!TIP]
> Because we offer the Serverless Inference API for free, there are rate limits for regular Hugging Face users (~ few hundred requests per hour). For access to higher rate limits, you can [upgrade to a PRO account](https://huggingface.co/subscribe/pro) for just $9 per month. However, for high-volume, production inference workloads, check out our [Dedicated Inference Endpoints](https://huggingface.co/docs/inference-endpoints/index) solution.


## Let's get started

To begin using the Serverless Inference API, you'll need a Hugging Face Hub profile: you can [register](https://huggingface.co/join) if you don't have one or [login here](https://huggingface.co/login) if you do. 

Next, you'll need to create a [User Access Token](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security-tokens). A token with `read` or `write` permissions will work. However, we highly encourage the use of fine-grained tokens. 

> [!TIP]
> For this notebook, you'll need a fine-grained token with `Inference > Make calls to the serverless Inference API` user permissions, along with read access to `meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct` and `HuggingFaceM4/idefics2-8b-chatty` repos as we must download their tokenizers to run this notebook. 

With those steps out of the way, we can install our required packages and authenticate to the Hub with our User Access Token.


```python
%pip install -U huggingface_hub transformers
```


```python
import os
from huggingface_hub import interpreter_login, whoami, get_token

# running this will prompt you to enter your Hugging Face credentials
interpreter_login()
```

> [!TIP]
> We've used the `interpreter_login()` above to programatically login to the Hub. As an alternative, we could also use other methods like `notebook_login()` from the [Hub Python Library](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/en/package_reference/login) or `login` command from the [Hugging Face CLI tool](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/en/guides/cli#huggingface-cli-login).

Now, lets verify we're properly logged in using `whoami()` to print out the active username and the organizations your profile belongs to.


```python
whoami()
```

## Querying the Serverless Inference API

The Serverless Inference API exposes models on the Hub with a simple API:

`https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/<MODEL_ID>`

where `<MODEL_ID>` corresponds to the name of the model repo on the Hub.

For example, [codellama/CodeLlama-7b-hf](https://huggingface.co/codellama/CodeLlama-7b-hf) becomes https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/codellama/CodeLlama-7b-hf

### With an HTTP request

We can easily call this API with a simple `POST` request via the `requests` library.


```python
import requests

API_URL = "https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/codellama/CodeLlama-7b-hf"
HEADERS = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {get_token()}"}


def query(payload):
    response = requests.post(API_URL, headers=HEADERS, json=payload)
    return response.json()


print(
    query(
        payload={
            "inputs": "A HTTP POST request is used to ",
            "parameters": {"temperature": 0.8, "max_new_tokens": 50, "seed": 42},
        }
    )
)
```

    [{'generated_text': 'A HTTP POST request is used to send data to a web server.\n\n# Example\n```javascript\npost("localhost:3000", {foo: "bar"})\n  .then(console.log => console.log(\'success\'))\n```\n\n'}]
    

Nice! The API responded with a continuation of our input prompt. But you might be wondering... how did the API know what to do with the payload? And how do I as a user know which parameters can be passed for a given model?

Behind the scenes, the inference API will dynamically load the requested model onto shared compute infrastructure to serve predictions. When the model is loaded, the Serverless Inference API will use the specified `pipeline_tag` from the Model Card (see [here](https://huggingface.co/codellama/CodeLlama-7b-hf/blob/main/README.md?code=true#L4)) to determine the appropriate inference task. You can reference the corresponding [task](https://huggingface.co/tasks) or [pipeline](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/main_classes/pipelines) documentation to find the allowed arguments.


> [!TIP]
> If the requested model is not already loaded into memory at the time of request (which is determined by recent requests for that model), the Serverless Inference API will initially return a 503 response, before it can successfully respond with the prediction. Try again after a few moments to allow the model time to spin up.
> You can also check to see which models are loaded and available at any given time using `InferenceClient().list_deployed_models()`.

### With the `huggingface_hub` Python library

To send your requests in Python, you can take advantage of the [`InferenceClient`](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/en/package_reference/inference_client#huggingface_hub.InferenceClient), a convenient utility available in the `huggingface_hub` Python library that allows you to easily make calls to the Serverless Inference API.


```python
from huggingface_hub import InferenceClient

client = InferenceClient()
response = client.text_generation(
    prompt="A HTTP POST request is used to ",
    model="codellama/CodeLlama-7b-hf",
    temperature=0.8,
    max_new_tokens=50,
    seed=42,
    return_full_text=True,
)
print(response)
```

    A HTTP POST request is used to send data to a web server.
    
    # Example
    ```javascript
    post("localhost:3000", {foo: "bar"})
      .then(console.log => console.log('success'))
    ```
    
    
    

Notice that with the `InferenceClient`, we specify just the model ID, and also pass arguments directly in the `text_generation()` method. We can easily inspect the function signature to see more details about how to use the task and its allowable parameters.


```python
# uncomment the following line to see the function signature
# help(client.text_generation)
```

> [!TIP]
> In addition to Python, you can also use JavaScript to integrate inference calls inside your JS or node apps. Take a look at [huggingface.js](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface.js/index) to get started.

## Applications

Now that we know how the Serverless Inference API works, let's take it for a spin and learn a few tricks along the way.

### 1. Generating Text with Open LLMs

Text generation is a very common use case. However, interacting with open LLMs has some subtleties that are important to understand to avoid silent performance degradation. When it comes to text generation, the underlying language model may come in a couple different flavors:
- **Base models:** refer to plain, pre-trained language models like [codellama/CodeLlama-7b-hf](https://huggingface.co/codellama/CodeLlama-7b-hf) or [meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B). These models are good at continuing generation from a provided prompt (like we saw in the example above). However, they have not been fine-tuned for conversational use like answering questions.
- **Instruction-tuned models:** are trained in a multi-task manner to follow a broad range of instructions like "Write me a recipe for chocolate cake". Models like [meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct) or [mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3) are trained in this manner. Instruction-tuned models will produce better responses to instructions than base models. Often, these models are also fine-tuned for multi-turn chat dialogs, making them great for conversational use cases.

These subtle differences are important to understand because they affect the way in which we should query a particular model. Instruct models are trained with [chat templates](https://huggingface.co/blog/chat-templates) that are specific to the model, so you need to be careful about the format the model expects and replicate it in your queries.

For example, [meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct) uses the following prompt structure to delineate between system, user, and assistant dialog turns:

```
<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>

{{ system_prompt }}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

{{ user_msg_1 }}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

{{ model_answer_1 }}<|eot_id|>
```

The special tokens, and prompt format vary model to model. To make sure we're using the correct format, we can rely on a model's [chat template](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/chat_templating) via it's tokenizer, as shown below.


```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

# define the system and user messages
system_input = "You are an expert prompt engineer with artistic flair."
user_input = "Write a concise prompt for a fun image containing a llama and a cookbook. Only return the prompt."
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": system_input},
    {"role": "user", "content": user_input},
]

# load the model and tokenizer
model_id = "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)

# apply the chat template to the messages
prompt = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    messages, tokenize=False, add_generation_prompt=True
)
print(f"\nPROMPT:\n-----\n\n{prompt}")
```

    Special tokens have been added in the vocabulary, make sure the associated word embeddings are fine-tuned or trained.
    

    
    PROMPT:
    -----
    
    <|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>
    
    You are an expert prompt engineer with artistic flair.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>
    
    Write a concise prompt for a fun image containing a llama and a cookbook. Only return the prompt.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
    
    
    

Notice how the `apply_chat_template()` method has taken the familiar list of messages and converted them into the properly formated string that our model expects. We can use this formatted string to pass to the Serverless Inference API's `text_generation` method.


```python
llm_response = client.text_generation(
    prompt, model=model_id, max_new_tokens=250, seed=42
)
print(llm_response)
```

    "A whimsical illustration of a llama proudly holding a cookbook, with a sassy expression and a sprinkle of flour on its nose, surrounded by a colorful kitchen backdrop with utensils and ingredients scattered about, as if the llama is about to whip up a culinary masterpiece."
    

Querying an LLM without adhering to the model's prompt template _will not_ produce any outright errors! However, it will result in poor quality outputs. Take a look at what happens when we pass the same system and user input, but **without** formatting it according to the chat template.


```python
out = client.text_generation(
    system_input + " " + user_input, model=model_id, max_new_tokens=250, seed=42
)
print(out)
```

The cookbook is titled "Llama's Favorite Recipes" and has a llama on the cover. The llama is surrounded by a warm, golden light, and the kitchen is filled with the aroma of freshly baked bread. The llama is smiling and looking directly at the viewer, as if inviting them to join in the cooking fun. The image should be colorful, whimsical, and full of texture and detail. The llama should be the main focus of the image, and the cookbook should be prominently displayed. The background should be a warm, earthy color, such as terracotta or sienna. The overall mood of the image should be playful, inviting, and joyful. 1 answer below »

Yikes! The LLM hallucinated a non-sensical intro, repeated the prompt unexpectedly, and failed to remain concise. To simplify the prompting process and ensure the proper chat template is being used, the `InferenceClient` also offers a `chat_completion` method that abstracts away the `chat_template` details. This allows you to simply pass a list of messages:


```python
for token in client.chat_completion(
    messages, model=model_id, max_tokens=250, stream=True, seed=42
):
    print(token.choices[0].delta.content)
```

#### Streaming 

In the example above, we've also set `stream=True` to enable streaming text from the endpoint. To learn about more functionality like this and about best practices when querying LLMs, we recommend reading more on these supporting resources:
1. [How to generate text: using different decoding methods for language generation with Transformers](https://huggingface.co/blog/how-to-generate)
2. [Text generation strategies](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/generation_strategies)
3. [Inference for PROs](https://huggingface.co/blog/inference-pro) - particularly the section on [controlling text generation](https://huggingface.co/blog/inference-pro#controlling-text-generation)
4. [Inference Client Docs](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/en/package_reference/inference_client#inference)


### 2. Creating Images with Stable Diffusion

The Serverless Inference API can be used for [many different tasks](https://huggingface.co/tasks). Here we'll use it to generate images with Stable Diffusion.


```python
image = client.text_to_image(
    prompt=llm_response,
    model="stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0",
    guidance_scale=8,
    seed=42,
)

display(image.resize((image.width // 2, image.height // 2)))
print("PROMPT: ", llm_response)
```


    
![png](output_29_0.png)
    


    PROMPT:  "A whimsical illustration of a llama proudly holding a cookbook, with a sassy expression and a sprinkle of flour on its nose, surrounded by a colorful kitchen backdrop with utensils and ingredients scattered about, as if the llama is about to whip up a culinary masterpiece."
    

#### Caching

The `InferenceClient` will cache API responses by default. That means if you query the API with the same payload multiple times, you’ll see that the result returned by the API is exactly the same. Take a look:




```python
image = client.text_to_image(
    prompt=llm_response,
    model="stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0",
    guidance_scale=8,
    seed=42,
)

display(image.resize((image.width // 2, image.height // 2)))
print("PROMPT: ", llm_response)
```


    
![png](output_31_0.png)
    


    PROMPT:  "A whimsical illustration of a llama proudly holding a cookbook, with a sassy expression and a sprinkle of flour on its nose, surrounded by a colorful kitchen backdrop with utensils and ingredients scattered about, as if the llama is about to whip up a culinary masterpiece."
    

To force a different response each time, we can use a HTTP header to have the client ignore the cache and run a new generation: `x-use-cache: 0`.


```python
# turn caching off
client.headers["x-use-cache"] = "0"

# generate a new image with the same prompt
image = client.text_to_image(
    prompt=llm_response,
    model="stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0",
    guidance_scale=8,
    seed=42,
)

display(image.resize((image.width // 2, image.height // 2)))
print("PROMPT: ", llm_response)
```


    
![png](output_33_0.png)
    


    PROMPT:  "A whimsical illustration of a llama proudly holding a cookbook, with a sassy expression and a sprinkle of flour on its nose, surrounded by a colorful kitchen backdrop with utensils and ingredients scattered about, as if the llama is about to whip up a culinary masterpiece."
    

### 3. Reasoning Over Images with Idefics2

Vision language models (VLMs) can take both text and images as input simultaneously and produce text as output. This allows them to tackle many tasks from visual question answering to image captioning. Let's use the Serverless Inference API to query [Idefics2](https://huggingface.co/blog/idefics2), a powerful 8B parameter VLM, and have it write us a poem about our newly generated image.

We first need to convert our PIL image to a `base64` encoded string so that we can send it to the model over the network.


```python
import base64
from io import BytesIO


def pil_image_to_base64(image):
    buffered = BytesIO()
    image.save(buffered, format="JPEG")
    img_str = base64.b64encode(buffered.getvalue()).decode("utf-8")
    return img_str


image_b64 = pil_image_to_base64(image)
```

Then, we need to properly format our text + image prompt using a chat template. See the [Idefics2 model card](https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceM4/idefics2-8b) for specific details on prompt formatting. 


```python
from transformers import AutoProcessor

# load the processor
vlm_model_id = "HuggingFaceM4/idefics2-8b-chatty"
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(vlm_model_id)

# define the user messages
messages = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {"type": "image"},
            {"type": "text", "text": "Write a short limerick about this image."},
        ],
    },
]

# apply the chat template to the messages
prompt = processor.apply_chat_template(messages, add_generation_prompt=True)

# add the base64 encoded image to the prompt
image_input = f"data:image/jpeg;base64,{image_b64}"
image_input = f"![]({image_input})"
prompt = prompt.replace("<image>", image_input)
```

    Special tokens have been added in the vocabulary, make sure the associated word embeddings are fine-tuned or trained.
    

And then finally call the Serverless API to get a prediction. In our case, a fun limerick about our generated image!


```python
limerick = client.text_generation(
    prompt, model=vlm_model_id, max_new_tokens=200, seed=42
)
print(limerick)
```

     In the heart of a kitchen, so bright and so clean,
    Lived a llama named Lulu, quite the culinary queen.
    With a book in her hand, she'd read and she'd cook,
    Her recipes were magic, her skills were so nook.
    In her world, there was no room for defeat,
    For Lulu, the kitchen was where she'd meet.
    

### 4. Generating Speech from Text

To finish up, let's use a transformers-based, text-to-audio model called [Bark](https://huggingface.co/suno/bark) to generate an audible voiceover for our poem.


```python
tts_model_id = "suno/bark"
speech_out = client.text_to_speech(text=limerick, model=tts_model_id)
```


```python
from IPython.display import Audio

display(Audio(speech_out, rate=24000))
print(limerick)
```

    In the heart of a kitchen, so bright and so clean,
    Lived a llama named Lulu, quite the culinary queen.
    With a book in her hand, she'd read and she'd cook,
    Her recipes were magic, her skills were so nook.
    In her world, there was no room for defeat,
    For Lulu, the kitchen was where she'd meet.
    

## Next Steps

Thats it! In this notebook, we learned how to use the Serverless Inference API to query a variety of powerful transformer models. We've just scratched the surface of what you can do, and recommend checking out [the docs](https://huggingface.co/docs/api-inference/en/index) to learn more about what's possible.

# Gemini API: Entity extraction

Use Gemini API to speed up some of your tasks, such as searching through text to extract needed information. Entity extraction with a Gemini model is a simple query, and you can ask it to retrieve its answer in the form that you prefer.

This notebook shows how to extract entities into a list.

<table class="tfo-notebook-buttons" align="left">
  <td>
    <a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/examples/Entity_Extraction.ipynb"><img src = "../images/colab_logo_32px.png"/>Run in Google Colab</a>
  </td>
</table>

## Setup


```
!pip install -U -q "google-generativeai>=0.7.2"
```


```
import google.generativeai as genai
from IPython.display import Markdown
```

## Configure your API key

To run the following cell, your API key must be stored it in a Colab Secret named `GOOGLE_API_KEY`. If you don't already have an API key, or you're not sure how to create a Colab Secret, see [Authentication](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Authentication.ipynb) for an example.


```
from google.colab import userdata
GOOGLE_API_KEY=userdata.get('GOOGLE_API_KEY')

genai.configure(api_key=GOOGLE_API_KEY)
```

# Examples

You will use Gemini 1.5 Flash model for fast responses.


```
model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash-latest')
```

### Extracting few entities at once

This block of text is about possible ways to travel from the airport to the Colosseum.  

Let's extract all street names and proposed forms of transportation from it.


```
directions = """To reach the Colosseum from Rome's Fiumicino Airport (FCO), your options are diverse.
Take the Leonardo Express train from FCO to Termini Station, then hop on metro line A towards Battistini and alight at Colosseo station.
Alternatively, hop on a direct bus, like the Terravision shuttle, from FCO to Termini, then walk a short distance to the Colosseum on Via dei Fori Imperiali.
If you prefer a taxi, simply hail one at the airport and ask to be taken to the Colosseum.
The taxi will likely take you through Via del Corso and Via dei Fori Imperiali.
A private transfer service offers a direct ride from FCO to the Colosseum, bypassing the hustle of public transport.
If you're feeling adventurous, consider taking the train from FCO to Ostiense station,
then walking through the charming Trastevere neighborhood, crossing Ponte Palatino to reach the Colosseum, passing by the Tiber River and Via della Lungara.
Remember to validate your tickets on the metro and buses, and be mindful of pickpockets, especially in crowded areas.
No matter which route you choose, you're sure to be awed by the grandeur of the Colosseum."""
```


```
directions_prompt = f"""
  From the given text, extract the following entities and return a list of them.
  Entities to extract: street name, form of transport.
  Text: {directions}
  Street = []
  Transport = [] """

Markdown(model.generate_content(directions_prompt).text)
```




```json
{
  "Street": [
    "Via dei Fori Imperiali",
    "Via del Corso",
    "Via della Lungara"
  ],
  "Transport": [
    "train",
    "metro",
    "bus",
    "Terravision shuttle",
    "taxi",
    "private transfer service"
  ]
}
```



You can modify the form of the answer for your extracted entities even more:


```
directions_list_prompt = f"""
  From the given text, extract the following entities and return a list of them.
  Entities to extract: street name, form of transport.
  Text: {directions}
  Return your answer as two lists:
  Street = [street names]
  Transport = [forms of transport]"""

Markdown(model.generate_content(directions_list_prompt).text)
```




Here are the extracted entities:

**Street:**
- Via dei Fori Imperiali
- Via del Corso
- Via della Lungara 

**Transport:**
- Train (Leonardo Express)
- Metro (line A)
- Bus (Terravision shuttle)

# Long Document Content Extraction
GPT-3 can help us extract key figures, dates or other bits of important content from documents that are too big to fit into the context window. One approach for solving this is to chunk the document up and process each chunk separately, before combining into one list of answers. 
In this notebook we'll run through this approach:
- Load in a long PDF and pull the text out
- Create a prompt to be used to extract key bits of information
- Chunk up our document and process each chunk to pull any answers out
- Combine them at the end
- This simple approach will then be extended to three more difficult questions
## Approach
- **Setup**: Take a PDF, a Formula 1 Financial Regulation document on Power Units, and extract the text from it for entity extraction. We'll use this to try to extract answers that are buried in the content.
- **Simple Entity Extraction**: Extract key bits of information from chunks of a document by:
    - Creating a template prompt with our questions and an example of the format it expects
    - Create a function to take a chunk of text as input, combine with the prompt and get a response
    - Run a script to chunk the text, extract answers and output them for parsing
- **Complex Entity Extraction**: Ask some more difficult questions which require tougher reasoning to work out

The `extractions` object is a collection that contains the extracted information. Each item in the collection is a string that represents a piece of information extracted from the document.

The `Where` method is a LINQ (Language Integrated Query) method that is used to filter the collection. The method takes a lambda expression `p => !p.Contains("Not specified")` as an argument. This expression is a function that takes an item from the collection (represented by `p`) and returns `true` if the item does not contain the string "Not specified", and `false` otherwise. In other words, this method filters out any items in the collection that contain the string "Not specified".

The `DisplayTable` method is then called on the filtered collection. This method displays the items in the collection as a table. Each item in the collection is displayed as a row in the table.

In summary, this code is used to filter out any items in the `extractions` collection that contain the string "Not specified", and then display the remaining items as a table.


```csharp
extractions.Where(p => !p.Contains("Not specified")).DisplayTable();

## Consolidation

We've been able to extract the first two answers safely, while the third was confounded by the date that appeared on every page, though the correct answer is in there as well.

To tune this further you can consider experimenting with:
- A more descriptive or specific prompt
- If you have sufficient training data, fine-tuning a model to find a set of outputs very well
- The way you chunk your data - we have gone for 1000 tokens with no overlap, but more intelligent chunking that breaks info into sections, cuts by tokens or similar may get better results

However, with minimal tuning we have now answered 6 questions of varying difficulty using the contents of a long document, and have a reusable approach that we can apply to any long document requiring entity extraction. Look forward to seeing what you can do with this!

  </td>
</table>

You will use Gemini to extract all fields that fit one of the predefined classes and label them.


```
!pip install -U -q "google-generativeai>=0.7.2"
```


```
import google.generativeai as genai

import json
from enum import Enum
from typing_extensions import TypedDict # in python 3.12 replace typing_extensions with typing
```

## Configure your API key

To run the following cell, your API key must be stored it in a Colab Secret named `GOOGLE_API_KEY`. If you don't already have an API key, or you're not sure how to create a Colab Secret, see [Authentication](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Authentication.ipynb) for an example.


```
from google.colab import userdata
GOOGLE_API_KEY=userdata.get('GOOGLE_API_KEY')

genai.configure(api_key=GOOGLE_API_KEY)
```

## Example


```
entity_recognition_text = "John Johnson, the CEO of the Oil Inc. and Coal Inc. companies, has unveiled plans to build a new factory in Houston, Texas."
prompt = f"""
Generate list of entities in text based on the following Python class structure:

class CategoryEnum(str, Enum):
    Person = 'Person'
    Company = 'Company'
    State = 'State'
    City = 'City'

class Entity(TypedDict):
  name: str
  category: CategoryEnum

class Entities(TypedDict):
  entities: list[Entity]

{entity_recognition_text}"""
model = genai.GenerativeModel(model_name='gemini-1.5-flash-latest', generation_config={"temperature": 0})
response = model.generate_content(prompt, generation_config={"response_mime_type": "application/json"})
```


```
print(json.dumps(json.loads(response.text), indent=4))
```

    {
        "entities": [
            {
                "name": "John Johnson",
                "category": "Person"
            },
            {
                "name": "Oil Inc.",
                "category": "Company"
            },
            {
                "name": "Coal Inc.",
                "category": "Company"
            },
            {
                "name": "Houston",
                "category": "City"
            },
            {
                "name": "Texas",
                "category": "State"
            }
        ]
    }
    

## Summary
You have used the Gemini API to extract entities of predefined categories with their labels. You extracted every person, company, state, and country. You are not limited to these categories, as this should work with any category of your choice.

Please see the other notebooks in this directory to learn more about how you can use the Gemini API for other JSON related tasks.

# Gemini API: Enum Quickstart

    <a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Enum.ipynb"><img src="../images/colab_logo_32px.png?raw=1" />Run in Google Colab</a>
  </td>
</table>

The Gemini API allows you to supply a schema to define function arguments (for [function calling](../quickstarts/Function_calling.ipynb)), or to constrain its output in [JSON](../quickstarts/JSON_mode.ipynb) or using an Enum. This tutorial gives some examples using enums.

### Install dependencies


```
!pip install -q -U "google-generativeai>=0.8.0"
```


```
import google.generativeai as genai

import json
import dataclasses
import typing_extensions as typing
```

### Configure your API key

To run the following cell, your API key must be stored in a Colab Secret named `GOOGLE_API_KEY`. If you don't already have an API key, or you're not sure how to create a Colab Secret, see [Authentication](../quickstarts/Authentication.ipynb) for an example.


```
from google.colab import userdata
GOOGLE_API_KEY=userdata.get('GOOGLE_API_KEY')

genai.configure(api_key=GOOGLE_API_KEY)
```

## Enums

In the simplest case is you need the model to choose one option from a list of choices, use an enum class to define the schema. Ask it to identify this instrument:


```
!curl -O https://storage.googleapis.com/generativeai-downloads/images/instrument.jpg

from PIL import Image

instrument = Image.open('instrument.jpg')
instrument
```

      % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                     Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
    
  0     0    0     0    0     0      0      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--     0
100  111k  100  111k    0     0   688k      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  691k
    




    
![png](output_11_1.png)
    



The response should be one of the following options:


```
import enum

class InstrumentClass(enum.Enum):
    PERCUSSION = "Percussion"
    STRING = "String"
    WOODWIND = "Woodwind"
    BRASS = "Brass"
    KEYBOARD = "Keyboard"
```

Pass the enum class as the `response_schema`, and for this simplest case you can use the `response_mime_type = "text/x.enum"` option to get one of those enum members as the response.


```
model = genai.GenerativeModel("gemini-1.5-flash-latest")


response = model.generate_content([instrument, 'what category of instrument is this?'],
                       generation_config={"response_mime_type": "text/x.enum",
                                          "response_schema":InstrumentClass})

print(response.text)
```

    Keyboard
    

You can also use enums with `response_mime_type = "application/json"`. In this simple case the response will be identical but in quotes.


```
response = model.generate_content([instrument, 'what category of instrument is this?'],
                       generation_config={"response_mime_type": "application/json",
                                          "response_schema":InstrumentClass})

print(response.text)
```

    "Keyboard" 
    

Outside of simple multiple choice problems, an enum can be used anywhere in the schema for [JSON](../quickstarts/JSON_mode.ipynb) or [function calling](../quickstarts/Function_calling.ipynb). For example, ask it for a list of recipe titles, and use a `Grade` enum to give each one a popularity-grade:


```
class Grade(enum.Enum):
  A_PLUS = 'a+'
  A = 'a'
  B = 'b'
  C = 'c'
  D = 'd'
  F = 'f'

class Recipe(typing.TypedDict):
  recipe_name: str
  grade: Grade
```

For this example you want a list of `Recipe` objects, so pass `list[Recipe]` to the `response_schema` field of the `generation_config`.


```
result = model.generate_content(
    "List about 10 cookie recipes, grade them based on popularity",
    generation_config=genai.GenerationConfig(
        response_mime_type="application/json",
        response_schema = list[Recipe]),
    request_options={"timeout": 600},
)
```


```
response = json.loads(result.text)
print(json.dumps(response, indent=4))
```

    [
        {
            "grade": "a+",
            "recipe_name": "Chocolate Chip Cookies"
        },
        {
            "grade": "a",
            "recipe_name": "Oatmeal Raisin Cookies"
        },
        {
            "grade": "a",
            "recipe_name": "Snickerdoodles"
        },
        {
            "grade": "b",
            "recipe_name": "Peanut Butter Cookies"
        },
        {
            "grade": "b",
            "recipe_name": "Sugar Cookies"
        },
        {
            "grade": "c",
            "recipe_name": "Shortbread Cookies"
        },
        {
            "grade": "c",
            "recipe_name": "Gingerbread Cookies"
        },
        {
            "grade": "d",
            "recipe_name": "Macadamia Nut Cookies"
        },
        {
            "grade": "d",
            "recipe_name": "Biscotti"
        },
        {
            "grade": "f",
            "recipe_name": "Linzer Cookies"
        }
    ]
    

## Next Steps
### Useful API references:

Check the [structured ouput](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/structured-output) documentation or the [`GenerationConfig`](https://ai.google.dev/api/generate-content#generationconfig) API reference for more details.

### Related examples

* The constrained output is used in the [Text summarization](../examples/json_capabilities/Text_Summarization.ipynb) example to provide the model a format to summarize a story (genre, characters, etc...)
* The [Object detection](../examples/Object_detection.ipynb) examples are using the JSON constrained output to uniiformize the output of the detection.

### Continue your discovery of the Gemini API

An Enum is not the only way to constrain the output of the model, you can also use an [JSON](../quickstarts/Enum.ipynb) schema. [Function calling](../quickstarts/Function_calling.ipynb) and [Code execution](../quickstarts/Code_Execution.ipynb) are other ways to enhance your model by either let him use your own functions or by letting it write and run them.

# Epsilla

>[Epsilla](https://www.epsilla.com) is an open-source vector database that leverages the advanced parallel graph traversal techniques for vector indexing. Epsilla is licensed under GPL-3.0.

You'll need to install `langchain-community` with `pip install -qU langchain-community` to use this integration

This notebook shows how to use the functionalities related to the `Epsilla` vector database.

As a prerequisite, you need to have a running Epsilla vector database (for example, through our docker image), and install the ``pyepsilla`` package. View full docs at [docs](https://epsilla-inc.gitbook.io/epsilladb/quick-start).


```python
!pip/pip3 install pyepsilla
```

We want to use OpenAIEmbeddings so we have to get the OpenAI API Key. 


```python
import getpass
import os

if "OPENAI_API_KEY" not in os.environ:
    os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("OpenAI API Key:")
```

OpenAI API Key: ········


```python
from langchain_community.vectorstores import Epsilla
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
```


```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import TextLoader
from langchain_text_splitters import CharacterTextSplitter

loader = TextLoader("../../how_to/state_of_the_union.txt")
documents = loader.load()

documents = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0).split_documents(
    documents
)

embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
```

Epsilla vectordb is running with default host "localhost" and port "8888". We have a custom db path, db name and collection name instead of the default ones.


```python
from pyepsilla import vectordb

client = vectordb.Client()
vector_store = Epsilla.from_documents(
    documents,
    embeddings,
    client,
    db_path="/tmp/mypath",
    db_name="MyDB",
    collection_name="MyCollection",
)
```


```python
query = "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"
docs = vector_store.similarity_search(query)
print(docs[0].page_content)
```

In state after state, new laws have been passed, not only to suppress the vote, but to subvert entire elections.

We cannot let this happen.

Tonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you’re at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections.

Tonight, I’d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer—an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service.

One of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court.

And I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation’s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence.

# EPub 

>[EPUB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB) is an e-book file format that uses the ".epub" file extension.

The modern\nfanciful story is here placed next to the real folk story instead of\nafter all the groups of folk products. The Hebrew stories at the\nbeginning belong quite as well, perhaps even better, in Section V, while\nthe stories at the end of Section VI shade off into the more modern\ntypes of short tales. Then the fact that other groups of modern stories\nare to follow later, illustrating more realistic studies of life and the\nvery recent and remarkably numerous writings centering around animal\nlife, limits the list here. Many of the animal stories might, with equal\npropriety, be placed under the head of the fantastic.\n\nThe child\'s natural literature. The\nworld has lost certain secrets as the price of an advancing\ncivilization. It is a commonplace of observation that no one can\nduplicate the success of Mother Goose, whether she be thought of as the\nmaker of jingles or the teller of tales. The conditions of modern life\npreclude the generally naïve attitude that produced the folk rhymes,\nballads, tales, proverbs, fables, and myths. The folk saw things simply\nand directly. The complex, analytic, questioning mind is not yet, either\nin or out of stories. The motives from which people act are to them\nplain and not mixed. Characters are good or bad. They feel no need of\nelaborately explaining their joys and sorrows. Such experiences come\nwith the day\'s work. "To-morrow to fresh woods, and pastures new." The\nzest of life with them is emphatic. Their humor is fresh, unbounded,\nsincere; there is no trace of cynicism. In folk literature we do not\nfeel the presence of a "writer" who is mightily concerned about\nmaintaining his reputation for wisdom, originality, or style. Hence the\nfreedom from any note of straining after effect, of artificiality. In\nthe midst of a life limited to fundamental needs, their literature deals\nwith fundamentals. On the whole, it was a literature for entertainment.\nA more learned upper class may have concerned itself then about\n"problems" and "purposes," as the whole world does now, but the\nliterature of the folk had no such interests.\n\nWithout discussing the limits of the culture-epoch theory of human\ndevelopment as a complete guide in education, it is clear that the young\nchild passes through a period when his mind looks out upon the world in\na manner analogous to that of the folk as expressed in their literature.\nQuarrel with the fact as we may, it still remains a fact that his nature\ncraves these old stories and will not be satisfied with something "just\nas good."\n\nThe modern fairy story. The advance\nof civilization has been accompanied by a wistful longing for the\nsimplicities left by the way. In some periods this interest in the past\nhas been more marked than in others. When the machinery of life has\nweighed too heavily on the human spirit, men have turned for relief to a\ncontemplation of the "good old times" and have preached crusades of a\n"return to nature." 172 Many modern writers have tried to recapture some\nof the power of the folk tale by imitating its method. In many cases\nthey have had a fair degree of success: in one case, that of Hans\nChristian Andersen, the success is admittedly very complete. As a rule,\nhowever, the sharpness of the sense of wonder has been blunted, and many\nimitators of the old fairy tale succeed in keeping only the shell.\nAnother class of modern fantastic tale is that of the pourquoi story, which has the explanation of something\nas its object. Such tales grow out of the attempt to use the charm of\nold stories as a means of conveying instruction, somewhat after the\nmethod of those parents who covered up our bitter medicine with some of\nour favorite jam. Even "Little Red Riding Hood," as we saw, has been\nturned into a flower myth. So compelling is this pedagogical motive that\nso-called nature myths have been invented or made from existing stories\nin great numbers. The practical results please many teachers, but it may\nbe questioned whether the gain is sufficient to compensate children for\nthe distorting results upon masterpieces.\n\nWide range of the modern fairy tale.\nThe bibliography will suggest something of the treasures in the field of\nthe modern fanciful story. From the delightful nonsense of Alice\nin Wonderland and the "travelers\' tales" of Baron\nMunchausen to the profound seriousness of The King of the\nGolden River and Why the Chimes Rang is a far cry.\nThere are the rich fancies of Barrie and Maeterlinck, at the same time\ndelicate as the promises of spring and brilliant as the fruitions of\nsummer. One may be blown away to the land of Oz, he may lose his shadow\nwith Peter Schlemihl, he may outdo the magic carpet with his\nTraveling-Cloak, he may visit the courts of kings with his Wonderful\nChair; Miss Muffet will invite us to her Christmas party, Lemuel\nGulliver will lead us to lands not marked in the school atlas; on every\nside is a world of wonder.\n\nSome qualities of these modern tales.\nEvery age produces after its own fashion, and we must expect to find the\nmodern user of the fairy-story method expressing through it the\nqualities of his own outlook upon the world. Interest in the picturesque\naspects of landscape will be emphasized, as in the early portions of\n"The Story of Fairyfoot" and, with especial magnificence of style,\nthroughout The King of the Golden River. There will appear\nthe saddened mood of the modern in the face of the human miseries that\nmake happiness a mockery, as in "The Happy Prince." The destructive\neffects of the possessive instinct upon all that is finest in human\nnature is reflected in "The Prince\'s Dream." That the most valuable\nefforts are often those performed with least spectacular settings may be\ndiscerned in "The Knights of the Silver Shield," while the lesson of\nkindly helpfulness is the burden of "Old Pipes and the Dryad." In many\nmodern stories the reader is too much aware of the conscious efforts of\nstyle and structure. The thoughtful child will sometimes be too much\ndistressed by the more somber modern story, and should not hear too many\nof the gloomy type.\n\nAndersen the consummate master. Hans\nChristian Andersen is the acknowledged master of the modern story for\nchildren. What are the sources of his success? Genius is always\nunexplainable except in terms of itself, but some things are clear. To\nbegin, he makes a mark—drives down a peg: "There came a soldier marching\nalong 173 the high road—one, two! one, two!" and\nyou are off. No backing and filling, no jockeying for position, no\nelaborate setting of the stage. The story\'s the thing! Next, the\nlanguage is the language of common oral speech, free and unrestrained.\nThe rigid forms of the grammar are eschewed. There is no beating around\nthe bush. Seeing through the eyes of the child, he uses the language\nthat is natural to such sight: "Aha! there sat the dog with eyes as big\nas mill-wheels." In quick dramatic fashion the story unrolls before your\nvision: "So the soldier cut the witch\'s head off. There she lay!" No\nagonizing over the cruelty of it, the lack of sympathy. It is a joke\nafter the child\'s own heart, and with a hearty laugh at this end to an\nimpostor, the listener is on with the story. The logic is the logic of\nchildhood: "And everyone could see she was a real princess, for she was\nso lovely." When Andersen deals with some of the deeper truths of\nexistence, as in "The Nightingale" or "The Ugly Duckling," he still\nmanages to throw it all into the form that is natural and convincing and\nsimple to the child. He never mounts a pedestal and becomes a grown-up\nphilosopher. Perhaps Andersen\'s secret lay in the fact that some fairy\ngodmother invested him at birth with a power to see things so completely\nas a child sees them that he never questioned the dignity of the method.\nIn few of his stories is there any evidence of a constraint due to a\nconscious attempt to write down to the understandings of children.\n\nSUGGESTIONS FOR READING\n\nThe most valuable discussion of the difficulties to be mastered in\nwriting the literary fairy tale, and the story of the only very complete\nmastery yet made, will be found in the account of Hans Christian\nAndersen in Eminent Authors of the Nineteenth Century, by\nGeorg Brandes. Now and then hints of importance on such stories and\ntheir value for children may be found in biographies of the more\nprominent writers represented in the section and mentioned in the\nbibliography, and in magazine articles and reviews. These latter may be\nlocated by use of the periodical indexes found in most libraries. For\nthe proper attitude which the schools should have toward fiction and\nfanciful writing in general, nothing could be better than two lectures\non "Children\'s Reading," in On the Art of Reading, by Sir\nArthur Quiller-Couch.\n\n174\n\n190\n\nThe rabbis of old were good story-tellers. They were essentially\nteachers and they understood that the best sermon is a story. "They were\nfond of the parable, the anecdote, the apt illustration, and their\nlegends that have been transmitted to us, all aglow with the light and\nlife of the Orient, possess perennial charm." It is possible to find in\nrabbinical sources a large number of brief stories that have the power\nof entertaining as well as of emphasizing some qualities of character\nthat are important in all ages. The plan of this book does not include\nthe wonderful stories of the Old Testament, which are easy of access to\nany teacher and may be used as experience directs. The Hebrew stories\nfollowing correspond very nearly to the folk anecdote and are placed in\nthis section because of their literary form.\n\nDr. Abram S. Isaacs (1851—) is a professor in New York University and\nis also a rabbi. The selection that follows is from his Stories\nfrom the Rabbis. (Copyrighted. Used by special permission of The\nBloch Publishing Company, New York.) Taking advantage of the popular\nsuperstition that a four-leaved clover is a sign of good luck, Dr.\nIsaacs has grouped together four parable-like stories, each of which\ndeals with wealth as a subject. The editors are responsible for the\nspecial titles given. The messages of these stories might be summarized\nas follows: If you would be lucky, (1) be honest because it is right to\nbe honest, (2) value good friends more highly than gold, (3) let love\naccompany each gift of charity, and (4) use common sense in your\nbusiness ventures.\n\nA FOUR-LEAVED CLOVER\n\nABRAM S. ISAACS\n\n1. The Rabbi and The Diadem\n\nGreat was the alarm in the palace of Rome, which soon spread\nthroughout the entire city. The Empress had lost her costly diadem, and\nit could not be found. They searched in every direction, but it was all\nin vain. Half distracted, for the mishap boded no good to her or her\nhouse, the Empress redoubled her exertions to regain her precious\npossession, but without result. As a last resource it was proclaimed in\nthe public streets:\n\n"The Empress has lost a priceless diadem. Whoever restores it within\nthirty days shall receive a princely reward. But he who delays, and\nbrings it after thirty days, shall lose his head."\n\nIn those times all nationalities flocked toward Rome; all classes and\ncreeds could be met in its stately halls and crowded thoroughfares.\nAmong the rest was a rabbi, a learnèd sage from the East, who loved\ngoodness and lived a righteous life, in the stir and turmoil of the\nWestern world. It chanced one night as he was strolling up and down, in\nbusy meditation, beneath the clear, moonlit sky, he saw the diadem\nsparkling at his feet. He seized it quickly, brought it to his dwelling,\nwhere he guarded it carefully until the thirty days had expired, when he\nresolved to return it to the owner.\n\nHe proceeded to the palace, and, undismayed at sight of long lines of\nsoldiery and officials, asked for an audience with the Empress.\n\n"What dost thou mean by this?" she inquired, when he told her his\nstory and gave her the diadem. "Why didst thou delay until this hour?\nDost thou know the penalty? Thy head must be forfeited."\n\n"I delayed until now," the rabbi answered calmly, "so that thou\nmightst know that I return thy diadem, not for the sake of the reward,\nstill less out of fear of punishment; but solely to comply 175 with\nthe Divine command not to withhold from another the property which\nbelongs to him."\n\n"Blessed be thy God!" the Empress answered, and dismissed the rabbi\nwithout further reproof; for had he not done right for right\'s sake?\n\n2. Friendship\n\nA certain father was doubly blessed—he had reached a good old age,\nand had ten sons. One day he called them to his side, and after repeated\nexpressions of affection, told them that he had acquired a fortune by\nindustry and economy, and would give them one hundred gold pieces each\nbefore his death, so that they might begin business for themselves, and\nnot be obliged to wait until he had passed away. It happened, however,\nthat, soon after, he lost a portion of his property, much to his regret,\nand had only nine hundred and fifty gold pieces left. So he gave one\nhundred to each of his nine sons. When his youngest son, whom he loved\nmost of all, asked naturally what was to be his share, the father\nreplied:\n\n"My son, I promised to give each of thy brothers one hundred gold\npieces. I shall keep my word to them. I have fifty left. Thirty I shall\nreserve for my funeral expenses, and twenty will be thy portion. But\nunderstand this—I possess, in addition, ten friends, whom I give over to\nthee as compensation for the loss of the eighty gold pieces. Believe me,\nthey are worth more than all the gold and silver."\n\nThe youth tenderly embraced his parent, and assured him that he was\ncontent, such was his confidence and affection. In a few days the father\ndied, and the nine sons took their money, and without a thought of their\nyoungest brother and the small amount he had received, followed each his\nown fancy. But the youngest son, although his portion was the least,\nresolved to heed his father\'s words, and hold fast to the ten friends.\nWhen a short time had elapsed he prepared a simple feast, went to the\nten friends of his father, and said to them: "My father, almost in his\nlast words, asked me to keep you, his friends, in honor. Before I leave\nthis place to seek my fortune elsewhere, will you not share with me a\nfarewell meal, and aid me thus to comply with his dying request?"\n\nThe ten friends, stirred by his earnestness and cordiality, accepted\nhis invitation with pleasure, and enjoyed the repast, although they were\nused to richer fare. When the moment for parting arrived, however, one\nof them rose and spoke: "My friends, it seems to me that of all the sons\nof our dear friend that has gone, the youngest alone is mindful of his\nfather\'s friendship for us, and reverences his memory. Let us, then, be\ntrue friends to him, for his own sake as well, and provide for him a\ngenerous sum, that he may begin business here, and not be forced to live\namong strangers."\n\nThe proposal, so unexpected and yet so merited, was received with\napplause. The youth, proud of their friendship, soon became a prosperous\nmerchant, who never forgot that faithful friends were more valuable than\ngold or silver, and left an honored name to his descendants.\n\n3. True Charity\n\nThere lived once a very wealthy man, who cared little for money,\nexcept as 176 a means for helping others. He used to adopt a\npeculiar plan in his method of charitable relief. He had three boxes\nmade for the three different classes of people whom he desired to\nassist. In one box he put gold pieces, which he distributed among\nartists and scholars, for he honored knowledge and learning as the\nhighest possession. In the second box he placed silver pieces for widows\nand orphans, for whom his sympathies were readily awakened. In the third\nwere copper coins for the general poor and beggars—no one was turned\naway from his dwelling without some gift, however small.\n\nThat the man was beloved by all, need hardly be said. He rejoiced\nthat he was enabled to do so much good, retained his modest bearing, and\ncontinued to regard his wealth as only an incentive to promote the\nhappiness of mankind, without distinction of creed or nationality.\nUnhappily, his wife was just the opposite. She rarely gave food or\nraiment to the poor, and felt angry at her husband\'s liberality, which\nshe considered shameless extravagance.\n\nThe day came when in the pressure of various duties he had to leave\nhis house, and could not return until the morrow. Unaware of his sudden\ndeparture, the poor knocked at the door as usual for his kind gifts; but\nwhen they found him absent, they were about to go away or remain in the\nstreet, being terrified at the thought of asking his wife for alms.\nVexed at their conduct, she exclaimed impetuously: "I will give to the\npoor according to my husband\'s method."\n\nShe seized the keys of the boxes, and first opened the box of gold.\nBut how great was her terror when she gazed at its contents—frogs\njumping here and there. Then she went to the silver box, and it was full\nof ants. With troubled heart, she opened the copper box, and it was\ncrowded with creeping bugs. Loud then were her complaints, and bitter\nher tears, at the deception, and she kept her room until her husband\nreturned.\n\nNo sooner did the man enter the room, annoyed that so many poor\npeople were kept waiting outside, than she asked him: "Why did you give\nme keys to boxes of frogs, ants, and bugs, instead of gold, silver, and\ncopper? Was it right thus to deceive your wife, and disappoint the\npoor?"\n\n"Not so," rejoined her husband. "The mistake must be yours, not mine.\nI have given you the right keys. I do not know what you have done with\nthem. Come, let me have them. I am guiltless of any deception." He took\nthe keys, quickly opened the boxes, and found the coins as he had left\nthem. "Ah, dear wife," said he, when she had regained her composure,\n"your heart, I fear, was not in the gift, when you wished to give to the\npoor. It is the feeling that prompts us to aid, not the mere money,\nwhich is the chief thing after all."\n\nAnd ever after, her heart was changed. Her gifts blessed the poor of\nthe land, and aroused their love and reverence.\n\n4. An Eastern Garden\n\nIn an Eastern city a lovely garden flourished, whose beauty and\nluxuriance awakened much admiration. It was the owner\'s greatest\npleasure to watch its growth, as leaf, flower, and tree seemed daily to\nunfold to brighter bloom. One morning, while taking his usual stroll\nthrough the well-kept paths, 177 he was surprised to find that\nsome blossoms were picked to pieces. The next day he noticed more signs\nof mischief, and rendered thus more observant he gave himself no rest\nuntil he had discovered the culprit. It was a little trembling bird,\nwhom he managed to capture, and was about to kill in his anger, when it\nexclaimed: "Do not kill me, I beg you, kind sir. I am only a wee, tiny\nbird. My flesh is too little to satisfy you. I would not furnish\none-hundredth of a meal to a man of your size. Let me free without any\nhesitation, and I shall teach you something that will be of much use to\nyou and your friends."\n\n"I would dearly like to put an end to you," replied the man, "for you\nwere rapidly putting an end to my garden. It is a good thing to rid the\nworld of such annoyances. But as I am not revengeful, and am always glad\nto learn something useful, I shall set you free this time." And he\nopened his hand to give the bird more air.\n\n"Attention!" cried the bird. "Here are three rules which should guide\nyou through life, and if you observe them you will find your path made\neasier: Do not cry over spilt milk; do not desire what is unattainable,\nand do not believe what is impossible."\n\nThe man was satisfied with the advice, and let the bird escape; but\nit had scarcely regained its liberty, when, from a high tree opposite,\nit exclaimed:\n\n"What a silly man! The idea of letting me escape! If you only knew\nwhat you have lost! But it is too late now."\n\n"What have I lost?" the man asked, angrily.\n\n"Why, if you had killed me, as you intended, you would have found\ninside of me a huge pearl, as large as a goose\'s egg, and you would have\nbeen a wealthy man forever."\n\n"Dear little bird," the man said in his blandest tones; "sweet little\nbird, I will not harm you. Only come down to me, and I will treat you as\nif you were my own child, and give you fruit and flowers all day. I\nassure you of this most sacredly."\n\nBut the bird shook its head sagely, and replied: "What a silly man,\nto forget so soon the advice which was given him in all seriousness. I\ntold you not to cry over spilt milk, and here you are, worrying over\nwhat has happened. I urged you not to desire the unattainable, and now\nyou wish to capture me again. And, finally, I asked you not to believe\nwhat is impossible, and you are rashly imagining that I have a huge\npearl inside of me, when a goose\'s egg is larger than my whole body. You\nought to learn your lessons better in the future, if you would become\nwise," added the bird, as with another twist of its head it flew away,\nand was lost in the distance.\n\n191\n\nA classic collection of short stories from the ancient Hebrew sages\nis the little book, Hebrew Tales, published in London in\n1826 by the noted Jewish scholar Hyman Hurwitz (1770-1844). A modern\nhandy edition of this book (about sixty tales) is published as Vol. II\nof the Library of Jewish Classics. Of special interest is the fact that\nit contained three stories by the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who had\npublished them first in his periodical, The Friend.\nColeridge was much interested in Hebrew literature, and especially fond\nof speaking in parables, as those who know "The Ancient Mariner" will\nreadily recall. The 178 following is one of the three stories referred\nto, and it had prefixed to it the significant text, "The Lord helpeth\nman and beast." (Psalm XXXVI, 6.)\n\nTHE LORD HELPETH MAN AND BEAST\n\nSAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE\n\nDuring his march to conquer the world, Alexander, the Macedonian,\ncame to a people in Africa who dwelt in a remote and secluded corner, in\npeaceful huts, and knew neither war nor conqueror. They led him to the\nhut of their chief, who received him hospitably, and placed before him\ngolden dates, golden figs, and bread of gold.\n\n"Do you eat gold in this country?" said Alexander.\n\n"I take it for granted," replied the chief, "that thou wert able to\nfind eatable food in thine own country. For what reason, then, art thou\ncome amongst us?"\n\n"Your gold has not tempted me hither," said Alexander, "but I would\nbecome acquainted with your manners and customs."\n\n"So be it," rejoined the other: "sojourn among us as long as it\npleaseth thee."\n\nAt the close of this conversation, two citizens entered, as into\ntheir court of justice. The plaintiff said, "I bought of this man a\npiece of land, and as I was making a deep drain through it, I found a\ntreasure. This is not mine, for I only bargained for the land, and not\nfor any treasure that might be concealed beneath it; and yet the former\nowner of the land will not receive it." The defendant answered, "I hope\nI have a conscience, as well as my fellow citizen. I sold him the land\nwith all its contingent, as well as existing advantages, and\nconsequently, the treasure inclusively."\n\nThe chief, who was at the same time their supreme judge,\nrecapitulated their words, in order that the parties might see whether\nor not he understood them aright. Then, after some reflection, said:\n"Thou hast a son, friend, I believe?"\n\n"Yes."\n\n"And thou," addressing the other, "a daughter?"\n\n"Yes."\n\n"Well, then, let thy son marry thy daughter, and bestow the\ntreasure on the young couple for a marriage portion." Alexander seemed\nsurprised and perplexed. "Think you my sentence unjust?" the chief asked\nhim.\n\n"Oh, no!" replied Alexander; "but it astonishes me."\n\n"And how, then," rejoined the chief, "would the case have been\ndecided in your country?"\n\n"To confess the truth," said Alexander, "we should have taken both\nparties into custody, and have seized the treasure for the king\'s\nuse."\n\n"For the king\'s use!" exclaimed the chief; "does the sun shine on\nthat country?"\n\n"Oh, yes!"\n\n"Does it rain there?"\n\n"Assuredly."\n\n"Wonderful! But are there tame animals in the country, that live on\nthe grass and green herbs?"\n\n"Very many, and of many kinds."\n\n"Ay, that must, then, be the cause," said the chief: "for the sake of\nthose innocent animals the All-gracious Being continues to let the sun\nshine, and the rain drop down on your country; since its inhabitants are\nunworthy of such blessings." 179\n\n192\n\nBy almost common consent Hans Christian Andersen (1805-1875), the\nDanish author, is the acknowledged master of all modern writers of fairy\ntales. He was born in poverty, the son of a poor shoemaker. With a\nnaturally keen dramatic sense, his imagination was stirred by stories\nfrom the Arabian Nights and La Fontaine\'s\nFables, by French and Spanish soldiers marching through his\nnative city, and by listening to the wonderful folk tales of his\ncountry. On a toy stage and with toy actors, these vivid impressions\ntook actual form. The world continued a dramatic spectacle to him\nthroughout his existence. His consuming ambition was for the stage, but\nhe had none of the personal graces so necessary for success. He was\nungainly and awkward, like his "ugly duckling." But when at last he\nbegan to write, he had the power to transfer to the page the vivid\ndramas in his mind, and this power culminated in the creation of fairy\nstories for children which he began to publish in 1835. It is usual to\nsay that Andersen, like Peter Pan, "never grew up," and it is certain\nthat he never lost the power of seeing things as children see them. Like\nmany great writers whose fame now rests on the suffrages of child\nreaders, Andersen seems at first to have felt that the\nTales were slight and beneath his dignity. They are not all\nof the same high quality. Occasionally one of them becomes "too\nsentimental and sickly sweet," but the best of them have a sturdiness\nthat is thoroughly refreshing.\n\nThe most acute analysis of the elements of Andersen\'s greatness as\nthe ideal writer for children is that made by his fellow-countryman\nGeorg Brandes in Eminent Authors of the Nineteenth Century.\nA briefer account on similar lines will be found in H. J. Boyesen\'s\nScandinavian Literature. A still briefer account, eminently\nsatisfactory for an introduction to Andersen, by Benjamin W. Wells, is\nin Warner\'s Library of the World\'s Best Literature. The\ninterested student cannot, of course, afford to neglect Andersen\'s own\nThe Story of My Life. Among the more elaborate biographies\nthe Life of Hans Christian Andersen by R. Nisbet Bain is\nprobably the best. The first translation of the Tales into\nEnglish was made by Mary Howitt in 1846 and, as far as it goes, is still\nregarded as one of the finest. However, Andersen has been very fortunate\nin his many translators. The version by H. W. Dulcken has been published\nin many cheap forms and perhaps more widely read than any other. In\naddition to the stories in the following pages, some of those most\nsuitable for use are "The Little Match Girl," "The Silver Shilling,"\n"Five Peas in the Pod," "Hans Clodhopper," and "The Snow Queen." The\nlatter is one of the longest and an undoubted masterpiece.\n\nThe first two stories following are taken from Mrs. Henderson\'s\nAndersen\'s Best Fairy Tales. (Copyright. Rand McNally &\nCo.) This little book contains thirteen stories in a very simple\ntranslation and also an excellent story of Andersen\'s life in a form\nmost attractive to children. "The Princess and the Pea" is a story for\nthe story\'s sake. The humor, perhaps slightly satirical, is based upon\nthe notion so common in the old folk tales that royal personages are\ndecidedly more delicate than the person of low degree. However, the\ntendency to think oneself of more consequence than another is not\nconfined to any one class.\n\nTHE REAL PRINCESS\n\n\nHANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN\n\n(Version by Alice Corbin Henderson)\n\nThere was once a Prince who wanted to marry a Princess. But it was\nonly a real Princess that he wanted to marry.\n\nHe traveled all over the world to find a real one. But, although\nthere were 180 plenty of princesses, whether they were\nreal princesses he could never discover. There was always\nsomething that did not seem quite right about them.\n\nAt last he had to come home again. But he was very sad, because he\nwanted to marry a real Princess.\n\nOne night there was a terrible storm. It thundered and lightened and\nthe rain poured down in torrents. In the middle of the storm there came\na knocking, knocking, knocking at the castle gate. The kind old King\nhimself went down to open the castle gate.\n\nIt was a young Princess that stood outside the gate. The wind and the\nrain had almost blown her to pieces. Water streamed out of her hair and\nout of her clothes. Water ran in at the points of her shoes and out\nagain at the heels. Yet she said that she was a real\nPrincess.\n\n"Well, we will soon find out about that!" thought the Queen.\n\nShe said nothing, but went into the bedroom, took off all the\nbedding, and put a small dried pea on the bottom of the bedstead. Then\nshe piled twenty mattresses on top of the pea, and on top of these she\nput twenty feather beds. This was where the Princess had to sleep that\nnight.\n\nIn the morning they asked her how she had slept through the\nnight.\n\n"Oh, miserably!" said the Princess. "I hardly closed my eyes the\nwhole night long! Goodness only knows what was in my bed! I slept upon\nsomething so hard that I am black and blue all over. It was\ndreadful!"\n\nSo then they knew that she was a real Princess. For, through\nthe twenty mattresses and the twenty feather beds, she had still felt\nthe pea. No one but a real Princess could have had such a\ntender skin.\n\nSo the Prince took her for his wife. He knew now that he had a\nreal Princess.\n\nAs for the pea, it was put in a museum where it may still be seen if\nno one has carried it away.\n\nNow this is a true story!\n\n193\n\nWith some dozen exceptions, all of Andersen\'s Tales are\nbased upon older stories, either upon some old folk tale or upon\nsomething that he ran across in his reading. Dr. Brandes, in his\nEminent Authors, shows in detail how "The Emperor\'s New Clothes"\ncame into being. "One day in turning over the leaves of Don Manuel\'s\nCount Lucanor, Andersen became charmed by the homely wisdom\nof the old Spanish story, with the delicate flavor of the Middle Ages\npervading it, and he lingered over chapter vii, which treats of how a\nking was served by three rogues." But Andersen\'s story is a very\ndifferent one in many ways from his Spanish original. For one thing, the\nmeaning is so universal that no one can miss it. Most of us have, in all\nlikelihood, at some time pretended to know what we do not know or to be\nwhat we are not in order to save our face, to avoid the censure or\nridicule of others. "There is much concerning which people dare not\nspeak the truth, through cowardice, through fear of acting otherwise\nthan \'all the world,\' through anxiety lest they should appear stupid.\nAnd the story is eternally new and it never ends. It has its grave side,\nbut just because of its endlessness it has also its humorous side." When\nthe absurd bubble of the grand procession is punctured by the child,\nwhose mental honesty has not yet been spoiled by the pressure of\nconvention, the Emperor "held himself stiffer than ever, and the\nchamberlains carried the invisible train." For it would never do to hold\nup the procession!\n\nTranscriber\'s Note: original reads \'Emporer\'s\'\n\n181\n\nTHE EMPEROR\'S NEW CLOTHES\n\n\nHANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN\n\n(Version by Alice Corbin Henderson)\n\nMany years ago there lived an Emperor who thought so much of new\nclothes that he spent all his money on them. He did not care for his\nsoldiers; he did not care to go to the theater. He liked to drive out in\nthe park only that he might show off his new clothes. He had a coat for\nevery hour of the day. They usually say of a king, "He is in the council\nchamber." But of the Emperor they said, "He is in the clothes\ncloset!"\n\nIt was a gay city in which the Emperor lived. And many strangers came\nto visit it every day. Among these, one day, there came two rogues who\nset themselves up as weavers. They said they knew how to weave the most\nbeautiful cloths imaginable. And not only were the colors and patterns\nused remarkably beautiful, but clothes made from this cloth could not be\nseen by any one who was unfit for the office he held or was too stupid\nfor any use.\n\n"Those would be fine clothes!" thought the Emperor. "If I wore those\nI could find out what men in my empire were not fit for the places they\nheld. I could tell the clever men from the dunces! I must have some\nclothes woven for me at once!"\n\nSo he gave the two rogues a great deal of money that they might begin\ntheir work at once.\n\nThe rogues immediately put up two looms and pretended to be working.\nBut there was nothing at all on their looms. They called for the finest\nsilks and the brightest gold, but this they put into their pockets. At\nthe empty looms they worked steadily until late into the night.\n\n"I should like to know how the weavers are getting on with my\nclothes," thought the Emperor.\n\nBut he felt a little uneasy when he thought that any one who was\nstupid or was not fit for his office would be unable to see the cloth.\nOf course he had no fears for himself; but still he thought he would\nsend some one else first, just to see how matters stood.\n\n"I will send my faithful old Minister to the weavers," thought the\nEmperor. "He can see how the stuff looks, for he is a clever man, and no\none is so careful in fulfilling duties as he is!"\n\nSo the good old Minister went into the room where the two rogues sat\nworking at the empty looms.\n\n"Mercy on us!" thought the old Minister, opening his eyes wide, "I\ncan\'t see a thing!" But he didn\'t care to say so.\n\nBoth the rascals begged him to be good enough to step a little\nnearer. They pointed to the empty looms and asked him if he did not\nthink the pattern and the coloring wonderful. The poor old Minister\nstared and stared as hard as he could, but he could not see anything,\nfor, of course, there was nothing to see!\n\n"Mercy!" he said to himself. "Is it possible that I am a dunce? I\nnever thought so! Certainly no one must know it. Am I unfit for office?\nIt will never do to say that I cannot see the stuff!"\n\n"Well, sir, why do you say nothing of it?" asked the rogue who was\npretending to weave.\n\n"Oh, it is beautiful—charming!" said the old Minister, peering\nthrough his spectacles. "What a fine pattern, and what wonderful colors!\nI shall tell the Emperor that I am very much pleased with it." 182\n\n"Well, we are glad to hear you say so," answered the two\nswindlers.\n\nThen they named all the colors of the invisible cloth upon the looms,\nand described the peculiar pattern. The old Minister listened intently,\nso that he could repeat all that was said of it to the Emperor.\n\nThe rogues now began to demand more money, more silk, and more gold\nthread in order to proceed with the weaving. All of this, of course,\nwent into their pockets. Not a single strand was ever put on the empty\nlooms at which they went on working.\n\nThe Emperor soon sent another faithful friend to see how soon the new\nclothes would be ready. But he fared no better than the Minister. He\nlooked and looked and looked, but still saw nothing but the empty\nlooms.\n\n"Isn\'t that a pretty piece of stuff?" asked both rogues, showing and\nexplaining the handsome pattern which was not there at all.\n\n"I am not stupid!" thought the man. "It must be that I am not worthy\nof my good position. That is, indeed, strange. But I must not let it be\nknown!"\n\nSo he praised the cloth he did not see, and expressed his approval of\nthe color and the design that were not there. To the Emperor he said,\n"It is charming!"\n\nSoon everybody in town was talking about the wonderful cloth that the\ntwo rogues were weaving.\n\nThe Emperor began to think now that he himself would like to see the\nwonderful cloth while it was still on the looms. Accompanied by a number\nof his friends, among whom were the two faithful officers who had\nalready beheld the imaginary stuff, he went to visit the two men who\nwere weaving, might and main, without any fiber and without any\nthread.\n\n"Isn\'t it splendid!" cried the two statesmen who had already been\nthere, and who thought the others would see something upon the empty\nlooms. "Look, your Majesty! What colors! And what a design!"\n\n"What\'s this?" thought the Emperor. "I see nothing at all! Am I a\ndunce? Am I not fit to be Emperor? That would be the worst thing that\ncould happen to me, if it were true."\n\n"Oh, it is very pretty!" said the Emperor aloud. "It has my highest\napproval!"\n\nHe nodded his head happily, and stared at the empty looms. Never\nwould he say that he could see nothing!\n\nHis friends, too, gazed and gazed, but saw no more than had the\nothers. Yet they all cried out, "It is beautiful!" and advised the\nEmperor to wear a suit made of this cloth in a great procession that was\nsoon to take place.\n\n"It is magnificent, gorgeous!" was the cry that went from mouth to\nmouth. The Emperor gave each of the rogues a royal ribbon to wear in his\nbuttonhole, and called them the Imperial Court Weavers.\n\nThe rogues were up the whole night before the morning of the\nprocession. They kept more than sixteen candles burning. The people\ncould see them hard at work, completing the new clothes of the Emperor.\nThey took yards of stuff down from the empty looms; they made cuts in\nthe air with big scissors; they sewed with needles without thread; and,\nat last, they said, "The clothes are ready!"\n\nThe Emperor himself, with his grandest courtiers, went to put on his\nnew suit. 183\n\n"See!" said the rogues, lifting their arms as if holding something.\n"Here are the trousers! Here is the coat! Here is the cape!" and so on.\n"It is as light as a spider\'s web. One might think one had nothing on.\nBut that is just the beauty of it!"\n\n"Very nice," said the courtiers. But they could see nothing; for\nthere was nothing!\n\n"Will your Imperial Majesty be graciously pleased to take off your\nclothes," asked the rogues, "so that we may put on the new ones before\nthis long mirror?"\n\nThe Emperor took off all his own clothes, and the two rogues\npretended to put on each new garment as it was ready. They wrapped him\nabout, and they tied and they buttoned. The Emperor turned round and\nround before the mirror.\n\n"How well his Majesty looks in his new clothes!" said the people.\n"How becoming they are! What a pattern! What colors! It is a beautiful\ndress!"\n\n"They are waiting outside with the canopy which is to be carried over\nyour Majesty in the procession," said the master of ceremonies.\n\n"I am ready," said the Emperor. "Don\'t the clothes fit well?" he\nasked, giving a last glance into the mirror as though he were looking at\nall his new finery.\n\nThe men who were to carry the train of the Emperor\'s cloak stooped\ndown to the floor as if picking up the train, and then held it high in\nthe air. They did not dare let it be known that they could see\nnothing.\n\nSo the Emperor marched along under the bright canopy. Everybody in\nthe streets and at the windows cried out: "How beautiful the Emperor\'s\nnew clothes are! What a fine train! And they fit to perfection!"\n\nNo one would let it be known that he could see nothing, for that\nwould have proved that he was unfit for office or that he was very, very\nstupid. None of the Emperor\'s clothes had ever been as successful as\nthese.\n\n"But he has nothing on!" said a little child.\n\n"Just listen to the innocent!" said its father.\n\nBut one person whispered to another what the child had said. "He has\nnothing on! A child says he has nothing on!"\n\n"But he has nothing on!" at last cried all the people.\n\nThe Emperor writhed, for he knew that this was true. But he realized\nthat it would never do to stop the procession. So he held himself\nstiffer than ever, and the chamberlains carried the invisible train.\n\n194\n\nIn his story "The Nightingale," Andersen suggests that the so-called\nupper class of society may become so conventionalized as to be unable to\nappreciate true beauty. Poor fishermen and the little kitchen girl in\nthe story recognize the beauty of the exquisite song of the nightingale,\nand Andersen shows his regard for royalty by having the emperor\nappreciate it twice. The last part of the story is especially\nimpressive. When Death approached the emperor and took from him the\nsymbols that had made him rank above his fellows, the emperor saw the\nrealities of life and again perceived the beauty of the nightingale\'s\nsong. This contact with real life made Death shrink away. Then the\nemperor learned Andersen\'s message to artificial society: If you would\nbehold true beauty, you must have it in your own heart.\n\n184\n\nTHE NIGHTINGALE\n\nHANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN\n\nIn China, you must know, the Emperor is a Chinaman, and all whom he\nhas about him are Chinamen too. It happened a good many years ago, but\nthat\'s just why it\'s worth while to hear the story before it is\nforgotten. The Emperor\'s palace was the most splendid in the world; it\nwas made entirely of porcelain, very costly, but so delicate and brittle\nthat one had to take care how one touched it. In the garden were to be\nseen the most wonderful flowers, and to the costliest of them silver\nbells were tied, which sounded, so that nobody should pass by without\nnoticing the flowers. Yes, everything in the Emperor\'s garden was\nadmirably arranged. And it extended so far that the gardener himself did\nnot know where the end was. If a man went on and on, he came into a\nglorious forest with high trees and deep lakes. The wood extended\nstraight down to the sea, which was blue and deep; great ships could\nsail, too, beneath the branches of the trees; and in the trees lived a\nNightingale, which sang so splendidly that even the poor fisherman, who\nhad many other things to do, stopped still and listened, when he had\ngone out at night to throw out his nets, and heard the Nightingale.\n\n"How beautiful that is!" he said; but he was obliged to attend to his\nproperty, and thus forgot the bird. But when the next night the bird\nsang again, and the fisherman heard it, he exclaimed again, "How\nbeautiful that is!"\n\nFrom all the countries of the world travelers came to the city of the\nEmperor, and admired it, and the palace and the garden, but when they\nheard the Nightingale, they said, "That is the best of all!"\n\nAnd the travelers told of it when they came home; and the learnèd men\nwrote many books about the town, the palace, and the garden. But they\ndid not forget the Nightingale; that was placed highest of all; and\nthose who were poets wrote most magnificent poems about the Nightingale\nin the wood by the deep lake.\n\nThe books went through all the world, and a few of them once came to\nthe Emperor. He sat in his golden chair, and read, and read: every\nmoment he nodded his head, for it pleased him to peruse the masterly\ndescriptions of the city, the palace, and the garden. "But the\nNightingale is the best of all," it stood written there.\n\n"What\'s that?" exclaimed the Emperor. "I don\'t know the Nightingale\nat all! Is there such a bird in my empire, and even in my garden? I\'ve\nnever heard of that. To think that I should have to learn such a thing\nfor the first time from books!"\n\nAnd hereupon he called his cavalier. This cavalier was so grand that\nif anyone lower in rank than himself dared to speak to him, or to ask\nhim any question, he answered nothing but "P!"—and that meant\nnothing.\n\n"There is said to be a wonderful bird here called a Nightingale,"\nsaid the Emperor. "They say it is the best thing in all my great empire.\nWhy have I never heard anything about it?"\n\n"I have never heard him named," replied the cavalier. "He has never\nbeen introduced at Court."\n\n"I command that he shall appear this evening, and sing before me,"\nsaid the Emperor. "All the world knows what I possess, and I do not know\nit myself!"\n\n"I have never heard him mentioned," said the cavalier. "I will seek\nfor him. I will find him."\n\nBut where was he to be found? The cavalier ran up and down all the\nstaircases, through halls and passages, but no one among all those whom\nhe met had heard talk of the Nightingale. And the cavalier ran back to\nthe Emperor, and said that it must be a fable invented by the writers of\nbooks.\n\n"Your Imperial Majesty cannot believe how much is written that is\nfiction, besides something that they call the black art."\n\n"But the book in which I read this," said the Emperor, "was sent to\nme by the high and mighty Emperor of Japan and therefore it cannot be a\nfalsehood. I will hear the Nightingale! It must be here this\nevening! It has my imperial favor; and if it does not come, all the\nCourt shall be trampled upon after the Court has supped!"\n\n"Tsing-pe!" said the cavalier; and again he ran up and down all the\nstaircases, and through all the halls and corridors; and half the Court\nran with him, for the courtiers did not like being trampled upon.\n\nThen there was a great inquiry after the wonderful Nightingale, which\nall the world knew excepting the people at Court.\n\nAt last they met with a poor little girl in the kitchen, who\nsaid:\n\n"The Nightingale? I know it well; yes, it can sing gloriously. Every\nevening I get leave to carry my poor sick mother the scraps from the\ntable. She lives down by the strand; and when I get back and am tired,\nand rest in the wood, then I hear the Nightingale sing. And then the\nwater comes into my eyes, and it is just as if my mother kissed me."\n\n"Little kitchen girl," said the cavalier, "I will get you a place in\nthe Court kitchen, with permission to see the Emperor dine, if you will\nbut lead us to the Nightingale, for it is announced for this\nevening."\n\nSo they all went out into the wood where the Nightingale was\naccustomed to sing; half the Court went forth. When they were in the\nmidst of their journey a cow began to low.\n\n"Oh!" cried the Court pages, "now we have it! That shows a wonderful\npower in so small a creature! I have certainly heard it before."\n\n"No, those are cows lowing," said the little kitchen girl. "We are a\nlong way from the place yet."\n\nNow the frogs began to croak in the marsh.\n\n"Glorious!" said the Chinese Court preacher. "Now I hear it—it sounds\njust like little church bells."\n\n"No, those are frogs," said the little kitchen maid. "But now I think\nwe shall soon hear it."\n\nAnd then the Nightingale began to sing.\n\n"That is it!" exclaimed the little girl. "Listen, listen! and yonder\nit sits."\n\nAnd she pointed to a little gray bird up in the boughs.\n\n"Is it possible?" cried the cavalier. "I should never have thought it\nlooked like that! How simple it looks! It must certainly have lost its\ncolor at seeing such grand people around."\n\n"Little Nightingale!" called the little kitchen maid, quite loudly,\n"our gracious Emperor wishes you to sing before him."\n\n"With the greatest pleasure!" replied the Nightingale, and began to\nsing most delightfully.\n\n"It sounds just like glass bells!" said the cavalier. "And look at\nits little throat, how it\'s working! It\'s wonderful that we should never\nhave heard it before. That bird will be a great success at Court."\n\n"Shall I sing once more before the Emperor?" inquired the\nNightingale, for it thought the Emperor was present.\n\n"My excellent little Nightingale," said the cavalier, "I have great\npleasure in inviting you to a Court festival this evening, when you\nshall charm his Imperial Majesty with your beautiful singing."\n\n"My song sounds best in the green wood," replied the Nightingale;\nstill it came willingly when it heard what the Emperor wished.\n\nThe palace was festively adorned. The walls and the flooring, which\nwere of porcelain, gleamed in the rays of thousands of golden lamps. The\nmost glorious flowers, which could ring clearly, had been placed in the\npassages. There was a running to and fro, and a thorough draught, and\nall the bells rang so loudly that one could not hear one\'s self\nspeak.\n\nIn the midst of the great hall, where the Emperor sat, a golden perch\nhad been placed, on which the Nightingale was to sit. The whole Court\nwas there, and the little cook-maid had got leave to stand behind the\ndoor, as she had now received the title of a real Court cook. All were\nin full dress, and all looked at the little gray bird, to which the\nEmperor nodded.\n\nAnd the Nightingale sang so gloriously that the tears came into the\nEmperor\'s eyes, and the tears ran down over his cheeks; then the\nNightingale sang still more sweetly, that went straight to the heart.\nThe Emperor was so much pleased that he said the Nightingale should have\nhis golden slipper to wear round its neck. But the Nightingale declined\nthis with thanks, saying it had already received a sufficient\nreward.\n\n"I have seen tears in the Emperor\'s eyes—that is the real treasure to\nme. An Emperor\'s tears have a peculiar power. I am rewarded enough!" And\nthen it sang again with a sweet, glorious voice.\n\n"That\'s the most amiable coquetry I ever saw!" said the ladies who\nstood round about, and then they took water in their mouths to gurgle\nwhen anyone spoke to them. They thought they should be nightingales too.\nAnd the lackeys and chambermaids reported that they were satisfied also;\nand that was saying a good deal, for they are the most difficult to\nplease. In short, the Nightingale achieved a real success.\n\nIt was now to remain at Court, to have its own cage, with liberty to\ngo out twice every day and once at night. Twelve servants were appointed\nwhen the Nightingale went out, each of whom had a silken string fastened\nto the bird\'s legs, which they held very tight. There was really no\npleasure in an excursion of that kind.\n\nThe whole city spoke of the wonderful bird, and whenever two people\nmet, one said nothing but "Nightin," and the other said "gale"; and then\nthey both sighed, and understood one another. Eleven pedlars\' children\nwere named after the bird, but not one of them could sing a note.\n\nOne day the Emperor received a large parcel, on which was written,\n"The Nightingale."\n\n"There we have a new book about this celebrated bird," said the\nEmperor. 187\n\nBut it was not a book, but a little work of art, contained in a\nbox—an artificial nightingale, which was to sing like a natural one, and\nwas brilliantly ornamented with diamonds, sapphires, and rubies. So soon\nas the artificial bird was wound up, he could sing one of the pieces\nthat he really sang, and then his tail moved up and down, and shone with\nsilver and gold. Round his neck hung a little ribbon, and on that was\nwritten, "The Emperor of China\'s nightingale is poor compared to that of\nthe Emperor of Japan."\n\n"That is capital!" said they all, and he who had brought the\nartificial bird immediately received the title, Imperial\nHead-Nightingale-Bringer.\n\n"Now they must sing together; what a duet that will be!" cried the\ncourtiers.\n\nAnd so they had to sing together; but it did not sound very well, for\nthe real Nightingale sang its own way, and the artificial bird sang\nwaltzes.\n\n"That\'s not his fault," said the playmaster; "he\'s quite perfect, and\nvery much in my style."\n\nNow the artificial bird was to sing alone. It had just as much\nsuccess as the real one, and then it was much handsomer to look at—it\nshone like bracelets and breastpins.\n\nThree and thirty times over did it sing the same piece, and yet was\nnot tired. The people would gladly have heard it again, but the Emperor\nsaid that the living Nightingale ought to sing something now. But where\nwas it? No one had noticed that it had flown away out of the open\nwindow, back to the green wood.\n\n"But what has become of that?" asked the Emperor.\n\nAnd all the courtiers abused the Nightingale, and declared that it\nwas a very ungrateful creature.\n\n"We have the best bird after all," said they.\n\nAnd so the artificial bird had to sing again, and that was the\nthirty-fourth time that they listened to the same piece. For all that\nthey did not know it quite by heart, for it was so very difficult. And\nthe playmaster praised the bird particularly; yes, he declared that it\nwas better than a nightingale, not only with regard to its plumage and\nthe many beautiful diamonds, but inside as well.\n\n"For you see, ladies and gentlemen, and above all, your Imperial\nMajesty, with a real nightingale one can never calculate what is coming,\nbut in this artificial bird, everything is settled. One can explain it;\none can open it and make people understand where the waltzes come from,\nhow they go, and how one follows up another."\n\n"Those are quite our own ideas," they all said.\n\nAnd the speaker received permission to show the bird to the people on\nthe next Sunday. The people were to hear it sing too, the Emperor\ncommanded: and they did hear it, and were as much pleased as if they had\nall got tipsy upon tea, for that\'s quite the Chinese fashion, and they\nall said, "Oh!" and held up their forefingers and nodded. But the poor\nfisherman, who had heard the real Nightingale, said:\n\n"It sounds pretty enough, and the melodies resemble each other, but\nthere\'s something wanting, though I know not what!"\n\nThe real Nightingale was banished from the country and empire. The\nartificial bird had its place on a silken 188 cushion close to the Emperor\'s\nbed; all the presents it had received, gold and precious stones, were\nranged about it; in title it had advanced to be the High Imperial\nAfter-Dinner-Singer, and in rank to Number One on the left hand; for the\nEmperor considered that side the most important on which the heart is\nplaced, and even in an Emperor the heart is on the left side; and the\nplaymaster wrote a work of five and twenty volumes about the artificial\nbird; it was very learnèd and very long, full of the most difficult\nChinese words; but yet all the people declared that they had read it and\nunderstood it, for fear of being considered stupid, and having their\nbodies trampled on.\n\nSo a whole year went by. The Emperor, the Court, and all the other\nChinese knew every little twitter in the artificial bird\'s song by\nheart. But just for that reason it pleased them best—they could sing\nwith it themselves, and they did so. The street boys sang,\n"Tsi-tsi-tsi-glug-glug!" and the Emperor himself sang it too. Yes, that\nwas certainly famous.\n\nBut one evening, when the artificial bird was singing its best, and\nthe Emperor lay in bed listening to it, something inside the bird said,\n"Whizz!" Something cracked. "Whir-r-r!" All the wheels ran round, and\nthen the music stopped.\n\nThe Emperor immediately sprang out of bed, and caused his body\nphysician to be called; but what could he do? Then they sent\nfor a watchmaker, and after a good deal of talking and investigation,\nthe bird was put into something like order, but the watchmaker said that\nthe bird must be carefully treated, for the barrels were worn, and it\nwould be impossible to put new ones in in such a manner that the music\nwould go. There was a great lamentation; only once in the year was it\npermitted to let the bird sing, and that was almost too much. But then\nthe playmaster made a little speech full of heavy words, and said this\nwas just as good as before—and so of course it was as good as\nbefore.\n\nNow five years had gone by, and a real grief came upon the whole\nnation. The Chinese were really fond of their Emperor, and now he was\nill, and could not, it was said, live much longer. Already a new Emperor\nhad been chosen, and the people stood out in the street and asked the\ncavalier how the Emperor did.\n\n"P!" said he, and shook his head.\n\nCold and pale lay the Emperor in his great, gorgeous bed; the whole\nCourt thought him dead, and each one ran to pay homage to the new ruler.\nThe chamberlains ran out to talk it over, and the ladies\' maids had a\ngreat coffee party. All about, in all the halls and passages, cloth had\nbeen laid down so that no footstep could be heard, and therefore it was\nquiet there, quite quiet. But the Emperor was not dead yet; stiff and\npale he lay on the gorgeous bed, with the long velvet curtains and the\nheavy gold tassels; high up, a window stood open, and the moon shone in\nupon the Emperor and the artificial bird.\n\nThe poor Emperor could scarcely breathe; it was just as if something\nlay upon his chest; he opened his eyes, and then he saw that it was\nDeath who sat upon his chest, and had put on his golden crown, and held\nin one hand the Emperor\'s sword, in the other his beautiful banner. And\nall around, from among the folds of the splendid velvet curtains,\nstrange heads peered forth; a few very 189 ugly, the rest quite lovely and\nmild. These were all the Emperor\'s bad and good deeds, that stood before\nhim now that Death sat upon his heart.\n\n"Do you remember this?" whispered one to the other. "Do you remember\nthat?" and then they told him so much that the perspiration ran from his\nforehead.\n\n"I did not know that!" said the Emperor. "Music! music! the great\nChinese drum!" he cried, "so that I need not hear all they say!"\n\nAnd they continued speaking, and Death nodded like a Chinaman to all\nthey said.\n\n"Music! music!" cried the Emperor. "You little precious golden bird,\nsing, sing! I have given you gold and costly presents; I have even hung\nmy golden slipper around your neck—sing now, sing!"\n\nBut the bird stood still; no one was there to wind him up, and he\ncould not sing without that; but Death continued to stare at the Emperor\nwith his great, hollow eyes, and it was quiet, fearfully quiet.\n\nThen there sounded from the window, suddenly, the most lovely song.\nIt was the little live Nightingale, that sat outside on a spray. It had\nheard of the Emperor\'s sad plight, and had come to sing to him of\ncomfort and hope. As it sang the specters grew paler and paler; the\nblood ran quicker and more quickly through the Emperor\'s weak limbs; and\neven Death listened, and said:\n\n"Go on, little Nightingale, go on!"\n\n"But will you give me that splendid golden sword? Will you give me\nthat rich banner? Will you give me the Emperor\'s crown?"\n\nAnd Death gave up each of these treasures for a song. And the\nNightingale sang on and on; and it sang of the quiet churchyard where\nthe white roses grow, where the elder blossoms smell sweet, and where\nthe fresh grass is moistened by the tears of survivors. Then Death felt\na longing to see his garden, and floated out at the window in the form\nof a cold white mist.\n\n"Thanks! thanks!" said the Emperor. "You heavenly little bird; I know\nyou well. I banished you from my country and empire, and yet you have\ncharmed away the evil faces from my couch, and banished Death from my\nheart! How can I reward you?"\n\n"You have rewarded me!" replied the Nightingale. "I have drawn tears\nfrom your eyes, when I sang the first time—I shall never forget that.\nThose are the jewels that rejoice a singer\'s heart. But now sleep, and\ngrow fresh and strong again. I will sing you something."\n\nAnd it sang, and the Emperor fell into a sweet slumber. Ah! how mild\nand refreshing that sleep was! The sun shone upon him through the\nwindows when he awoke refreshed and restored: not one of his servants\nhad yet returned, for they all thought he was dead; only the Nightingale\nstill sat beside him and sang.\n\n"You must always stay with me," said the Emperor. "You shall sing as\nyou please; and I\'ll break the artificial bird into a thousand\npieces."\n\n"Not so," replied the Nightingale. "It did well as long as it could;\nkeep it as you have done till now. I cannot build my nest in the palace\nto dwell in it, but let me come when I feel the wish; then I will sit in\nthe evening on the spray yonder by the window, and sing you something,\nso that you may be glad and thoughtful at once. I will sing of those who\nare happy and of those who suffer. 190 I will sing of good and of evil\nthat remains hidden round about you. The little singing bird flies far\naround, to the poor fisherman, to the peasant\'s roof, to everyone who\ndwells far away from you and from your Court. I love your heart more\nthan your crown, and yet the crown has an air of sanctity about it. I\nwill come and sing to you—but one thing you must promise me."\n\n"Every thing!" said the Emperor; and he stood there in his imperial\nrobes, which he had put on himself, and pressed the sword which was\nheavy with gold to his heart.\n\n"One thing I beg of you: tell no one that you have a little bird who\ntells you everything. Then it will go all the better."\n\nAnd the Nightingale flew away.\n\nThe servants came in to look at their dead Emperor, and—yes, there he\nstood, and the Emperor said, "Good-morning!"\n\n195\n\nThis story is a favorite for the Christmas season. It is loosely\nconstructed, and rambles along for some time after it might have been\nexpected to finish. Such rambling is often very attractive to childish\nlisteners, as it allows the introduction of unexpected incidents. Miss\nKready has some interesting suggestions about dramatizing this story in\nher Study of Fairy Tales, pp. 151-153. The translation is\nDulcken\'s.\n\nTHE FIR TREE\n\nHANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN\n\nOut in the forest stood a pretty little Fir Tree. It had a good\nplace; it could have sunlight, air there was in plenty, and all around\ngrew many larger comrades—pines as well as firs. But the little Fir Tree\nwished ardently to become greater. It did not care for the warm sun and\nthe fresh air; it took no notice of the peasant children, who went about\ntalking together, when they had come out to look for strawberries and\nraspberries. Often they came with a whole pot-full, or had strung\nberries on a straw; then they would sit down by the little Fir Tree and\nsay, "How pretty and small that one is!" and the Fir Tree did not like\nto hear that at all.\n\nNext year he had grown a great joint, and the following year he was\nlonger still, for in fir trees one can always tell by the number of\nrings they have how many years they have been growing.\n\n"Oh, if I were only as great a tree as the other!" sighed the little\nFir, "then I would spread my branches far around, and look out from my\ncrown into the wide world. The birds would then build nests in my\nboughs, and when the wind blew I could nod just as grandly as the others\nyonder."\n\nIt took no pleasure in the sunshine, in the birds, and in the red\nclouds that went sailing over him morning and evening.\n\nWhen it was winter, and the snow lay all around, white and sparkling,\na hare would often come jumping along, and spring right over the little\nFir Tree. Oh! this made him so angry. But two winters went by, and when\nthe third came the little Tree had grown so tall that the hare was\nobliged to run round it.\n\n"Oh! to grow, to grow, and become old; that\'s the only fine thing in\nthe world," thought the Tree.\n\nIn the autumn woodcutters always came and felled a few of the largest\ntrees; that was done this year too, and the little Fir Tree, that was\nnow quite well grown, shuddered with fear, for the 191 great\nstately trees fell to the ground with a crash, and their branches were\ncut off, so that the trees looked quite naked, long, and slender—they\ncould hardly be recognized. But then they were laid upon wagons, and\nhorses dragged them away out of the wood. Where were they going? What\ndestiny awaited them?\n\nIn the spring, when the Swallows and the Stork came, the Tree asked\nthem, "Do you know where they were taken? Did you not meet them?"\n\nThe Swallows knew nothing about it, but the Stork looked thoughtful,\nnodded his head, and said:\n\n"Yes, I think so. I met many new ships when I flew out of Egypt; on\nthe ships were stately masts; I fancy these were the trees. They smelt\nlike fir. I can assure you they\'re stately—very stately."\n\n"Oh that I were only big enough to go over the sea! What kind of\nthing is this sea, and how does it look?"\n\n"It would take too long to explain all that," said the Stork, and he\nwent away.\n\n"Rejoice in thy youth," said the Sunbeams; "rejoice in thy fresh\ngrowth, and in the young life that is within thee."\n\nAnd the wind kissed the Tree, and the dew wept tears upon it; but the\nFir Tree did not understand that.\n\nWhen Christmas-time approached, quite young trees were felled,\nsometimes trees which were neither so old nor so large as this Fir Tree,\nthat never rested, but always wanted to go away. These young trees,\nwhich were always the most beautiful, kept all their branches; they were\nput upon wagons, and horses dragged them away out of the wood.\n\n"Where are they all going?" asked the Fir Tree. "They are not greater\nthan I—indeed, one of them was much smaller. Why do they keep all their\nbranches? Whither are they taken?"\n\n"We know that! We know that!" chirped the Sparrows. "Yonder in the\ntown we looked in at the windows. We know where they go. Oh! they are\ndressed up in the greatest pomp and splendor that can be imagined. We\nhave looked in at the windows, and have perceived that they are planted\nin the middle of a warm room, and adorned with the most beautiful\nthings—gilt apples, honey-cakes, playthings, and many hundred\ncandles."\n\n"And then?" asked the Fir Tree, and trembled through all its\nbranches. "And then? What happens then?"\n\n"Why, we have not seen anything more. But it was incomparable."\n\n"Perhaps I may be destined to tread this glorious path one day!"\ncried the Fir Tree, rejoicingly. "That is even better than traveling\nacross the sea. How painfully I long for it! If it were only Christmas\nnow! Now I am great and grown up, like the rest who were led away last\nyear. Oh, if I were only on the carriage! If I were only in the warm\nroom, among all the pomp and splendor! And then? Yes, then something\neven better will come, something far more charming, or else why should\nthey adorn me so? There must be something grander, something greater\nstill to come; but what? Oh! I\'m suffering, I\'m longing! I don\'t know\nmyself what is the matter with me!"\n\n"Rejoice in us," said Air and Sunshine. "Rejoice in thy fresh youth\nhere in the woodland."\n\nBut the Fir Tree did not rejoice at all, but it grew and grew; winter\nand summer it stood there, green, dark green. The 192 people\nwho saw it said, "That\'s a handsome tree!" and at Christmas time it was\nfelled before any one of the others. The ax cut deep into its marrow,\nand the tree fell to the ground with a sigh; it felt a pain, a sensation\nof faintness, and could not think at all of happiness, for it was sad at\nparting from its home, from the place where it had grown up; it knew\nthat it should never again see the dear old companions, the little\nbushes and flowers all around—perhaps not even the birds. The parting\nwas not at all agreeable.\n\nThe Tree only came to itself when it was unloaded in a yard, with\nother trees, and heard a man say:\n\n"This one is famous; we want only this one!"\n\nNow two servants came in gay liveries, and carried the Fir Tree into\na large, beautiful saloon. All around the walls hung pictures, and by\nthe great stove stood large Chinese vases with lions on the covers;\nthere were rocking-chairs, silken sofas, great tables covered with\npicture books, and toys worth a hundred times a hundred dollars, at\nleast the children said so. And the Fir Tree was put into a great tub\nfilled with sand; but no one could see that it was a tub, for it was\nhung round with green cloth, and stood on a large, many-colored carpet.\nOh, how the Tree trembled! What was to happen now? The servants, and the\nyoung ladies also, decked it out. On one branch they hung little nets,\ncut out of colored paper; every net was filled with sweetmeats; golden\napples and walnuts hung down, as if they grew there, and more than a\nhundred little candles, red, white, and blue, were fastened to the\ndifferent boughs. Dolls that looked exactly like real people—the tree\nhad never seen such before—swung among the foliage, and high on the\nsummit of the Tree was fixed a tinsel star. It was splendid,\nparticularly splendid.\n\n"This evening," said all, "this evening it will shine."\n\n"Oh," thought the Tree, "that it were evening already! Oh, that the\nlights may be soon lit up! When may that be done? I wonder if trees will\ncome out of the forest to look at me? Will the sparrows fly against the\npanes? Shall I grow fast here, and stand adorned in summer and\nwinter?"\n\nYes, he did not guess badly. But he had a complete backache from mere\nlonging, and the backache is just as bad for a Tree as the headache for\na person.\n\nAt last the candles were lighted. What a brilliance, what splendor!\nThe Tree trembled so in all its branches that one of the candles set\nfire to a green twig, and it was scorched.\n\n"Heaven preserve us!" cried the young ladies; and they hastily put\nthe fire out.\n\nNow the Tree might not even tremble. Oh, that was terrible! It was so\nafraid of setting fire to some of its ornaments, and it was quite\nbewildered with all the brilliance. And now the folding doors were\nthrown open, and a number of children rushed in as if they would have\noverturned the whole Tree; the older people followed more deliberately.\nThe little ones stood quite silent, but only for a minute; then they\nshouted till the room rang: they danced gleefully round the Tree, and\none present after another was plucked from it.\n\n"What are they about?" thought the Tree. "What\'s going to be\ndone?"\n\nAnd the candles burned down to the twigs, and as they burned down\nthey 193 were extinguished, and then the children received\npermission to plunder the Tree. Oh! they rushed in upon it, so that\nevery branch cracked again: if it had not been fastened by the top and\nby the golden star to the ceiling, it would have fallen down.\n\nThe children danced about with their pretty toys. No one looked at\nthe Tree except one old man, who came up and peeped among the branches,\nbut only to see if a fig or an apple had not been forgotten.\n\n"A story! A story!" shouted the children; and they drew a little fat\nman toward the tree; and he sat down just beneath it—"for then we shall\nbe in the green wood," said he, "and the tree may have the advantage of\nlistening to my tale. But I can only tell one. Will you hear the story\nof Ivede-Avede, or of Klumpey-Dumpey, who fell downstairs, and still was\nraised up to honor and married the Princess?"\n\n"Ivede-Avede!" cried some, "Klumpey-Dumpey!" cried others, and there\nwas a great crying and shouting. Only the Fir Tree was quite silent, and\nthought, "Shall I not be in it? Shall I have nothing to do in it?" But\nhe had been in the evening\'s amusement, and had done what was required\nof him.\n\nAnd the fat man told about Klumpey-Dumpey who fell downstairs, and\nyet was raised to honor and married the Princess. And the children\nclapped their hands, and cried, "Tell another! tell another!" for they\nwanted to hear about Ivede-Avede; but they only got the story of\nKlumpey-Dumpey. The Fir Tree stood quite silent and thoughtful; never\nhad the birds in the wood told such a story as that. Klumpey-Dumpey fell\ndownstairs, and yet came to honor and married the Princess!\n\n"Yes, so it happens in the world!" thought the Fir Tree, and believed\nit must be true, because that was such a nice man who told it. "Well,\nwho can know? Perhaps I shall fall downstairs, too, and marry a\nPrincess!" And it looked forward with pleasure to being adorned again,\nthe next evening, with candles and toys, gold and fruit. "To-morrow I\nshall not tremble," it thought.\n\n"I will rejoice in all my splendor. To-morrow I shall hear the story\nof Klumpey-Dumpey again, and perhaps that of Ivede-Avede, too."\n\nAnd the Tree stood all night quiet and thoughtful.\n\nIn the morning the servants and the chambermaid came in.\n\n"Now my splendor will begin afresh," thought the Tree. But they\ndragged him out of the room, and upstairs to the garret, and here they\nput him in a dark corner where no daylight shone.\n\n"What\'s the meaning of this?" thought the Tree. "What am I to do\nhere? What is to happen?"\n\nAnd he leaned against the wall, and thought, and thought. And he had\ntime enough, for days and nights went by, and nobody came up; and when\nat length someone came, it was only to put some great boxes in a corner.\nNow the Tree stood quite hidden away, and the supposition is that it was\nquite forgotten.\n\n"Now it\'s winter outside," thought the Tree. "The earth is hard and\ncovered with snow, and people cannot plant me; therefore I suppose I\'m\nto be sheltered here until spring comes. How considerate that is! How\ngood people are! If it were only not so dark 194 here,\nand so terribly solitary!—not even a little hare? That was pretty out\nthere in the wood, when the snow lay thick and the hare sprang past;\nyes, even when he jumped over me; but then I did not like it. It is\nterribly lonely up here!"\n\n"Piep! piep!" said a little Mouse, and crept forward, and then came\nanother little one. They smelt at the Fir Tree, and then slipped among\nthe branches.\n\n"It\'s horribly cold," said the two little Mice, "or else it would be\ncomfortable here. Don\'t you think so, you old Fir Tree?"\n\n"I\'m not old at all," said the Fir Tree. "There are many much older\nthan I."\n\n"Where do you come from?" asked the Mice. "And what do you know?"\nThey were dreadfully inquisitive. "Tell us about the most beautiful spot\non earth. Have you been there? Have you been in the store room, where\ncheeses lie on the shelves, and hams hang from the ceiling, where one\ndances on tallow candles, and goes in thin and comes out fat?"\n\n"I don\'t know that," replied the Tree; "but I know the wood, where\nthe sun shines and the birds sing."\n\nAnd then it told all about its youth.\n\nAnd the little Mice had never heard anything of the kind; and they\nlistened and said:\n\n"What a number of things you have seen! How happy you must have\nbeen!"\n\n"I?" replied the Fir Tree; and it thought about what it had told.\n"Yes, those were really quite happy times." But then he told of the\nChristmas Eve, when he had been hung with sweetmeats and candles.\n\n"Oh!" said the little Mice, "how happy you have been, you old Fir\nTree!"\n\n"I\'m not old at all," said the Tree. "I only came out of the wood\nthis winter. I\'m only rather backward in my growth."\n\n"What splendid stories you can tell!" said the little Mice.\n\nAnd next night they came with four other little Mice, to hear what\nthe Tree had to relate; and the more it said, the more clearly did it\nremember everything, and thought, "Those were quite merry days! But they\nmay come again. Klumpey-Dumpey fell downstairs, and yet he married the\nPrincess. Perhaps I may marry a Princess too!" And the Fir Tree thought\nof a pretty little Birch Tree that grew out in the forest; for the Fir\nTree, that Birch was a real Princess.\n\n"Who\'s Klumpey-Dumpey?" asked the little Mice.\n\nAnd then the Fir Tree told the whole story. It could remember every\nsingle word; and the little Mice were ready to leap to the very top of\nthe tree with pleasure. Next night a great many more Mice came, and on\nSunday two Rats even appeared; but these thought the story was not\npretty, and the little Mice were sorry for that, for now they also did\nnot like it so much as before.\n\n"Do you only know one story?" asked the Rats.\n\n"Only that one," replied the Tree. "I heard that on the happiest\nevening of my life; I did not think then how happy I was."\n\n"That\'s a very miserable story. Don\'t you know any about bacon and\ntallow candles—a store-room story?"\n\n"No," said the Tree.\n\n"Then we\'d rather not hear you," said the Rats.\n\nAnd they went back to their own people. The little Mice at last\nstayed 195 away also; and then the Tree sighed and said:\n\n"It was very nice when they sat round me, the merry little Mice, and\nlistened when I spoke to them. Now that\'s past too. But I shall remember\nto be pleased when they take me out."\n\nBut when did that happen? Why, it was one morning that people came\nand rummaged in the garret: the boxes were put away, and the Tree\nbrought out; they certainly threw him rather roughly on the floor, but a\nservant dragged him away at once to the stairs, where the daylight\nshone.\n\n"Now life is beginning again!" thought the Tree.\n\nIt felt the fresh air and the first sunbeams, and now it was out in\nthe courtyard. Everything passed so quickly that the Tree quite forgot\nto look at itself, there was so much to look at all round. The courtyard\nwas close to a garden, and here everything was blooming; the roses hung\nfresh and fragrant over the little paling, the linden trees were in\nblossom, and the swallows cried, "Quinze-wit! quinze-wit! my husband\'s\ncome!" But it was not the Fir Tree that they meant.\n\n"Now I shall live!" said the Tree, rejoicingly, and spread its\nbranches far out; but, alas! they were all withered and yellow; and it\nlay in the corner among nettles and weeds. The tinsel star was still\nupon it, and shone in the bright sunshine.\n\nIn the courtyard a couple of the merry children were playing who had\ndanced round the tree at Christmas time, and had rejoiced over it. One\nof the youngest ran up and tore off the golden star.\n\n"Look what is sticking to the ugly old fir tree!" said the child, and\nhe trod upon the branches till they cracked again under his boots.\n\nAnd the Tree looked at all the blooming flowers and the splendor of\nthe garden, and then looked at itself, and wished it had remained in the\ndark corner of the garret; it thought of its fresh youth in the wood, of\nthe merry Christmas Eve, and of the little Mice which had listened so\npleasantly to the story of Klumpey-Dumpey.\n\n"Past! past!" said the old Tree. "Had I but rejoiced when I could\nhave done so! Past! past!"\n\nAnd the servant came and chopped the Tree into little pieces; a whole\nbundle lay there; it blazed brightly under the great brewing copper, and\nit sighed deeply, and each sigh was like a little shot; and the children\nwho were at play there ran up and seated themselves at the fire, looked\ninto it, and cried "Puff! puff!" But at each explosion, which was a deep\nsigh, the Tree thought of a summer day in the woods, or of a winter\nnight there, when the stars beamed; he thought of Christmas Eve and of\nKlumpey-Dumpey, the only story he had ever heard or knew how to tell;\nand then the Tree was burned.\n\nThe boys played in the garden, and the youngest had on his breast a\ngolden star, which the Tree had worn on its happiest evening. Now that\nwas past, and the Tree\'s life was past, and the story is past too: past!\npast!—and that\'s the way with all stories.\n\n196\n\nThe tale that follows was one of the author\'s earliest stories,\npublished in 1835. It is clearly based upon an old folk tale, one\nvariant of which is "The Blue Light" from the Grimm collection (No.\n174). "It was 196 a lucky stroke," says Brandes, "that made\nAndersen the poet of children. After long fumbling, after unsuccessful\nefforts, which must necessarily throw a false and ironic light on the\nself-consciousness of a poet whose pride based its justification mainly\non the expectancy of a future which he felt slumbering within his soul,\nafter wandering about for long years, Andersen … one evening found\nhimself in front of a little insignificant yet mysterious door, the door\nof the nursery story. He touched it, it yielded, and he saw, burning in\nthe obscurity within, the little \'Tinder-Box\' that became his Aladdin\'s\nlamp. He struck fire with it, and the spirits of the lamp—the dogs with\neyes as large as tea-cups, as mill-wheels, as the round tower in\nCopenhagen—stood before him and brought him the three giant chests,\ncontaining all the copper, silver, and gold treasure stories of the\nnursery story. The first story had sprung into existence, and the\n\'Tinder-Box\' drew all the others onward in its train. Happy is he who\nhas found his \'tinder-box.\'" The translation is by H. W. Dulcken.\n\nTHE TINDER-BOX\n\nHANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN\n\nThere came a soldier marching along the high road—one, two! one,\ntwo! He had his knapsack on his back and a saber by his side, for\nhe had been in the wars, and now he wanted to go home. And on the way he\nmet with an old witch; she was very hideous, and her under lip hung down\nupon her breast. She said, "Good evening, soldier. What a fine sword you\nhave, and what a big knapsack! You\'re a proper soldier! Now you shall\nhave as much money as you like to have."\n\n"I thank you, you old witch!" said the soldier.\n\n"Do you see that great tree?" quoth the witch; and she pointed to a\ntree which stood beside them. "It\'s quite hollow inside. You must climb\nto the top, and then you\'ll see a hole, through which you can let\nyourself down and get deep into the tree. I\'ll tie a rope round your\nbody, so that I can pull you up again when you call me."\n\n"What am I to do down in the tree?" asked the soldier.\n\n"Get money," replied the witch. "Listen to me. When you come down to\nthe earth under the tree, you will find yourself in a great hall: it is\nquite light, for above three hundred lamps are burning there. Then you\nwill see three doors; those you can open, for the keys are hanging\nthere. If you go into the first chamber, you\'ll see a great chest in the\nmiddle of the floor; on this chest sits a dog, and he\'s got a pair of\neyes as big as two tea-cups. But you need not care for that. I\'ll give\nyou my blue-checked apron, and you can spread it out upon the floor;\nthen go up quickly and take the dog, and set him on my apron; then open\nthe chest, and take as many shillings as you like. They are of copper:\nif you prefer silver, you must go into the second chamber. But there\nsits a dog with a pair of eyes as big as mill-wheels. But do not you\ncare for that. Set him upon my apron, and take some of the money. And if\nyou want gold, you can have that too—in fact, as much as you can\ncarry—if you go into the third chamber. But the dog that sits on the\nmoney-chest there has two eyes as big as round towers. He is a fierce\ndog, you may be sure; but you needn\'t be afraid, for all that. Only set\nhim on my apron, and he won\'t hurt you; and take out of the chest as\nmuch gold as you like."\n\n"That\'s not so bad," said the soldier. "But what am I to give you,\nold witch? for you will not do it for nothing, I fancy."\n\n"No," replied the witch, "not a single shilling will I have. You\nshall only bring me an old tinder-box which my grandmother forgot when\nshe was down there last."\n\n"Then tie the rope round my body," cried the soldier.\n\n"Here it is," said the witch, "and here\'s my blue-checked apron."\n\nThen the soldier climbed up into the tree, let himself slip down into\nthe hole, and stood, as the witch had said, in the great hall where the\nthree hundred lamps were burning.\n\nNow he opened the first door. Ugh! there sat the dog with eyes as big\nas tea-cups, staring at him. "You\'re a nice fellow!" exclaimed the\nsoldier; and he set him on the witch\'s apron, and took as many copper\nshillings as his pockets would hold, and then locked the chest, set the\ndog on it again, and went into the second chamber. Aha! there sat the\ndog with eyes as big as mill-wheels.\n\n"You should not stare so hard at me," said the soldier; "you might\nstrain your eyes." And he set the dog upon the witch\'s apron. And when\nhe saw the silver money in the chest, he threw away all the copper money\nhe had, and filled his pocket and his knapsack with silver only. Then he\nwent into the third chamber. Oh, but that was horrid! The dog there\nreally had eyes as big as towers, and they turned round and round in his\nhead like wheels.\n\n"Good evening!" said the soldier; and he touched his cap, for he had\nnever seen such a dog as that before. When he had looked at him a little\nmore closely, he thought, "That will do," and lifted him down to the\nfloor, and opened the chest. Mercy! what a quantity of gold was there!\nHe could buy with it the whole town, and the sugar sucking-pigs of the\ncake woman, and all the tin soldiers, whips, and rocking-horses in the\nwhole world. Yes, that was a quantity of money! Now the soldier threw\naway all the silver coin with which he had filled his pockets and his\nknapsack, and took gold instead: yes, all his pockets, his knapsack, his\nboots, and his cap were filled, so that he could scarcely walk. Now\nindeed he had plenty of money. He put the dog on the chest, shut the\ndoor, and then called up through the tree, "Now pull me up, you old\nwitch."\n\n"Have you the tinder-box?" asked the witch.\n\n"Plague on it!" exclaimed the soldier, "I had clean forgotten that."\nAnd he went and brought it.\n\nThe witch drew him up, and he stood on the high road again, with\npockets, boots, knapsack, and cap full of gold.\n\n"What are you going to do with the tinder-box?" asked the\nsoldier.\n\n"That\'s nothing to you," retorted the witch. "You\'ve had your\nmoney—just give me the tinder-box."\n\n"Nonsense!" said the soldier. "Tell me directly what you\'re going to\ndo with it, or I\'ll draw my sword and cut off your head."\n\n"No!" cried the witch.\n\nSo the soldier cut off her head. There she lay! But he tied up all\nhis money in her apron, took it on his back like a bundle, put the\ntinder-box in his pocket, and went straight off toward the town.\n\nThat was a splendid town! And he put up at the very best inn and\nasked for the finest rooms, and ordered his 198\nfavorite dishes, for now he was rich, as he had so much money. The\nservant who had to clean his boots certainly thought them a remarkably\nold pair for such a rich gentleman; but he had not bought any new ones\nyet. The next day he procured proper boots and handsome clothes. Now our\nsoldier had become a fine gentleman; and the people told him of all the\nsplendid things which were in their city, and about the King, and what a\npretty Princess the King\'s daughter was.\n\n"Where can one get to see her?" asked the soldier.\n\n"She is not to be seen at all," said they, all together; "she lives\nin a great copper castle, with a great many walls and towers round about\nit; no one but the King may go in and out there, for it has been\nprophesied that she shall marry a common soldier, and the King can\'t\nbear that."\n\n"I should like to see her," thought the soldier; but he could not get\nleave to do so. Now he lived merrily, went to the theater, drove in the\nKing\'s garden, and gave much money to the poor; and this was very kind\nof him, for he knew from old times how hard it is when one has not a\nshilling. Now he was rich, had fine clothes, and gained many friends,\nwho all said he was a rare one, a true cavalier; and that pleased the\nsoldier well. But as he spent money every day and never earned any, he\nhad at last only two shillings left; and he was obliged to turn out of\nthe fine rooms in which he had dwelt, and had to live in a little garret\nunder the roof, and clean his boots for himself, and mend them with a\ndarning-needle. None of his friends came to see him, for there were too\nmany stairs to climb.\n\nIt was quite dark one evening, and he could not even buy himself a\ncandle, when it occurred to him that there was a candle-end in the\ntinder-box which he had taken out of the hollow tree into which the\nwitch had helped him. He brought out the tinder-box and the candle-end;\nbut as soon as he struck fire and the sparks rose up from the flint, the\ndoor flew open, and the dog who had eyes as big as a couple of tea-cups,\nand whom he had seen in the tree, stood before him, and said:\n\n"What are my lord\'s commands?"\n\n"What is this?" said the soldier. "That\'s a famous tinder-box, if I\ncan get everything with it that I want! Bring me some money," said he to\nthe dog: and whisk! the dog was gone, and whisk! he\nwas back again, with a great bag full of shillings in his mouth.\n\nNow the soldier knew what a capital tinder-box this was. If he struck\nit once, the dog came who sat upon the chest of copper money; if he\nstruck it twice, the dog came who had the silver; and if he struck it\nthree times, then appeared the dog who had the gold. Now the soldier\nmoved back into the fine rooms, and appeared again in handsome clothes;\nand all his friends knew him again, and cared very much for him\nindeed.\n\nOnce he thought to himself, "It is a very strange thing that one\ncannot get to see the Princess. They all say she is very beautiful; but\nwhat is the use of that, if she has always to sit in the great copper\ncastle with the many towers? Can I not get to see her at all? Where is\nmy tinder-box?" And so he struck a light, and whisk! came the\ndog with eyes as big as tea-cups.\n\n"It is midnight, certainly," said the soldier, "but I should very\nmuch like 199 to see the Princess, only for one little\nmoment."\n\nAnd the dog was outside the door directly, and, before the soldier\nthought it, came back with the Princess. She sat upon the dog\'s back and\nslept; and everyone could see she was a real Princess, for she was so\nlovely. The soldier could not refrain from kissing her, for he was a\nthorough soldier. Then the dog ran back again with the Princess. But\nwhen morning came, and the King and Queen were drinking tea, the\nPrincess said she had had a strange dream, the night before, about a dog\nand a soldier—that she had ridden upon the dog, and the soldier had\nkissed her.\n\n"That would be a fine history!" said the Queen.\n\nSo one of the old Court ladies had to watch the next night by the\nPrincess\'s bed, to see if this was really a dream, or what it might\nbe.\n\nThe soldier had a great longing to see the lovely Princess again; so\nthe dog came in the night, took her away, and ran as fast as he could.\nBut the old lady put on water-boots, and ran just as fast after him.\nWhen she saw that they both entered a great house, she thought, "Now I\nknow where it is"; and with a bit of chalk she drew a great cross on the\ndoor. Then she went home and lay down, and the dog came up with the\nPrincess; but when he saw that there was a cross drawn on the door where\nthe soldier lived, he took a piece of chalk too, and drew crosses on all\nthe doors in the town. And that was cleverly done, for now the lady\ncould not find the right door, because all the doors had crosses upon\nthem.\n\nIn the morning early came the King and the Queen, the old Court lady\nand all the officers, to see where it was the Princess had been. "Here\nit is!" said the King, when he saw the first door with a cross upon it.\n"No, my dear husband, it is there!" said the Queen, who descried another\ndoor which also showed a cross. "But there is one, and there is one!"\nsaid all, for wherever they looked there were crosses on the doors. So\nthey saw that it would avail them nothing if they searched on.\n\nBut the Queen was an exceedingly clever woman, who could do more than\nride in a coach. She took her great gold scissors, cut a piece of silk\ninto pieces, and made a neat little bag: this bag she filled with fine\nwheat flour, and tied it on the Princess\'s back; and when that was done,\nshe cut a little hole in the bag, so that the flour would be scattered\nalong all the way which the Princess should take.\n\nIn the night the dog came again, took the Princess on his back, and\nran with her to the soldier, who loved her very much, and would gladly\nhave been a prince, so that he might have her for his wife. The dog did\nnot notice at all how the flour ran out in a stream from the castle to\nthe windows of the soldier\'s house, where he ran up the wall with the\nPrincess. In the morning the King and Queen saw well enough where their\ndaughter had been, and they took the soldier and put him in prison.\n\nThere he sat. Oh, but it was dark and disagreeable there! And they\nsaid to him, "To-morrow you shall be hanged." That was not amusing to\nhear, and he had left his tinder-box at the inn. In the morning he could\nsee, through the iron grating of the little window, how the people were\nhurrying out of the town to see him hanged. He heard the 200 drums\nbeat and saw the soldiers marching. All the people were running out, and\namong them was a shoemaker\'s boy with leather apron and slippers, and he\ngalloped so fast that one of his slippers flew off, and came right\nagainst the wall where the soldier sat looking through the iron\ngrating.\n\n"Halloo, you shoemaker\'s boy! you needn\'t be in such a hurry," cried\nthe soldier to him: "it will not begin till I come. But if you will run\nto where I lived, and bring me my tinder-box, you shall have four\nshillings; but you must put your best leg foremost."\n\nThe shoemaker\'s boy wanted to get the four shillings, so he went and\nbrought the tinder-box, and—well, we shall hear now what happened.\n\nOutside the town a great gallows had been built, and around it stood\nthe soldiers and many hundred thousand people. The King and Queen sat on\na splendid throne, opposite to the Judges and the whole Council. The\nsoldier already stood upon the ladder; but as they were about to put the\nrope round his neck, he said that before a poor criminal suffered his\npunishment an innocent request was always granted to him. He wanted very\nmuch to smoke a pipe of tobacco, as it would be the last pipe he should\nsmoke in this world. The King would not say "No" to this; so the soldier\ntook his tinder-box and struck fire. One—two—three—! and there suddenly\nstood all the dogs—the one with eyes as big as tea-cups, the one with\neyes as large as mill-wheels, and the one whose eyes were as big as\nround towers.\n\n"Help me now, so that I may not be hanged," said the soldier. And the\ndogs fell upon the Judge and all the Council, seized one by the leg and\nanother by the nose, and tossed them all many feet into the air, so that\nthey fell down and were all broken to pieces.\n\n"I won\'t!" cried the King; but the biggest dog took him and the Queen\nand threw them after the others. Then the soldiers were afraid, and the\npeople cried, "Little soldier, you shall be our King, and marry the\nbeautiful Princess!"\n\nSo they put the soldier into the King\'s coach, and all the three dogs\ndarted on in front and cried "Hurrah!" and the boys whistled through\ntheir fingers, and the soldiers presented arms. The Princess came out of\nthe copper castle, and became Queen, and she liked that well enough. The\nwedding lasted a week, and the three dogs sat at the table too, and\nopened their eyes wider than ever at all they saw.\n\n197\n\nThe following is one of Andersen\'s early stories, published in 1838.\nIt has always been a great favorite. Whimsically odd couples, in this\ncase so constant in their devotion to each other, seemed to appeal to\nAndersen. The romance of the Whip Top and the Ball in the little story\n"The Lovers" deals with another odd couple. "Constant" or "steadfast"\nare terms sometimes used in the different versions instead of "hardy,"\nand, if they seem better to carry the meaning intended, teachers should\nfeel free to substitute one of them in telling or reading the story. The\ntranslation is by H. W. Dulcken.\n\nTHE HARDY TIN SOLDIER\n\nHANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN\n\nThere were once five-and-twenty tin soldiers; they were all brothers,\nfor they had all been born of one old tin spoon. 201 They\nshouldered their muskets, and looked straight before them; their uniform\nwas red and blue, and very splendid. The first thing they had heard in\nthe world, when the lid was taken off their box, had been the words,\n"Tin soldiers!" These words were uttered by a little boy, clapping his\nhands: the soldiers had been given to him, for it was his birthday; and\nnow he put them upon the table. Each soldier was exactly like the rest;\nbut one of them had been cast last of all, and there had not been enough\ntin to finish him; but he stood as firmly upon his one leg as the others\non their two; and it was just this Soldier who became remarkable.\n\nOn the table on which they had been placed stood many other\nplaythings, but the toy that attracted most attention was a neat castle\nof cardboard. Through the little windows one could see straight into the\nhall. Before the castle some little trees were placed round a little\nlooking-glass, which was to represent a clear lake. Waxen swans swam on\nthis lake, and were mirrored in it. This was all very pretty; but the\nprettiest of all was a little lady, who stood at the open door of the\ncastle; she was also cut out in paper, but she had a dress of the\nclearest gauze, and a little narrow blue ribbon over her shoulders, that\nlooked like a scarf; and in the middle of this ribbon was a shining\ntinsel rose as big as her whole face. The little lady stretched out both\nher arms, for she was a dancer; and then she lifted one leg so high that\nthe Tin Soldier could not see it at all, and thought that, like himself,\nshe had but one leg.\n\n"That would be the wife for me," thought he; "but she is very grand.\nShe lives in a castle, and I have only a box, and there are\nfive-and-twenty of us in that. It is no place for her. But I must try to\nmake acquaintance with her."\n\nAnd then he lay down at full length behind a snuff-box which was on\nthe table; there he could easily watch the little dainty lady, who\ncontinued to stand upon one leg without losing her balance.\n\nWhen the evening came all the other tin soldiers were put into their\nbox, and the people in the house went to bed. Now the toys began to play\nat "visiting," and at "war," and "giving balls." The tin soldiers\nrattled in their box, for they wanted to join, but could not lift the\nlid. The nutcracker threw somersaults, and the pencil amused itself on\nthe table; there was so much noise that the canary woke up, and began to\nspeak too, and even in verse. The only two who did not stir from their\nplaces were the Tin Soldier and the Dancing Lady: she stood straight up\non the point of one of her toes, and stretched out both her arms; and he\nwas just as enduring on his one leg; and he never turned his eyes away\nfrom her.\n\nNow the clock struck twelve—and, bounce! the lid flew off the\nsnuff-box; but there was no snuff in it, but a little black Goblin: you\nsee, it was a trick.\n\n"Tin Soldier!" said the Goblin, "don\'t stare at things that don\'t\nconcern you."\n\nBut the Tin Soldier pretended not to hear him.\n\n"Just you wait till to-morrow!" said the Goblin.\n\nBut when the morning came, and the children got up, the Tin Soldier\nwas placed in the window; and whether it was the Goblin or the draught\nthat did it, all at once the window flew open, 202 and the\nSoldier fell head over heels out of the third story. That was a terrible\npassage! He put his leg straight up, and stuck with helmet downward and\nhis bayonet between the paving-stones.\n\nThe servant-maid and the little boy came down directly to look for\nhim, but though they almost trod upon him, they could not see him. If\nthe Soldier had cried out "Here I am!" they would have found him; but he\ndid not think it fitting to call out loudly, because he was in\nuniform.\n\nNow it began to rain; the drops soon fell thicker, and at last it\ncame down into a complete stream. When the rain was past, two street\nboys came by.\n\n"Just look!" said one of them, "there lies a Tin Soldier. He must\ncome out and ride in the boat."\n\nAnd they made a boat out of a newspaper, and put the Tin Soldier in\nthe middle of it, and so he sailed down the gutter, and the two boys ran\nbeside him and clapped their hands. Goodness preserve us! how the waves\nrose in that gutter, and how fast the stream ran! But then it had been a\nheavy rain. The paper boat rocked up and down, and sometimes turned\nround so rapidly that the Tin Soldier trembled; but he remained firm,\nand never changed countenance, and looked straight before him, and\nshouldered his musket.\n\nAll at once the boat went into a long drain, and it became as dark as\nif he had been in his box.\n\n"Where am I going now?" he thought. "Yes, yes, that\'s the Goblin\'s\nfault. Ah! if the little lady only sat here with me in the boat, it\nmight be twice as dark for what I should care."\n\nSuddenly there came a great Water Rat, which lived under the\ndrain.\n\n"Have you a passport?" said the Rat. "Give me your passport."\n\nBut the Tin Soldier kept silence, and held his musket tighter than\never.\n\nThe boat went on, but the Rat came after it. Hu! how he gnashed his\nteeth, and called out to the bits of straw and wood:\n\n"Hold him! hold him! He hasn\'t paid toll—he hasn\'t shown his\npassport!"\n\nBut the stream became stronger and stronger. The Tin Soldier could\nsee the bright daylight where the arch ended; but he heard a roaring\nnoise which might well frighten a bolder man. Only think—just where the\ntunnel ended, the drain ran into a great canal; and for him that would\nhave been as dangerous as for us to be carried down a great\nwaterfall.\n\nNow he was already so near it that he could not stop. The boat was\ncarried out, the poor Tin Soldier stiffening himself as much as he\ncould, and no one could say that he moved an eyelid. The boat whirled\nround three or four times, and was full of water to the very edge—it\nmust sink. The Tin Soldier stood up to his neck in water, and the boat\nsank deeper and deeper, and the paper was loosened more and more; and\nnow the water closed over the soldier\'s head. Then he thought of the\npretty little Dancer, and how he should never see her again; and it\nsounded in the soldier\'s ears:\n\nFarewell, farewell, thou warrior brave,\n\nFor this day\nthou must die!\n\nTranscriber\'s Note: original reads \'warrier\'\n\nAnd now the paper parted, and the Tin Soldier fell out; but at that\nmoment he was snapped up by a great fish.\n\nOh, how dark it was in that fish\'s body! It was darker yet than in\nthe 203 drain tunnel; and then it was very narrow too.\nBut the Tin Soldier remained unmoved, and lay at full length shouldering\nhis musket.\n\nThe fish swam to and fro; he made the most wonderful movements, and\nthen became quite still. At last something flashed through him like\nlightning. The daylight shone quite clear, and a voice said aloud, "The\nTin Soldier!" The fish had been caught, carried to market, bought, and\ntaken into the kitchen, where the cook cut him open with a large knife.\nShe seized the Soldier round the body with both her hands and carried\nhim into the room, where all were anxious to see the remarkable man who\nhad traveled about in the inside of a fish; but the Tin Soldier was not\nat all proud. They placed him on the table, and there—no! What curious\nthings may happen in the world. The Tin Soldier was in the very room in\nwhich he had been before! He saw the same children, and the same toys\nstood on the table; and there was the pretty castle with the graceful\nlittle Dancer. She was still balancing herself on one leg, and held the\nother extended in the air. She was hardy too. That moved the Tin\nSoldier; he was very nearly weeping tin tears, but that would not have\nbeen proper. He looked at her, but they said nothing to each other.\n\nThen one of the little boys took the Tin Soldier and flung him into\nthe stove. He gave no reason for doing this. It must have been the fault\nof the Goblin in the snuff-box.\n\nThe Tin Soldier stood there quite illuminated, and felt a heat that\nwas terrible; but whether this heat proceeded from the real fire or from\nlove he did not know. The colors had quite gone off from him; but\nwhether that had happened on the journey, or had been caused by grief,\nno one could say. He looked at the little lady, she looked at him, and\nhe felt that he was melting; but he still stood firm, shouldering his\nmusket. Then suddenly the door flew open, and the draught of air caught\nthe Dancer, and she flew like a sylph just into the stove to the Tin\nSoldier, and flashed up in a flame, and she was gone. Then the Tin\nSoldier melted down into a lump; and when the servant-maid took the\nashes out next day, she found him in the shape of a little tin heart.\nBut of the Dancer nothing remained but the tinsel rose, and that was\nburned as black as a coal.\n\n198\n\n"The Ugly Duckling" has always been regarded as one of Andersen\'s\nmost exquisite stories. No one can fail to notice the parallel that\nsuggests itself between the successive stages in the duckling\'s history\nand those in Andersen\'s own life. In this story, remarks Dr. Brandes,\n"there is the quintessence of the author\'s entire life (melancholy,\nhumor, martyrdom, triumph) and of his whole nature: the gift of\nobservation and the sparkling intellect which he used to avenge himself\nupon folly and wickedness, the varied faculties which constitute his\ngenius." The standards of judgment used by the ducks, the turkey, the\nhen, and the cat are all delightfully and humorously satirical of human\nstupidity and shortsightedness. The translation used is by H. W.\nDulcken.\n\nTHE UGLY DUCKLING\n\nHANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN\n\nIt was glorious out in the country. It was summer, and the cornfields\nwere yellow, and the oats were green; the hay 204 had\nbeen put up in stacks in the green meadows, and the stork went about on\nhis long red legs, and chattered Egyptian, for this was the language he\nhad learned from his good mother. All around the fields and meadows were\ngreat forests, and in the midst of these forests lay deep lakes. Yes, it\nwas really glorious out in the country. In the midst of the sunshine\nthere lay an old farm, surrounded by deep canals, and from the wall down\nto the water grew great burdocks, so high that little children could\nstand upright under the loftiest of them. It was just as wild there as\nin the deepest wood. Here sat a Duck upon her nest, for she had to hatch\nher young ones; but she was almost tired out before the little ones\ncame; and then she so seldom had visitors. The other ducks liked better\nto swim about in the canals than to run up to sit down under a burdock\nand cackle with her.\n\nAt last one eggshell after another burst open. "Piep! piep!" it\ncried, and in all the eggs there were little creatures that stuck out\ntheir heads.\n\n"Rap! rap!" they said; and they all came rapping out as fast as they\ncould, looking all round them under the green leaves; and the mother let\nthem look as much as they chose, for green is good for the eyes.\n\n"How wide the world is!" said the young ones, for they certainly had\nmuch more room now than when they were in the eggs.\n\n"Do you think this is all the world!" asked the mother. "That extends\nfar across the other side of the garden, quite into the parson\'s field,\nbut I have never been there yet. I hope you are all together," she\ncontinued, and stood up. "No, I have not all. The largest egg still lies\nthere. How long is that to last? I am really tired of it." And she sat\ndown again.\n\n"Well, how goes it?" asked an old Duck who had come to pay her a\nvisit.\n\n"It lasts a long time with that one egg," said the Duck who sat\nthere. "It will not burst. Now, only look at the others; are they not\nthe prettiest ducks one could possibly see? They are all like their\nfather; the bad fellow never comes to see me."\n\n"Let me see the egg which will not burst," said the old visitor.\n"Believe me, it is a turkey\'s egg. I was once cheated in that way, and\nhad much anxiety and trouble with the young ones, for they are afraid of\nthe water. I could not get them to venture in. I quacked and clucked,\nbut it was of no use. Let me see the egg. Yes, that\'s a turkey\'s egg!\nLet it lie there, and you teach the other children to swim."\n\n"I think I will sit on it a little longer," said the Duck. "I\'ve sat\nso long now that I can sit a few days more."\n\n"Just as you please," said the old Duck; and she went away.\n\nAt last the great egg burst. "Piep! piep!" said the little one, and\ncrept forth. It was very large and very ugly. The Duck looked at it.\n\n"It\'s a very large duckling," said she; "none of the others look like\nthat; can it really be a turkey chick? Now we shall soon find out. It\nmust go into the water, even if I have to thrust it in myself."\n\nThe next day the weather was splendidly bright, and the sun shone on\nall the green trees. The Mother-Duck went down to the water with all her\nlittle ones. Splash! she jumped into the water. "Quack! quack!" she\nsaid, and then one duckling after another plunged in. The 205 water\nclosed over their heads, but they came up in an instant, and swam\ncapitally; their legs went of themselves, and there they were, all in\nthe water. The ugly gray Duckling swam with them.\n\n"No, it\'s not a turkey," said she; "look how well it can use its\nlegs, and how upright it holds itself. It is my own child! On the whole\nit\'s quite pretty, if one looks at it rightly. Quack! quack! come with\nme, and I\'ll lead you out into the great world, and present you in the\npoultry-yard; but keep close to me, so that no one may tread on you; and\ntake care of the cats!"\n\nAnd so they came into the poultry-yard. There was a terrible riot\ngoing on in there, for two families were quarreling about an eel\'s head,\nand the cat got it after all.\n\n"See, that\'s how it goes in the world!" said the Mother-Duck; and she\nwhetted her beak, for she, too, wanted the eel\'s head. "Only use your\nlegs," she said. "See that you bustle about, and bow your heads before\nthe old Duck yonder. She\'s the grandest of all here; she\'s of Spanish\nblood—that\'s why she\'s so fat; and do you see, she has a red rag round\nher leg; that\'s something particularly fine, and the greatest\ndistinction a duck can enjoy; it signifies that one does not want to\nlose her, and that she\'s to be recognized by man and beast. Shake\nyourselves—don\'t turn in your toes; a well-brought-up Duck turns its\ntoes quite out, just like father and mother, so! Now bend your necks and\nsay \'Rap!\'"\n\nAnd they did so; but the other Ducks round about looked at them, and\nsaid quite boldly:\n\n"Look there! now we\'re to have these hanging on, as if there were not\nenough of us already! And—fie—! how that Duckling yonder looks; we won\'t\nstand that!" And one duck flew up immediately, and bit it in the\nneck.\n\n"Let it alone," said the mother; "it does no harm to anyone."\n\n"Yes, but it\'s too large and peculiar," said the Duck who had bitten\nit; "and therefore it must be buffeted."\n\n"Those are pretty children that the mother has there," said the old\nDuck with the rag round her leg. "They\'re all pretty but that one; that\nwas a failure. I wish she could alter it."\n\n"That cannot be done, my lady," replied the Mother-Duck. "It is not\npretty, but it has a really good disposition, and swims as well as any\nother; I may even say it swims better. I think it will grow up pretty,\nand become smaller in time; it has lain too long in the egg, and\ntherefore is not properly shaped." And then she pinched it in the neck,\nand smoothed its feathers. "Moreover, it is a drake," she said, "and\ntherefore it is not of so much consequence. I think he will be very\nstrong; he makes his way already."\n\n"The other ducklings are graceful enough," said the old Duck. "Make\nyourself at home; and if you find an eel\'s head, you may bring it\nme."\n\nAnd now they were at home. But the poor Duckling which had crept last\nout of the egg, and looked so ugly, was bitten and pushed and jeered, as\nmuch by the ducks as by the chickens.\n\n"It is too big!" they all said. And the turkey-cock, who had been\nborn with spurs, and therefore thought himself an Emperor, blew himself\nup like a ship in full sail, and bore straight down upon it; then he\ngobbled, and grew quite red in the face. The poor Duckling did not know\nwhere it should stand or walk; 206 it was quite melancholy,\nbecause it looked ugly and was scoffed at by the whole yard.\n\nSo it went on the first day; and afterward it became worse and worse.\nThe poor Duckling was hunted about by every one; even its brothers and\nsisters were quite angry with it, and said, "If the cat would only catch\nyou, you ugly creature!" And the mother said, "If you were only far\naway!" And the ducks bit it, and the chickens beat it, and the girl who\nhad to feed the poultry kicked at it with her foot.\n\nThen it ran and flew over the fence, and the little birds in the\nbushes flew up in fear.\n\n"That is because I am so ugly!" thought the Duckling; and it shut its\neyes, but flew no farther; thus it came out into the great moor, where\nthe Wild Ducks lived. Here it lay the whole night long; and it was weary\nand downcast.\n\nToward morning the Wild Ducks flew up, and looked at their new\ncompanion.\n\n"What sort of a one are you?" they asked; and the Duckling turned in\nevery direction, and bowed as well as it could. "You are remarkably\nugly!" said the Wild Ducks. "But that is very indifferent to us, so long\nas you do not marry into our family."\n\nPoor thing! It certainly did not think of marrying, and only hoped to\nobtain leave to lie among the reeds and drink some of the\nswamp-water.\n\nThus it lay two whole days; then came thither two Wild Geese, or,\nproperly speaking, two wild ganders. It was not long since each had\ncrept out of an egg, and that\'s why they were so saucy.\n\n"Listen, comrade," said one of them. "You\'re so ugly that I like you.\nWill you go with us, and become a bird of passage? Near here, in another\nmoor, there are a few sweet lovely wild geese, all unmarried, and all\nable to say, \'Rap!\' You\'ve a chance of making your fortune, ugly as you\nare!"\n\n"Piff! paff!" resounded through the air; and the two ganders fell\ndown dead in the swamp, and the water became blood-red. "Piff! paff!" it\nsounded again, and whole flocks of wild geese rose up from the reeds.\nAnd then there was another report. A great hunt was going on. The\nhunters were lying in wait all round the moor, and some were even\nsitting up in the branches of the trees, which spread far over the\nreeds. The blue smoke rose up like clouds among the dark trees, and was\nwafted far away across the water; and the hunting dogs came—splash,\nsplash!—into the swamp, and the rushes and the reeds bent down on every\nside. That was a fright for the poor Duckling! It turned its head, and\nput it under its wing; but at that moment a frightful great dog stood\nclose by the Duckling. His tongue hung far out of his mouth and his eyes\ngleamed horrible and ugly; he thrust out his nose close against the\nDuckling, showed his sharp teeth, and—splash, splash!—on he went without\nseizing it.\n\n"Oh, Heaven be thanked!" sighed the Duckling. "I am so ugly that even\nthe dog does not like to bite me!"\n\nAnd so it lay quite quiet, while the shots rattled through the reeds\nand gun after gun was fired. At last, late in the day, silence was\nrestored; but the poor Duckling did not dare to rise up; it waited\nseveral hours before it looked round, and then hastened away out of the\nmoor as fast as it could. It ran on over field and meadow; there was\nsuch a storm raging that it was difficult to get from one place to\nanother. 207\n\nToward evening the Duck came to a little miserable peasant\'s hut.\nThis hut was so dilapidated that it did not know on which side it should\nfall; and that\'s why it remained standing. The storm whistled round the\nDuckling in such a way that the poor creature was obliged to sit down,\nto stand against it; and the tempest grew worse and worse. Then the\nDuckling noticed that one of the hinges of the door had given way, and\nthe door hung so slanting that the Duckling could slip through the crack\ninto the room; and it did so.\n\nHere lived a woman with her Tom Cat and her Hen. And the Tom Cat,\nwhom she called Sonnie, could arch his back and purr. He could even give\nout sparks; but for that one had to stroke his fur the wrong way. The\nHen had quite little short legs, and therefore she was called\nChickabiddy-shortshanks; she laid good eggs, and the woman loved her as\nher own child.\n\nIn the morning the strange Duckling was at once noticed, and the Tom\nCat began to purr, and the Hen to cluck.\n\n"What\'s this?" said the woman, and looked all round; but she could\nnot see well, and therefore she thought the Duckling was a fat duck that\nhad strayed. "This is a rare prize," she said. "Now I shall have duck\'s\neggs. I hope it is not a drake. We must try that."\n\nAnd so the Duckling was admitted on trial for three weeks; but no\neggs came. And the Tom Cat was master of the house, and the Hen was the\nlady, and they always said, "We and the world!" for they thought they\nwere half the world, and by far the better half. The Duckling thought\none might have a different opinion, but the Hen would not allow it.\n\n"Can you lay eggs?" she asked.\n\n"No."\n\n"Then you\'ll have the goodness to hold your tongue."\n\nAnd the Tom Cat said, "Can you curve your back, and purr, and give\nout sparks?"\n\n"No."\n\n"Then you cannot have any opinion of your own when sensible people\nare speaking."\n\nAnd the Duckling sat in a corner and was melancholy; then the fresh\nair and the sunshine streamed in; and it was seized with such a strange\nlonging to swim on the water that it could not help telling the Hen of\nit.\n\n"What are you thinking of?" cried the Hen. "You have nothing to do;\nthat\'s why you have these fancies. Purr or lay eggs, and they will pass\nover."\n\n"But it is so charming to swim on the water!" said the Duckling, "so\nrefreshing to let it close above one\'s head, and to dive down to the\nbottom."\n\n"Yes, that must be a mighty pleasure, truly," quoth the Hen. "I fancy\nyou must have gone crazy. Ask the Cat about it—he\'s the cleverest animal\nI know—ask him if he likes to swim on the water, or to dive down: I\nwon\'t speak about myself. Ask our mistress, the old woman; no one in the\nworld is cleverer than she. Do you think she has any desire to swim, and\nto let the water close above her head?"\n\n"You don\'t understand me," said the Duckling.\n\n"We don\'t understand you? Then pray who is to understand you? You\nsurely don\'t pretend to be cleverer than the Tom Cat and the old woman—I\nwon\'t say anything of myself. Don\'t be conceited, child, and be grateful\nfor all the kindness you have received. Did 208 you not\nget into a warm room, and have you not fallen into company from which\nyou may learn something? But you are a chatterer, and it is not pleasant\nto associate with you. You may believe me, I speak for your good. I tell\nyou disagreeable things, and by that one may always know one\'s true\nfriends. Only take care that you learn to lay eggs, or to purr and give\nout sparks!"\n\n"I think I will go out into the wide world," said the Duckling.\n\n"Yes, do go," replied the Hen.\n\nAnd the Duckling went away. It swam on the water, and dived, but it\nwas slighted by every creature because of its ugliness.\n\nNow came the autumn. The leaves in the forest turned yellow and\nbrown; the wind caught them so that they danced about, and up in the air\nit was very cold. The clouds hung low, heavy with hail and snow-flakes,\nand on the fence stood the raven, crying, "Croak! croak!" for mere cold;\nyes, it was enough to make one feel cold to think of this. The poor\nlittle Duckling certainly had not a good time. One evening—the sun was\njust setting in his beauty—there came a whole flock of great handsome\nbirds out of the bushes; they were dazzlingly white, with long flexible\nnecks; they were swans. They uttered a very peculiar cry, spread forth\ntheir glorious great wings, and flew away from that cold region to\nwarmer lands, to fair open lakes. They mounted so high, so high! and the\nugly little Duckling felt quite strange as it watched them. It turned\nround and round in the water like a wheel, stretched out its neck toward\nthem, and uttered such a strange loud cry as frightened itself. Oh! it\ncould not forget those beautiful, happy birds; and so soon as it could\nsee them no longer, it dived down to the very bottom, and when it came\nup again, it was quite beside itself. It knew not the name of those\nbirds, and knew not whither they were flying; but it loved them more\nthan it had ever loved anyone. It was not at all envious of them. How\ncould it think of wishing to possess such loveliness as they had? It\nwould have been glad if only the ducks would have endured its\ncompany—the poor ugly creature!\n\nAnd the winter grew cold, very cold! The Duckling was forced to swim\nabout in the water, to prevent the surface from freezing entirely; but\nevery night the hole in which it swam about became smaller and smaller.\nIt froze so hard that the icy covering crackled again; and the Duckling\nwas obliged to use its legs continually to prevent the hole from\nfreezing up. At last it became exhausted, and lay quite still, and thus\nfroze fast into the ice.\n\nEarly in the morning a peasant came by, and when he saw what had\nhappened, he took his wooden shoe, broke the ice-crust to pieces, and\ncarried the Duckling home to his wife. Then it came to itself again. The\nchildren wanted to play with it; but the Duckling thought they would do\nit an injury, and in its terror fluttered up into the milk-pan, so that\nthe milk spurted down into the room. The woman clapped her hands, at\nwhich the Duckling flew down into the butter-tub, and then into the\nmeal-barrel and out again. How it looked then! The woman screamed, and\nstruck at it with the fire-tongs; the children tumbled over one another\nin their efforts to catch the Duckling; and they laughed and screamed\nfinely. Happily the door stood open, and the poor creature was able to\nslip out between the shrubs into the newly- 209fallen\nsnow; and there it lay quite exhausted.\n\nBut it would be too melancholy if I were to tell all the misery and\ncare which the Duckling had to endure in the hard winter. It lay out on\nthe moor among the reeds when the sun began to shine again and the larks\nto sing; it was a beautiful spring.\n\nThen all at once the Duckling could flap its wings; they beat the air\nmore strongly than before, and bore it strongly away; and before it well\nknew how all this had happened, it found itself in a great garden, where\nthe elder trees smelt sweet, and bent their long green branches down to\nthe canal that wound through the region. Oh, here it was so beautiful,\nsuch a gladness of spring! and from the thicket came three glorious\nwhite swans; they rustled their wings, and swam lightly on the water.\nThe Duckling knew the splendid creatures, and felt oppressed by a\npeculiar sadness.\n\n"I will fly away to them, to the royal birds! and they will kill me,\nbecause I, that am so ugly, dare to approach them. But it is of no\nconsequence! Better to be killed by them than to be pursued by\nducks, and beaten by fowls, and pushed about by the girl who takes care\nof the poultry-yard, and to suffer hunger in winter!" And it flew out\ninto the water, and swam toward the beautiful swans: these looked at it,\nand came sailing down upon it with outspread wings. "Kill me!" said the\npoor creature, and bent its head down upon the water, expecting nothing\nbut death. But what was this that it saw in the clear water? It beheld\nits own image—and, lo! it was no longer a clumsy dark-gray bird, ugly\nand hateful to look at, but—a swan.\n\nIt matters nothing if one was born in a duck-yard, if one has only\nlain in a swan\'s egg.\n\nIt felt quite glad at all the need and misfortune it had suffered,\nnow it realized its happiness in all the splendor that surrounded it.\nAnd the great swans swam round it, and stroked it with their beaks.\n\nInto the garden came little children, who threw bread and corn into\nthe water; the youngest cried, "There is a new one!" and the other\nchildren shouted joyously, "Yes, a new one has arrived!" And they\nclapped their hands and danced about, and ran to their father and\nmother; and bread and cake were thrown into the water; and they all\nsaid, "The new one is the most beautiful of all! so young and handsome!"\nand the old swans bowed their heads before him.\n\nThen he felt quite ashamed, and hid his head under his wing, for he\ndid not know what to do; he was so happy, and yet not at all proud. He\nthought how he had been persecuted and despised; and now he heard them\nsaying that he was the most beautiful of all the birds. Even the elder\ntree bent its branches straight down into the water before him, and the\nsun shone warm and mild. Then his wings rustled, he lifted his slender\nneck, and cried rejoicingly from the depths of his heart:\n\n"I never dreamed of so much happiness when I was still the Ugly\nDuckling!"\n\n199\n\nOne of the really successful modern attempts at telling new fairy\nstories was Granny\'s Wonderful Chair (1857) by the blind\npoet Frances Browne (1816-1887). In spite of the obstacles due to\nblindness, poverty, and ill-health, she succeeded in educating herself,\nand after achieving some fame as a poet left her mountain village 210 in\ncounty Donegal, Ireland, to make a literary career in Edinburgh and\nLondon. She published many volumes of poems, novels, and children\'s\nbooks. Only one of these is now much read or remembered, but it has\ntaken a firm place in the affections of children. In Granny\'s\nWonderful Chair there are seven stories, set in an interesting\nframework which tells of the adventures of the little girl Snowflower\nand her chair at the court of King Winwealth. This chair had magic power\nto transport Snowflower wherever she wished to go, like the magic carpet\nin the Arabian Nights. When she laid down her head and\nsaid, "Chair of my grandmother, tell me a story," a clear voice from\nunder the cushion would at once begin to speak. Besides the story that\nfollows, two of the most satisfactory in the collection are "The Greedy\nShepherd" and "The Story of Merrymind." Perhaps one of the secrets of\ntheir charm is in the power of visualization which the author possessed.\nThe pictures are all clear and definite, yet touched with the glamor of\nfairyland.\n\nTHE STORY OF FAIRYFOOT\n\nFRANCES BROWNE\n\nOnce upon a time there stood far away in the west country a town\ncalled Stumpinghame. It contained seven windmills, a royal palace, a\nmarket place, and a prison, with every other convenience befitting the\ncapital of a kingdom. A capital city was Stumpinghame, and its\ninhabitants thought it the only one in the world. It stood in the midst\nof a great plain, which for three leagues round its walls was covered\nwith corn, flax, and orchards. Beyond that lay a great circle of pasture\nland, seven leagues in breadth, and it was bounded on all sides by a\nforest so thick and old that no man in Stumpinghame knew its extent; and\nthe opinion of the learned was that it reached to the end of the\nworld.\n\nThere were strong reasons for this opinion. First, that forest was\nknown to be inhabited time out of mind by the fairies, and no hunter\ncared to go beyond its border—so all the west country believed it to be\nsolidly full of old trees to the heart. Secondly, the people of\nStumpinghame were no travelers—man, woman, and child had feet so large\nand heavy that it was by no means convenient to carry them far. Whether\nit was the nature of the place or the people, I cannot tell, but great\nfeet had been the fashion there time immemorial, and the higher the\nfamily the larger were they. It was, therefore, the aim of everybody\nabove the degree of shepherds, and such-like rustics, to swell out and\nenlarge their feet by way of gentility; and so successful were they in\nthese undertakings that, on a pinch, respectable people\'s slippers would\nhave served for panniers.\n\nStumpinghame had a king of its own, and his name was Stiffstep; his\nfamily was very ancient and large-footed. His subjects called him Lord\nof the World, and he made a speech to them every year concerning the\ngrandeur of his mighty empire. His queen, Hammerheel, was the greatest\nbeauty in Stumpinghame. Her majesty\'s shoe was not much less than a\nfishing-boat; their six children promised to be quite as handsome, and\nall went well with them till the birth of their seventh son.\n\nFor a long time nobody about the palace could understand what was the\nmatter—the ladies-in-waiting looked so astonished, and the king so\nvexed; but at last it was whispered through the city that the queen\'s\nseventh child had been born with such miserably small feet that 211 they\nresembled nothing ever seen or heard of in Stumpinghame, except the feet\nof the fairies.\n\nThe chronicles furnished no example of such an affliction ever before\nhappening in the royal family. The common people thought it portended\nsome great calamity to the city; the learnèd men began to write books\nabout it; and all the relations of the king and queen assembled at the\npalace to mourn with them over their singular misfortune. The whole\ncourt and most of the citizens helped in this mourning, but when it had\nlasted seven days they all found out it was of no use. So the relations\nwent to their homes, and the people took to their work. If the learnèd\nmen\'s books were written, nobody ever read them; and to cheer up the\nqueen\'s spirits, the young prince was sent privately out to the pasture\nlands, to be nursed among the shepherds.\n\nThe chief man there was called Fleecefold, and his wife\'s name was\nRough Ruddy. They lived in a snug cottage with their son Blackthorn and\ntheir daughter Brownberry, and were thought great people, because they\nkept the king\'s sheep. Moreover, Fleecefold\'s family were known to be\nancient; and Rough Ruddy boasted that she had the largest feet in all\nthe pastures. The shepherds held them in high respect, and it grew still\nhigher when the news spread that the king\'s seventh son had been sent to\ntheir cottage. People came from all quarters to see the young prince,\nand great were the lamentations over his misfortune in having such small\nfeet.\n\nThe king and queen had given him fourteen names, beginning with\nAugustus—such being the fashion in that royal family; but the honest\ncountry people could not remember so many; besides, his feet were the\nmost remarkable thing about the child, so with one accord they called\nhim Fairyfoot. At first it was feared this might be high treason, but\nwhen no notice was taken by the king or his ministers, the shepherds\nconcluded it was no harm, and the boy never had another name throughout\nthe pastures. At court it was not thought polite to speak of him at all.\nThey did not keep his birthday, and he was never sent for at Christmas,\nbecause the queen and her ladies could not bear the sight. Once a year\nthe undermost scullion was sent to see how he did, with a bundle of his\nnext brother\'s cast-off clothes; and, as the king grew old and cross, it\nwas said he had thoughts of disowning him.\n\nSo Fairyfoot grew in Fleecefold\'s cottage. Perhaps the country air\nmade him fair and rosy—for all agreed that he would have been a handsome\nboy but for his small feet, with which nevertheless he learned to walk,\nand in time to run and to jump, thereby amazing everybody, for such\ndoings were not known among the children of Stumpinghame. The news of\ncourt, however, traveled to the shepherds, and Fairyfoot was despised\namong them. The old people thought him unlucky; the children refused to\nplay with him. Fleecefold was ashamed to have him in his cottage, but he\ndurst not disobey the king\'s orders. Moreover, Blackthorn wore most of\nthe clothes brought by the scullion. At last, Rough Ruddy found out that\nthe sight of such horrid jumping would make her children vulgar; and, as\nsoon as he was old enough, she sent Fairyfoot every day to watch some\nsickly sheep that grazed on a wild, weedy pasture, hard by the forest.\n\nPoor Fairyfoot was often lonely and sorrowful; many a time he wished\nhis feet would grow larger, or that people wouldn\'t notice them so much;\nand all the comfort he had was running and jumping by himself in the\nwild pasture, and thinking that none of the shepherds\' children could do\nthe like, for all their pride of their great feet.\n\nTired of this sport, he was lying in the shadow of a mossy rock one\nwarm summer\'s noon, with the sheep feeding around, when a robin, pursued\nby a great hawk, flew into the old velvet cap which lay on the ground\nbeside him. Fairyfoot covered it up, and the hawk, frightened by his\nshout, flew away.\n\n"Now you may go, poor robin!" he said, opening the cap: but instead\nof the bird, out sprang a little man dressed in russet-brown, and\nlooking as if he were an hundred years old. Fairyfoot could not speak\nfor astonishment, but the little man said—\n\n"Thank you for your shelter, and be sure I will do as much for you.\nCall on me if you are ever in trouble; my name is Robin Goodfellow"; and\ndarting off, he was out of sight in an instant. For days the boy\nwondered who that little man could be, but he told nobody, for the\nlittle man\'s feet were as small as his own, and it was clear he would be\nno favorite in Stumpinghame. Fairyfoot kept the story to himself, and at\nlast midsummer came. That evening was a feast among the shepherds. There\nwere bonfires on the hills, and fun in the villages. But Fairyfoot sat\nalone beside his sheepfold, for the children of his village had refused\nto let him dance with them about the bonfire, and he had gone there to\nbewail the size of his feet, which came between him and so many good\nthings. Fairyfoot had never felt so lonely in all his life, and\nremembering the little man, he plucked up spirit, and cried—\n\n"Ho! Robin Goodfellow!"\n\n"Here I am," said a shrill voice at his elbow; and there stood the\nlittle man himself.\n\n"I am very lonely, and no one will play with me, because my feet are\nnot large enough," said Fairyfoot.\n\n"Come then and play with us," said the little man. "We lead the\nmerriest lives in the world, and care for nobody\'s feet; but all\ncompanies have their own manners, and there are two things you must mind\namong us: first, do as you see the rest doing; and secondly, never speak\nof anything you may hear or see, for we and the people of this country\nhave had no friendship ever since large feet came in fashion."\n\n"I will do that, and anything more you like," said Fairyfoot; and the\nlittle man, taking his hand, led him over the pasture into the forest\nand along a mossy path among old trees wreathed with ivy (he never knew\nhow far), till they heard the sound of music and came upon a meadow\nwhere the moon shone as bright as day, and all the flowers of the\nyear—snowdrops, violets, primroses, and cowslips—bloomed together in the\nthick grass. There were a crowd of little men and women, some clad in\nrusset color, but far more in green, dancing round a little well as\nclear as crystal. And under great rose-trees which grew here and there\nin the meadow, companies were sitting round low tables covered with cups\nof milk, dishes of honey, and carved wooden flagons filled with clear\nred wine. The little man led Fairyfoot up to the nearest table, handed\nhim one of the flagons, and said 213—\n\n"Drink to the good company."\n\nWine was not very common among the shepherds of Stumpinghame, and the\nboy had never tasted such drink as that before; for scarcely had it gone\ndown when he forgot all his troubles—how Blackthorn and Brownberry wore\nhis clothes, how Rough Ruddy sent him to keep the sickly sheep, and the\nchildren would not dance with him: in short, he forgot the whole\nmisfortune of his feet, and it seemed to his mind that he was a king\'s\nson, and all was well with him. All the little people about the well\ncried—"Welcome! welcome!" and every one said—"Come and dance with me!"\nSo Fairyfoot was as happy as a prince, and drank milk and ate honey till\nthe moon was low in the sky, and then the little man took him by the\nhand, and never stopped nor stayed till he was at his own bed of straw\nin the cottage corner.\n\nNext morning Fairyfoot was not tired for all his dancing. Nobody in\nthe cottage had missed him, and he went out with the sheep as usual; but\nevery night all that summer, when the shepherds were safe in bed, the\nlittle man came and took him away to dance in the forest. Now he did not\ncare to play with the shepherds\' children, nor grieve that his father\nand mother had forgotten him, but watched the sheep all day, singing to\nhimself or plaiting rushes; and when the sun went down, Fairyfoot\'s\nheart rejoiced at the thought of meeting that merry company.\n\nThe wonder was that he was never tired nor sleepy, as people are apt\nto be who dance all night; but before the summer was ended Fairyfoot\nfound out the reason. One night, when the moon was full, and the last of\nthe ripe corn rustling in the fields, Robin Goodfellow came for him as\nusual, and away they went to the flowery green. The fun there was high,\nand Robin was in haste. So he only pointed to the carved cup from which\nFairyfoot every night drank the clear red wine.\n\n"I am not thirsty, and there is no use losing time," thought the boy\nto himself, and he joined the dance; but never in all his life did\nFairyfoot find such hard work as to keep pace with the company. Their\nfeet seemed to move like lightning, the swallows did not fly so fast or\nturn so quickly. Fairyfoot did his best, for he never gave in easily,\nbut at length, his breath and strength being spent, the boy was glad to\nsteal away and sit down behind a mossy oak, where his eyes closed for\nvery weariness. When he awoke the dance was nearly over, but two little\nladies clad in green talked close beside him.\n\n"What a beautiful boy!" said one of them. "He is worthy to be a\nking\'s son. Only see what handsome feet he has!"\n\n"Yes," said the other, with a laugh, that sounded spiteful; "they are\njust like the feet Princess Maybloom had before she washed them in the\nGrowing Well. Her father has sent far and wide throughout the whole\ncountry searching for a doctor to make them small again, but nothing in\nthis world can do it except the water of the Fair Fountain, and none but\nI and the nightingales know where it is."\n\n"One would not care to let the like be known," said the first little\nlady: "there would come such crowds of these great coarse creatures of\nmankind, nobody would have peace for leagues round. But you will surely\nsend word to the sweet princess!—she was so kind to our birds and\nbutterflies, and danced so like one of ourselves!" 214\n\n"Not I, indeed!" said the spiteful fairy. "Her old skinflint of a\nfather cut down the cedar which I loved best in the whole forest, and\nmade a chest of it to hold his money in; besides, I never liked the\nprincess—everybody praised her so. But come, we shall be too late for\nthe last dance."\n\nWhen they were gone, Fairyfoot could sleep no more with astonishment.\nHe did not wonder at the fairies admiring his feet, because their own\nwere much the same; but it amazed him that Princess Maybloom\'s father\nshould be troubled at hers growing large. Moreover, he wished to see\nthat same princess and her country, since there were really other places\nin the world than Stumpinghame.\n\nWhen Robin Goodfellow came to take him home as usual he durst not let\nhim know that he had overheard anything; but never was the boy so\nunwilling to get up as on that morning, and all day he was so weary that\nin the afternoon Fairyfoot fell asleep, with his head on a clump of\nrushes. It was seldom that any one thought of looking after him and the\nsickly sheep; but it so happened that towards evening the old shepherd,\nFleecefold, thought he would see how things went on in the pastures. The\nshepherd had a bad temper and a thick staff, and no sooner did he catch\nsight of Fairyfoot sleeping, and his flock straying away, than shouting\nall the ill names he could remember, in a voice which woke up the boy,\nhe ran after him as fast as his great feet would allow; while Fairyfoot,\nseeing no other shelter from his fury, fled into the forest, and never\nstopped nor stayed till he reached the banks of a little stream.\n\nThinking it might lead him to the fairies\' dancing-ground, he\nfollowed that stream for many an hour, but it wound away into the heart\nof the forest, flowing through dells, falling over mossy rocks, and at\nlast leading Fairyfoot, when he was tired and the night had fallen, to a\ngrove of great rose-trees, with the moon shining on it as bright as day,\nand thousands of nightingales singing in the branches. In the midst of\nthat grove was a clear spring, bordered with banks of lilies, and\nFairyfoot sat down by it to rest himself and listen. The singing was so\nsweet he could have listened for ever, but as he sat the nightingales\nleft off their songs, and began to talk together in the silence of the\nnight.\n\n"What boy is that," said one on a branch above him, "who sits so\nlonely by the Fair Fountain? He cannot have come from Stumpinghame with\nsuch small and handsome feet."\n\n"No, I\'ll warrant you," said another, "he has come from the west\ncountry. How in the world did he find the way?"\n\n"How simple you are!" said a third nightingale. "What had he to do\nbut follow the ground-ivy which grows over height and hollow, bank and\nbush, from the lowest gate of the king\'s kitchen garden to the root of\nthis rose-tree? He looks a wise boy, and I hope he will keep the secret,\nor we shall have all the west country here, dabbling in our fountain,\nand leaving us no rest to either talk or sing."\n\nFairyfoot sat in great astonishment at this discourse, but by and by,\nwhen the talk ceased and the songs began, he thought it might be as well\nfor him to follow the ground-ivy, and see the Princess Maybloom, not to\nspeak of getting rid of Rough Ruddy, the sickly sheep, and the crusty\nold shepherd. It 215 was a long journey; but he went on, eating wild\nberries by day, sleeping in the hollows of old trees by night, and never\nlosing sight of the ground-ivy, which led him over height and hollow,\nbank and bush, out of the forest, and along a noble high road, with\nfields and villages on every side, to a great city, and a low\nold-fashioned gate of the king\'s kitchen-garden, which was thought too\nmean for the scullions, and had not been opened for seven years.\n\nThere was no use knocking—the gate was overgrown with tall weeds and\nmoss; so, being an active boy, he climbed over, and walked through the\ngarden, till a white fawn came frisking by, and he heard a soft voice\nsaying sorrowfully—\n\n"Come back, come back, my fawn! I cannot run and play with you now,\nmy feet have grown so heavy"; and looking round he saw the loveliest\nyoung princess in the world, dressed in snow-white, and wearing a wreath\nof roses on her golden hair; but walking slowly, as the great people did\nin Stumpinghame, for her feet were as large as the best of them.\n\nAfter her came six young ladies, dressed in white and walking slowly,\nfor they could not go before the princess; but Fairyfoot was amazed to\nsee that their feet were as small as his own. At once he guessed that\nthis must be the Princess Maybloom, and made her an humble bow,\nsaying—\n\n"Royal princess, I have heard of your trouble because your feet have\ngrown large; in my country that\'s all the fashion. For seven years past\nI have been wondering what would make mine grow, to no purpose; but I\nknow of a certain fountain that will make yours smaller and finer than\never they were, if the king, your father, gives you leave to come with\nme, accompanied by two of your maids that are the least given to\ntalking, and the most prudent officer in all his household; for it would\ngrievously offend the fairies and the nightingales to make that fountain\nknown."\n\nWhen the princess heard that, she danced for joy in spite of her\nlarge feet, and she and her six maids brought Fairyfoot before the king\nand queen, where they sat in their palace hall, with all the courtiers\npaying their morning compliments. The lords were very much astonished to\nsee a ragged, bare-footed boy brought in among them, and the ladies\nthought Princess Maybloom must have gone mad; but Fairyfoot, making an\nhumble reverence, told his message to the king and queen, and offered to\nset out with the princess that very day. At first the king would not\nbelieve that there could be any use in his offer, because so many great\nphysicians had failed to give any relief. The courtiers laughed\nFairyfoot to scorn, the pages wanted to turn him out for an impudent\nimpostor, and the prime minister said he ought to be put to death for\nhigh treason.\n\nFairyfoot wished himself safe in the forest again, or even keeping\nthe sickly sheep; but the queen, being a prudent woman, said—\n\n"I pray your majesty to notice what fine feet this boy has. There may\nbe some truth in his story. For the sake of our only daughter, I will\nchoose two maids who talk the least of all our train, and my\nchamberlain, who is the most discreet officer in our household. Let them\ngo with the princess; who knows but our sorrow may be lessened?"\n\nAfter some persuasion the king consented, though all his councillors\nadvised 216 the contrary. So the two silent maids, the\ndiscreet chamberlain, and her fawn, which would not stay behind, were\nsent with Princess Maybloom, and they all set out after dinner.\nFairyfoot had hard work guiding them along the track of the ground-ivy.\nThe maids and the chamberlain did not like the brambles and rough roots\nof the forest—they thought it hard to eat berries and sleep in hollow\ntrees; but the princess went on with good courage, and at last they\nreached the grove of rose-trees, and the spring bordered with\nlilies.\n\nThe chamberlain washed—and though his hair had been grey, and his\nface wrinkled, the young courtiers envied his beauty for years after.\nThe maids washed—and from that day they were esteemed the fairest in all\nthe palace. Lastly, the princess washed also—it could make her no\nfairer, but the moment her feet touched the water they grew less, and\nwhen she had washed and dried them three times, they were as small and\nfinely-shaped as Fairyfoot\'s own. There was great joy among them, but\nthe boy said sorrowfully—\n\n"Oh! if there had been a well in the world to make my feet large, my\nfather and mother would not have cast me off, nor sent me to live among\nthe shepherds."\n\n"Cheer up your heart," said the Princess Maybloom; "if you want large\nfeet, there is a well in this forest that will do it. Last summer time I\ncame with my father and his foresters to see a great cedar cut down, of\nwhich he meant to make a money chest. While they were busy with the\ncedar, I saw a bramble branch covered with berries. Some were ripe and\nsome were green, but it was the longest bramble that ever grew; for the\nsake of the berries, I went on and on to its root, which grew hard by a\nmuddy-looking well, with banks of dark green moss, in the deepest part\nof the forest. The day was warm and dry and my feet were sore with the\nrough ground, so I took off my scarlet shoes and washed my feet in the\nwell; but as I washed they grew larger every minute, and nothing could\never make them less again. I have seen the bramble this day; it is not\nfar off, and as you have shown me the Fair Fountain, I will show you the\nGrowing Well."\n\nUp rose Fairyfoot and Princess Maybloom, and went together till they\nfound the bramble, and came to where its root grew, hard by the\nmuddy-looking well, with banks of dark green moss in the deepest dell of\nthe forest. Fairyfoot sat down to wash, but at that minute he heard a\nsound of music, and knew it was the fairies going to their dancing\nground.\n\n"If my feet grow large," said the boy to himself, "how shall I dance\nwith them?" So, rising quickly, he took the Princess Maybloom by the\nhand. The fawn followed them; the maids and the chamberlain followed it,\nand all followed the music through the forest. At last they came to the\nflowery green. Robin Goodfellow welcomed the company for Fairyfoot\'s\nsake, and gave every one a drink of the fairies\' wine. So they danced\nthere from sunset till the grey morning, and nobody was tired; but\nbefore the lark sang, Robin Goodfellow took them all safe home, as he\nused to take Fairyfoot.\n\nThere was great joy that day in the palace because Princess\nMaybloom\'s feet were made small again. The king gave Fairyfoot all\nmanner of fine clothes and rich jewels; and when they heard his\nwonderful story, he and the queen asked 217 him to live with them and be\ntheir son. In process of time Fairyfoot and Princess Maybloom were\nmarried, and still live happily. When they go to visit at Stumpinghame,\nthey always wash their feet in the Growing Well, lest the royal family\nmight think them a disgrace, but when they come back, they make haste to\nthe Fair Fountain; and the fairies and the nightingales are great\nfriends to them, as well as the maids and the chamberlain, because they\nhave told nobody about it, and there is peace and quiet yet in the grove\nof rose-trees.\n\n200\n\nThe ill-fated Oscar Wilde (1856-1900) was born in Ireland, was\neducated at Oxford, came into great notoriety as the reputed leader of\nthe "aesthetic movement," was prominent in the London literary world\nfrom 1885 to 1895, fell under the obloquy of most of his countrymen, and\ndied in distressing circumstances in Paris. In addition to some\nremarkable plays, poems, and prose books, he wrote a number of unusual\nstories especially fascinating to children, which were collected under\nthe title The Happy Prince, and Other Tales. These stories\nwere at once recognized as classic in quality. While they contain much\nimplied criticism of certain features of modern civilization, the whole\ntone is so idealistic and the workmanship so fine that they convey no\nstrong note of bitterness to the child. "The Happy Prince" suggests that\nWilde saw on the one hand "the white faces of starving children looking\nout listlessly at the black streets"; while on the other hand he saw the\nPyramids, marble angels sculptured on the cathedral tower, and the\ngold-covered statue of the Prince of the Palace of the Care-Free. Wilde\nalso suggests a remedy for the starvation and wretchedness that exist,\nespecially among children, in most cities where great wealth is\ndisplayed. The important thing in presenting this story to children is\nto get the full sympathetic response due to the sacrifice made by the\nHappy Prince and the little swallow. So much of the effect depends upon\nthe wonderful beauty of the language that teachers will, as a rule, get\nbetter results from reading or reciting than from any kind of oral\nparaphrase. Another story in this same volume widely and successfully\nused by teachers is the one called "The Selfish Giant."\n\nTHE HAPPY PRINCE\n\nOSCAR WILDE\n\nHigh above the city, on a tall column, stood the statue of the Happy\nPrince. He was gilded all over with thin leaves of fine gold, for eyes\nhe had two bright sapphires, and a large red ruby glowed on his\nsword-hilt.\n\nHe was very much admired indeed. "He is as beautiful as a\nweathercock," remarked one of the Town Councillors who wished to gain a\nreputation for having artistic tastes; "only not quite so useful," he\nadded, fearing lest people should think him unpractical, which he really\nwas not.\n\n"Why can\'t you be like the Happy Prince?" asked a sensible mother of\nher little boy who was crying for the moon. "The Happy Prince never\ndreams of crying for anything."\n\n"I am glad there is some one in the world who is quite happy,"\nmuttered a disappointed man as he gazed at the wonderful statue.\n\n"He looks just like an angel," said the Charity Children as they came\nout of the cathedral in their bright scarlet cloaks and their clean\nwhite pinafores.\n\n"How do you know?" said the Mathematical Master; "you have never seen\none." 218\n\n"Ah! but we have, in our dreams," answered the children; and the\nMathematical Master frowned and looked very severe, for he did not\napprove of children dreaming.\n\nOne night there flew over the city a Little Swallow. His friends had\ngone away to Egypt six weeks before, but he had stayed behind, for he\nwas in love with the most beautiful Reed. He had met her early in the\nspring as he was flying down the river after a big yellow moth, and had\nbeen so attracted by her slender waist that he had stopped to talk to\nher.\n\n"Shall I love you?" said the Swallow, who liked to come to the point\nat once, and the Reed made him a low bow. So he flew round and round\nher, touching the water with his wings, and making silver ripples. This\nwas his courtship, and it lasted all through the summer.\n\n"It is a ridiculous attachment," twittered the other Swallows; "she\nhas no money, and far too many relations"; and indeed the river was\nquite full of Reeds. Then when the autumn came they all flew away.\n\nAfter they had gone he felt lonely, and began to tire of his\nlady-love. "She has no conversation," he said, "and I am afraid that she\nis a coquette, for she is always flirting with the wind." And certainly,\nwhenever the wind blew, the Reed made the most graceful curtseys. "I\nadmit that she is domestic," he continued, "but I love traveling, and my\nwife, consequently, should love traveling also."\n\n"Will you come away with me?" he said finally to her; but the Reed\nshook her head, she was so attached to her home.\n\n"You have been trifling with me," he cried. "I am off to the\nPyramids. Good-bye!" and he flew away.\n\nAll day long he flew, and at night-time he arrived at the city.\n"Where shall I put up?" he said; "I hope the town has made\npreparations."\n\nThen he saw the statue on the tall column.\n\n"I will put up there," he cried; "it is a fine position, with plenty\nof fresh air." So he alighted just between the feet of the Happy\nPrince.\n\n"I have a golden bedroom," he said softly to himself as he looked\nround, and he prepared to go to sleep; but just as he was putting his\nhead under his wing a large drop of water fell on him. "What a curious\nthing!" he cried; "there is not a single cloud in the sky, the stars are\nquite clear and bright, and yet it is raining. The climate in the north\nof Europe is really dreadful. The Reed used to like the rain, but that\nwas merely her selfishness."\n\nThen another drop fell.\n\n"What is the use of a statue if it cannot keep the rain off?" he\nsaid; "I must look for a good chimney-pot," and he determined to fly\naway.\n\nBut before he had opened his wings, a third drop fell, and he looked\nup, and saw—Ah! what did he see?\n\nThe eyes of the Happy Prince were filled with tears, and tears were\nrunning down his golden cheeks. His face was so beautiful in the\nmoonlight that the little Swallow was filled with pity.\n\n"Who are you?" he said.\n\n"I am the Happy Prince."\n\n"Why are you weeping then?" asked the Swallow; "you have quite\ndrenched me."\n\n"When I was alive and had a human heart," answered the statue, "I did\nnot know what tears were, for I lived in the Palace of Sans-Souci, where\nsorrow is not allowed to enter. In the daytime I 219 played\nwith my companions in the garden, and in the evening I led the dance in\nthe Great Hall. Round the garden ran a very lofty wall, but I never\ncared to ask what lay beyond it, everything about me was so beautiful.\nMy courtiers called me the Happy Prince, and happy indeed I was, if\npleasure be happiness. So I lived, and so I died. And now that I am dead\nthey have set me up here so high that I can see all the ugliness and all\nthe misery of my city, and though my heart is made of lead yet I cannot\nchoose but weep."\n\n"What! is he not solid gold?" said the Swallow to himself. He was too\npolite to make any personal remarks out loud.\n\n"Far away," continued the statue in a low musical voice, "far away in\na little street there is a poor house. One of the windows is open, and\nthrough it I can see a woman seated at a table. Her face is thin and\nworn, and she has coarse, red hands, all pricked by the needle, for she\nis a seamstress. She is embroidering passion-flowers on a satin gown for\nthe loveliest of the Queen\'s maids-of-honor to wear at the next\nCourt-ball. In a bed in the corner of the room her little boy is lying\nill. He has a fever, and is asking for oranges. His mother has nothing\nto give him but river water, so he is crying. Swallow, Swallow, little\nSwallow, will you not take her the ruby out of my sword-hilt? My feet\nare fastened to this pedestal and I cannot move."\n\n"I am waited for in Egypt," said the Swallow. "My friends are flying\nup and down the Nile, and talking to the large lotus-flowers. Soon they\nwill go to sleep in the tomb of the great King. The King is there\nhimself in his painted coffin. He is wrapped in yellow linen, and\nembalmed with spices. Round his neck is a chain of pale green jade, and\nhis hands are like withered leaves."\n\n"Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow," said the Prince, "will you not\nstay with me for one night, and be my messenger? The boy is so thirsty,\nand the mother so sad."\n\n"I don\'t think I like boys," answered the Swallow. "Last summer, when\nI was staying on the river, there were two rude boys, the miller\'s sons,\nwho were always throwing stones at me. They never hit me, of course; we\nswallows fly far too well for that, and besides, I come of a family\nfamous for its agility; but still, it was a mark of disrespect."\n\nBut the Happy Prince looked so sad that the little Swallow was sorry.\n"It is very cold here," he said; "but I will stay with you for one\nnight, and be your messenger."\n\n"Thank you, little Swallow," said the Prince.\n\nSo the Swallow picked out the great ruby from the Prince\'s sword, and\nflew away with it in his beak over the roofs of the town.\n\nHe passed by the cathedral tower, where the white marble angels were\nsculptured. He passed by the palace and heard the sound of dancing. A\nbeautiful girl came out on the balcony with her lover. "How wonderful\nthe stars are," he said to her, "and how wonderful is the power of\nlove!"\n\n"I hope my dress will be ready in time for the State-ball," she\nanswered; "I have ordered passion-flowers to be embroidered on it; but\nthe seamstresses are so lazy."\n\nHe passed over the river, and saw the lanterns hanging to the masts\nof the ships. He passed over the Ghetto, and saw the old Jews bargaining\nwith each 220 other, and weighing out money in copper scales.\nAt last he came to the poor house and looked in. The boy was tossing\nfeverishly on his bed, and the mother had fallen asleep, she was so\ntired. In he hopped, and laid the great ruby on the table beside the\nwoman\'s thimble. Then he flew gently round the bed, fanning the boy\'s\nforehead with his wings. "How cool I feel," said the boy. "I must be\ngetting better"; and he sank into a delicious slumber.\n\nThen the Swallow flew back to the Happy Prince, and told him what he\nhad done. "It is curious," he remarked, "but I feel quite warm now,\nalthough it is so cold."\n\n"That is because you have done a good action," said the Prince. And\nthe little Swallow began to think, and then he fell asleep. Thinking\nalways made him sleepy.\n\nWhen day broke he flew down to the river and had a bath. "What a\nremarkable phenomenon," said the Professor of Ornithology as he was\npassing over the bridge. "A swallow in winter!" And he wrote a long\nletter about it to the local newspaper. Every one quoted it, it was full\nof so many words that they could not understand.\n\n"To-night I go to Egypt," said the Swallow, and he was in high\nspirits at the prospect. He visited all the public monuments, and sat a\nlong time on top of the church steeple. Wherever he went the Sparrows\nchirruped, and said to each other, "What a distinguished stranger!" so\nhe enjoyed himself very much.\n\nWhen the moon rose he flew back to the Happy Prince. "Have you any\ncommissions for Egypt?" he cried; "I am just starting."\n\n"Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow," said the Prince, "will you not\nstay with me one night longer?"\n\n"I am waited for in Egypt," answered the Swallow. "To-morrow my\nfriends will fly up to the Second Cataract. The river-horse couches\nthere among the bulrushes, and on a great granite throne sits the God\nMemnon. All night long he watches the stars, and when the morning star\nshines he utters one cry of joy, and then he is silent. At noon the\nyellow lions come down to the water\'s edge to drink. They have eyes like\ngreen beryls, and their roar is louder than the roar of the\ncataract."\n\n"Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow," said the Prince, "far away across\nthe city I see a young man in a garret. He is leaning over a desk\ncovered with papers, and in a tumbler by his side there is a bunch of\nwithered violets. His hair is brown and crisp, and his lips are red as a\npomegranate, and he has large and dreamy eyes. He is trying to finish a\nplay for the Director of the Theatre, but he is too cold to write any\nmore. There is no fire in the grate, and hunger has made him faint."\n\n"I will wait with you one night longer," said the Swallow, who really\nhad a good heart. "Shall I take him another ruby?"\n\n"Alas! I have no ruby now," said the Prince; "my eyes are all that I\nhave left. They are made of rare sapphires, which were brought out of\nIndia a thousand years ago. Pluck out one of them and take it to him. He\nwill sell it to the jeweller, and buy food and firewood, and finish his\nplay."\n\n"Dear Prince," said the Swallow, "I cannot do that"; and he began to\nweep.\n\n"Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow," said the Prince, "do as I command\nyou."\n\nSo the Swallow plucked out the 221 Prince\'s eye, and flew away to\nthe student\'s garret. It was easy enough to get in, as there was a hole\nin the roof. Through this he darted, and came into the room. The young\nman had his head buried in his hands, so he did not hear the flutter of\nthe bird\'s wings, and when he looked up he found the beautiful sapphire\nlying on the withered violets.\n\n"I am beginning to be appreciated," he cried; "this is from some\ngreat admirer. Now I can finish my play," and he looked quite happy.\n\nThe next day the Swallow flew down to the harbor. He sat on the mast\nof a large vessel and watched the sailors hauling big chests out of the\nhold with ropes. "Heave a-hoy!" they shouted as each chest came up. "I\nam going to Egypt!" cried the Swallow, but nobody minded, and when the\nmoon rose he flew back to the Happy Prince.\n\n"I am come to bid you good-bye," he cried.\n\n"Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow," said the Prince, "will you not\nstay with me one night longer?"\n\n"It is winter," answered the Swallow, "and the chill snow will soon\nbe here. In Egypt the sun is warm on the green palm-trees, and the\ncrocodiles lie in the mud and look lazily about them. My companions are\nbuilding a nest in the Temple of Baalbec, and the pink and white doves\nare watching them, and cooing to each other. Dear Prince, I must leave\nyou, but I will never forget you, and next spring I will bring you back\ntwo beautiful jewels in place of those you have given away. The ruby\nshall be redder than a red rose, and the sapphire shall be as blue as\nthe great sea."\n\n"In the square below," said the Happy Prince, "there stands a little\nmatch-girl. She has let her matches fall in the gutter, and they are all\nspoiled. Her father will beat her if she does not bring home some money,\nand she is crying. She has no shoes or stockings, and her little head is\nbare. Pluck out my other eye, and give it to her, and her father will\nnot beat her."\n\n"I will stay with you one night longer," said the Swallow, "but I\ncannot pluck out your eye. You would be quite blind then."\n\n"Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow," said the Prince, "do as I command\nyou."\n\nSo he plucked out the Prince\'s other eye, and darted down with it. He\nswooped past the match-girl, and slipped the jewel into the palm of her\nhand. "What a lovely bit of glass," cried the little girl; and she ran\nhome, laughing.\n\nThen the Swallow came back to the Prince. "You are blind now," he\nsaid, "so I will stay with you always."\n\n"No, little Swallow," said the poor Prince, "you must go away to\nEgypt."\n\n"I will stay with you always," said the Swallow, and he slept at the\nPrince\'s feet.\n\nAll the next day he sat on the Prince\'s shoulder, and told him\nstories of what he had seen in strange lands. He told him of the red\nibises, who stand in long rows on the banks of the Nile, and catch\ngoldfish in their beaks; of the Sphinx, who is as old as the world\nitself, and lives in the desert, and knows everything; of the merchants,\nwho walk slowly by the side of their camels, and carry amber beads in\ntheir hands; of the King of the Mountains of the Moon, who is as black\nas ebony, and worships a large crystal; of the great green snake that\nsleeps in a palm-tree, and has twenty priests to feed it with\nhoney-cakes; and of the pygmies who sail over a big lake on large flat\n222\nleaves, and are always at war with the butterflies.\n\n"Dear little Swallow," said the Prince, "you tell me of marvelous\nthings, but more marvelous than anything is the suffering of men and of\nwomen. There is no Mystery so great as Misery. Fly over my city, little\nSwallow, and tell me what you see there."\n\nSo the Swallow flew over the great city, and saw the rich making\nmerry in their beautiful houses, while the beggars were sitting at the\ngates. He flew into dark lanes, and saw the white faces of starving\nchildren looking out listlessly at the black streets. Under the archway\nof a bridge two little boys were lying in one another\'s arms to try to\nkeep themselves warm. "How hungry we are!" they said. "You must not lie\nhere," shouted the Watchman, and they wandered out into the rain.\n\nThen he flew back and told the Prince what he had seen.\n\n"I am covered with fine gold," said the Prince; "you must take it\noff, leaf by leaf, and give it to my poor; the living always think that\ngold can make them happy."\n\nLeaf after leaf of the fine gold the Swallow picked off, till the\nHappy Prince looked quite dull and grey. Leaf after leaf of the fine\ngold he brought to the poor, and the children\'s faces grew rosier, and\nthey laughed and played games in the street. "We have bread now!" they\ncried.\n\nThen the snow came, and after the snow came the frost. The streets\nlooked as if they were made of silver, they were so bright and\nglistening; long icicles like crystal daggers hung down from the eaves\nof the houses, everybody went about in furs, and the little boys wore\nscarlet caps and skated on the ice.\n\nThe poor little Swallow grew colder and colder, but he would not\nleave the Prince; he loved him too well. He picked up crumbs outside the\nbaker\'s door when the baker was not looking, and tried to keep himself\nwarm by flapping his wings.\n\nBut at last he knew that he was going to die. He had just strength to\nfly up to the Prince\'s shoulder once more. "Good-bye, dear Prince!" he\nmurmured, "will you let me kiss your hand?"\n\n"I am glad that you are going to Egypt at last, little Swallow," said\nthe Prince. "You have stayed too long here; but you must kiss me on the\nlips, for I love you."\n\n"It is not to Egypt that I am going," said the Swallow. "I am going\nto the House of Death. Death is the brother of Sleep, is he not?"\n\nAnd he kissed the Happy Prince on the lips, and fell down dead at his\nfeet.\n\nAt that moment a curious crack sounded inside the statue, as if\nsomething had suddenly broken. The fact is that the leaden heart had\nsnapped right in two. It certainly was a dreadfully hard frost.\n\nEarly the next morning the Mayor was walking in the square below in\ncompany with the Town Councillors. As they passed the column he looked\nup at the statue: "Dear me! how shabby the Happy Prince looks!" he\nsaid.\n\n"How shabby indeed!" cried the Town Councillors, who always agreed\nwith the Mayor; and they went up to look at it.\n\n"The ruby has fallen out of his sword, his eyes are gone, and he is\ngolden no longer," said the Mayor; "in fact, he is little better than a\nbeggar!"\n\n"Little better than a beggar," said the Town Councillors.\n\n"And here is actually a dead bird at his feet!" continued the Mayor.\n"We 223 must really issue a proclamation that birds are\nnot to be allowed to die here." And the Town Clerk made a note of the\nsuggestion.\n\nSo they pulled down the statue of the Happy Prince. "As he is no\nlonger beautiful he is no longer useful," said the Art Professor at the\nUniversity.\n\nThen they melted the statue in a furnace, and the Mayor held a\nmeeting of the Corporation to decide what was to be done with the metal.\n"We must have another statue, of course," he said, "and it shall be a\nstatue of myself."\n\n"Of myself," said each of the Town Councillors, and they quarrelled.\nWhen I last heard of them they were quarreling still.\n\n"What a strange thing!" said the overseer of the workmen at the\nfoundry. "This broken lead heart will not melt in the furnace. We must\nthrow it away." So they threw it on a dustheap where the dead Swallow\nwas also lying.\n\n"Bring me the two most precious things in the city," said God to one\nof His Angels; and the Angel brought Him the leaden heart and the dead\nbird.\n\n"You have rightly chosen," said God, "for in my garden of Paradise\nthis little bird shall sing for evermore, and in my city of gold the\nHappy Prince shall praise me."\n\n201\n\nTwo stories of unusual interest and charm for children are found in\nthe collection of eleven by Raymond M. Alden (1873—), Why the\nChimes Rang. One is the title story of the volume; the other is\n"The Knights of the Silver Shield." The latter follows by permission of\nthe publishers, The Bobbs-Merrill Co., Indianapolis. (Copyright, 1906,\n1908.) It is of striking dramatic interest and emphasizes a much-needed\nquality of character, the importance of a loyal performance of the\nlowlier duties of life. The salvation of a nation may depend upon the\nhumble guardian of the gate quite as much as upon those who are engaged\nin the more spectacular struggle with giants. Mr. Alden is a scholarly\nprofessor of literature in Leland Stanford Jr. University, and it may\ninterest the reader to know that he is the son of the author of the\nPansy Books, a type of religious or Sunday-school fiction\nwidely read throughout the country by a generation or two of young\npeople.\n\nTHE KNIGHTS OF THE SILVER SHIELD\n\nRAYMOND MACDONALD ALDEN\n\nThere was once a splendid castle in a forest, with great stone walls\nand a high gateway, and turrets that rose away above the tallest trees.\nThe forest was dark and dangerous, and many cruel giants lived in it;\nbut in the castle was a company of knights, who were kept there by the\nking of the country, to help travelers who might be in the forest and to\nfight with the giants whenever they could.\n\nEach of these knights wore a beautiful suit of armor and carried a\nlong spear, while over his helmet there floated a great red plume that\ncould be seen a long way off by any one in distress. But the most\nwonderful thing about the knights\' armor was their shields. They were\nnot like those of other knights, but had been made by a great magician\nwho had lived in the castle many years before. They were made of silver,\nand sometimes shone in the sunlight with dazzling brightness; but at\nother times the surface of the shields would be clouded as though by a\nmist, and one could not see his face 224 reflected there as he could\nwhen they shone brightly.\n\nNow, when each young knight received his spurs and his armor, a new\nshield was also given him from among those that the magician had made;\nand when the shield was new its surface was always cloudy and dull. But\nas the knight began to do service against the giants, or went on\nexpeditions to help poor travelers in the forest, his shield grew\nbrighter and brighter, so that he could see his face clearly reflected\nin it. But if he proved to be a lazy or cowardly knight, and let the\ngiants get the better of him, or did not care what became of the\ntravelers, then the shield grew more and more cloudy, until the knight\nbecame ashamed to carry it.\n\nBut this was not all. When any one of the knights fought a\nparticularly hard battle, and won the victory, or when he went on some\nhard errand for the lord of the castle, and was successful, not only did\nhis silver shield grow brighter, but when one looked into the center of\nit he could see something like a golden star shining in its very heart.\nThis was the greatest honor that a knight could achieve, and the other\nknights always spoke of such a one as having "won his star." It was\nusually not till he was pretty old and tried as a soldier that he could\nwin it. At the time when this story begins, the lord of the castle\nhimself was the only one of the knights whose shield bore the golden\nstar.\n\nThere came a time when the worst of the giants in the forest gathered\nthemselves together to have a battle against the knights. They made a\ncamp in a dark hollow not far from the castle, and gathered all their\nbest warriors together, and all the knights made ready to fight them.\nThe windows of the castle were closed and barred; the air was full of\nthe noise of armor being made ready for use; and the knights were so\nexcited that they could scarcely rest or eat.\n\nNow there was a young knight in the castle, named Sir Roland, who was\namong those most eager for the battle. He was a splendid warrior, with\neyes that shone like stars whenever there was anything to do in the way\nof knightly deeds. And although he was still quite young, his shield had\nbegun to shine enough to show plainly that he had done bravely in some\nof his errands through the forest. This battle, he thought, would be the\ngreat opportunity of his life. And on the morning of the day when they\nwere to go forth to it, and all the knights assembled in the great hall\nof the castle to receive the commands of their leaders, Sir Roland hoped\nthat he would be put in the most dangerous place of all, so that he\ncould show what knightly stuff he was made of.\n\nBut when the lord of the castle came to him, as he went about in full\narmor giving his commands, he said: "One brave knight must stay behind\nand guard the gateway of the castle, and it is you, Sir Roland, being\none of the youngest, whom I have chosen for this."\n\nAt these words Sir Roland was so disappointed that he bit his lip and\nclosed his helmet over his face so that the other knights might not see\nit. For a moment he felt as if he must reply angrily to the commander\nand tell him that it was not right to leave so sturdy a knight behind\nwhen he was eager to fight. But he struggled against this feeling and\nwent quietly to look after his duties at the gate. The gateway was high\nand narrow, and was reached from outside by a high, narrow bridge that\ncrossed the moat, which 225 surrounded the castle on every side. When an\nenemy approached, the knight on guard rang a great bell just inside the\ngate, and the bridge was drawn up against the castle wall, so that no\none could come across the moat. So the giants had long ago given up\ntrying to attack the castle itself.\n\nTo-day the battle was to be in the dark hollow in the forest, and it\nwas not likely that there would be anything to do at the castle gate,\nexcept to watch it like a common doorkeeper. It was not strange that Sir\nRoland thought some one else might have done this.\n\nPresently all the other knights marched out in their flashing armor,\ntheir red plumes waving over their heads, and their spears in their\nhands. The lord of the castle stopped only to tell Sir Roland to keep\nguard over the gate until they had all returned and to let no one enter.\nThen they went into the shadows of the forest and were soon lost to\nsight.\n\nSir Roland stood looking after them long after they had gone,\nthinking how happy he would be if he were on the way to battle like\nthem. But after a little he put this out of his mind and tried to think\nof pleasanter things. It was a long time before anything happened, or\nany word came from the battle.\n\nAt last Sir Roland saw one of the knights come limping down the path\nto the castle, and he went out on the bridge to meet him. Now this\nknight was not a brave one, and he had been frightened away as soon as\nhe was wounded.\n\n"I have been hurt," he said, "so that I can not fight any more. But I\ncould watch the gate for you, if you would like to go back in my\nplace."\n\nAt first Sir Roland\'s heart leaped with joy at this, but then he\nremembered what the commander had told him on going away, and he\nsaid:\n\n"I should like to go, but a knight belongs where his commander has\nput him. My place is here at the gate, and I can not open it even for\nyou. Your place is at the battle."\n\nThe knight was ashamed when he heard this, and he presently turned\nabout and went into the forest again.\n\nSo Sir Roland kept guard silently for another hour. Then there came\nan old beggar woman down the path to the castle and asked Sir Roland if\nshe might come in and have some food. He told her that no one could\nenter the castle that day, but that he would send a servant out to her\nwith food, and that she might sit and rest as long as she would.\n\n"I have been past the hollow in the forest where the battle is going\non," said the old woman, while she was waiting for her food.\n\n"And how do you think it is going?" asked Sir Roland.\n\n"Badly for the knights, I am afraid," said the old woman. "The giants\nare fighting as they have never fought before. I should think you had\nbetter go and help your friends."\n\n"I should like to, indeed," said Sir Roland. "But I am set to guard\nthe gateway of the castle and can not leave."\n\n"One fresh knight would make a great difference when they are all\nweary with fighting," said the old woman. "I should think that, while\nthere are no enemies about, you would be much more useful there."\n\n"You may well think so," said Sir Roland, "and so may I; but it is\nneither you nor I that is commander here."\n\n"I suppose," said the old woman then, "that you are one of the kind\nof 226 knights who like to keep out of fighting. You are\nlucky to have so good an excuse for staying at home." And she laughed a\nthin and taunting laugh.\n\nThen Sir Roland was very angry, and thought that if it were only a\nman instead of a woman, he would show him whether he liked fighting or\nno. But as it was a woman, he shut his lips and set his teeth hard\ntogether, and as the servant came just then with the food he had sent\nfor, he gave it to the old woman quickly and shut the gate that she\nmight not talk to him any more.\n\nIt was not very long before he heard some one calling outside. Sir\nRoland opened the gate and saw standing at the other end of the\ndrawbridge a little old man in a long black cloak. "Why are you knocking\nhere?" he said. "The castle is closed to-day."\n\n"Are you Sir Roland?" said the little old man.\n\n"Yes," said Sir Roland.\n\n"Then you ought not to be staying here when your commander and his\nknights are having so hard a struggle with the giants, and when you have\nthe chance to make of yourself the greatest knight in this kingdom.\nListen to me! I have brought you a magic sword."\n\nAs he said this, the old man drew from under his coat a wonderful\nsword that flashed in the sunlight as if it were covered with diamonds.\n"This is the sword of all swords," he said, "and it is for you, if you\nwill leave your idling here by the castle gate and carry it to the\nbattle. Nothing can stand before it. When you lift it the giants will\nfall back, your master will be saved, and you will be crowned the\nvictorious knight—the one who will soon take his commander\'s place as\nlord of the castle."\n\nNow Sir Roland believed that it was a magician who was speaking to\nhim, for it certainly appeared to be a magic sword. It seemed so\nwonderful that the sword should be brought to him, that he reached out\nhis hand as though he would take it, and the little old man came\nforward, as though he would cross the drawbridge into the castle. But as\nhe did so, it came to Sir Roland\'s mind again that that bridge and the\ngateway had been intrusted to him, and he called out "No!" to the old\nman, so that he stopped where he was standing. But he waved the shining\nsword in the air again, and said: "It is for you! Take it, and win the\nvictory!"\n\nSir Roland was really afraid that if he looked any longer at the\nsword or listened to any more words of the old man, he would not be able\nto hold himself within the castle. For this reason he struck the great\nbell at the gateway, which was the signal for the servants inside to\npull in the chains of the drawbridge, and instantly they began to pull,\nand the drawbridge came up, so that the old man could not cross it to\nenter the castle, nor Sir Roland to go out.\n\nThen, as he looked across the moat, Sir Roland saw a wonderful thing.\nThe little old man threw off his black cloak, and as he did so he began\nto grow bigger and bigger, until in a minute more he was a giant as tall\nas any in the forest. At first Sir Roland could scarcely believe his\neyes. Then he realized that this must be one of their giant enemies, who\nhad changed himself to a little old man through some magic power, that\nhe might make his way into the castle while all the knights were away.\nSir Roland shuddered to think what might have happened if he had taken\nthe sword and left the gate unguarded. The giant shook his 227 fist\nacross the moat that lay between them, and then, knowing that he could\ndo nothing more, he went angrily back into the forest.\n\nSir Roland now resolved not to open the gate again, and to pay no\nattention to any other visitor. But it was not long before he heard a\nsound that made him spring forward in joy. It was the bugle of the lord\nof the castle, and there came sounding after it the bugles of many of\nthe knights that were with him, pealing so joyfully that Sir Roland was\nsure they were safe and happy. As they came nearer, he could hear their\nshouts of victory. So he gave the signal to let down the drawbridge\nagain, and went out to meet them. They were dusty and bloodstained and\nweary, but they had won the battle with the giants; and it had been such\na great victory that there had never been a happier home-coming.\n\nSir Roland greeted them all as they passed in over the bridge, and\nthen, when he had closed the gate and fastened it, he followed them into\nthe great hall of the castle. The lord of the castle took his place on\nthe highest seat, with the other knights about him, and Sir Roland came\nforward with the key of the gate, to give his account of what he had\ndone in the place to which the commander had appointed him. The lord of\nthe castle bowed to him as a sign for him to begin, but just as he\nopened his mouth to speak, one of the knights cried out:\n\n"The shield! the shield! Sir Roland\'s shield!"\n\nEvery one turned and looked at the shield which Sir Roland carried on\nhis left arm. He himself could see only the top of it and did not know\nwhat they could mean. But what they saw was the golden star of\nknighthood, shining brightly from the center of Sir Roland\'s shield.\nThere had never been such amazement in the castle before.\n\nSir Roland knelt before the lord of the castle to receive his\ncommands. He still did not know why every one was looking at him so\nexcitedly, and wondered if he had in some way done wrong.\n\n"Speak, Sir Knight," said the commander, as soon as he could find his\nvoice after his surprise, "and tell us all that has happened to-day at\nthe castle. Have you been attacked? Have any giants come hither? Did you\nfight them alone?"\n\n"No, my Lord," said Sir Roland. "Only one giant has been here, and he\nwent away silently when he found he could not enter."\n\nThen he told all that had happened through the day.\n\nWhen he had finished, the knights all looked at one another, but no\none spoke a word. Then they looked again at Sir Roland\'s shield, to make\nsure that their eyes had not deceived them, and there the golden star\nwas still shining.\n\nAfter a little silence the lord of the castle spoke.\n\n"Men make mistakes," he said, "but our silver shields are never\nmistaken. Sir Roland has fought and won the hardest battle of all\nto-day."\n\nThen the others all rose and saluted Sir Roland, who was the youngest\nknight that ever carried the golden star.\n\n202\n\nJean Ingelow (1820-1897) was an English poet, novelist, and writer of\nstories for children, who lived in the fen district of Lincolnshire. Her\nmost noted poem deals with a terrible catastrophe that happened there\nmore than three centuries ago. It  is called "The High Tide on the\nCoast of Lincolnshire." Many reading books for the third or fourth grade\ncontain her dainty and melodious "Seven Times One," in which a little\ngirl expresses the joy and sense of power felt on reaching a seventh\nbirthday. Of her children\'s books, the favorite is Mopsa the\nFairy, which some one has called a "delightful succession of\nbreezy impossibilities." Her shorter stories for children are collected\nunder the title Stories Told to a Child (two series), from\nwhich "The Prince\'s Dream" is taken. It is somewhat old fashioned in\nmethod and style, reminding one of the stories of the days of Addison\nand Steele. Its seriousness is in striking contrast with the more\nflippant note in much modern writing for children, and it is sure to\nsuggest some questions on the dangers and advantages of great\npossessions in their effects on labor, liberty, and human happiness in\ngeneral. However, the moral will take care of itself, and the attention\nshould rest on the means used by the old man to teach the young prince\nthe things he is shut out from learning by experience. The children will\neasily see that it is an anticipation of the moving-picture method. Some\nother good stories in the collection mentioned are "I Have a Right,"\n"The Fairy Who Judged Her Neighbors," and "Anselmo."\n\nTHE PRINCE\'S DREAM\n\nJEAN INGELOW\n\nIf we may credit the fable, there is a tower in the midst of a great\nAsiatic plain, wherein is confined a prince who was placed there in his\nearliest infancy, with many slaves and attendants, and all the luxuries\nthat are compatible with imprisonment.\n\nWhether he was brought there from some motive of state, whether to\nconceal him from enemies, or to deprive him of rights, has not\ntranspired; but it is certain that up to the date of this little history\nhe had never set his foot outside the walls of that high tower, and that\nof the vast world without he knew only the green plains which surrounded\nit; the flocks and the birds of that region were all his experience of\nliving creatures, and all the men he saw outside were shepherds.\n\nAnd yet he was not utterly deprived of change, for sometimes one of\nhis attendants would be ordered away, and his place would be supplied by\na new one. This fresh companion the prince would never weary of\nquestioning, and letting him talk of cities, of ships, of forests, of\nmerchandise, of kings; but though in turns they all tried to satisfy his\ncuriosity, they could not succeed in conveying very distinct notions to\nhis mind; partly because there was nothing in the tower to which they\ncould compare the external world, partly because, having chiefly lived\nlives of seclusion and indolence in Eastern palaces, they knew it only\nby hearsay themselves.\n\nAt length, one day, a venerable man of a noble presence was brought\nto the tower, with soldiers to guard him and slaves to attend him. The\nprince was glad of his presence, though at first he seldom opened his\nlips, and it was manifest that confinement made him miserable. With\nrestless feet he would wander from window to window of the stone tower,\nand mount from story to story; but mount as high as he would there was\nstill nothing to be seen but the vast unvarying plain, clothed with\nscanty grass, and flooded with the glaring sunshine; flocks and herds,\nand shepherds, moved across it sometimes, but nothing else, not even a\nshadow, for there was no cloud in the sky to cast one.\n\nThe old man, however, always treated the prince with respect, and\nanswered his questions with a great deal of patience, till at length he\nfound a pleasure in satisfying his curiosity, which so much pleased the\nyoung prisoner, that, as a great condescension, he invited him to come\nout on the roof of the tower and drink sherbet with him in the cool of\nthe evening, and tell him of the country beyond the desert, and what\nseas are like, and mountains, and towns.\n\n"I have learnt much from my attendants, and know this world pretty\nwell by hearsay," said the prince, as they reclined on the rich carpet\nwhich was spread on the roof.\n\nThe old man smiled, but did not answer; perhaps because he did not\ncare to undeceive his young companion, perhaps because so many slaves\nwere present, some of whom were serving them with fruit, and others\nburning rich odors on a little chafing-dish that stood between them.\n\n"But there are some words to which I never could attach any\nparticular meaning," proceeded the prince, as the slaves began to\nretire, "and three in particular that my attendants cannot satisfy me\nupon, or are reluctant to do so."\n\n"What words are those, my prince?" asked the old man. The prince\nturned on his elbow to be sure that the last slave had descended the\ntower stairs, then replied—\n\n"O man of much knowledge, the words are these—Labor, and Liberty, and\nGold."\n\n"Prince," said the old man, "I do not wonder that it has been hard to\nmake thee understand the first, the nature of it, and the cause why most\nmen are born to it; as for the second, it would be treason for thee and\nme to do more than whisper it here, and sigh for it when none are\nlistening; but the third need hardly puzzle thee, thy hookah is bright\nwith it; all thy jewels are set in it; gold is inlaid in the ivory of\nthy bath; thy cup and thy dish are of gold, and golden threads are\nwrought into thy raiment."\n\n"That is true," replied the prince, "and if I had not seen and\nhandled this gold, perhaps I might not find its merits so hard to\nunderstand; but I possess it in abundance, and it does not feed me, nor\nmake music for me, nor fan me when the sun is hot, nor cause me to sleep\nwhen I am weary; therefore when my slaves have told me how merchants go\nout and brave the perilous wind and sea, and live in the unstable ships,\nand run risks from shipwreck and pirates, and when, having asked them\nwhy they have done this, they have answered, \'For gold,\' I have found it\nhard to believe them; and when they have told me how men have lied, and\nrobbed, and deceived; how they have murdered one another, and leagued\ntogether to depose kings, to oppress provinces, and all for gold; then I\nhave said to myself, either my slaves have combined to make me believe\nthat which is not, or this gold must be very different from the yellow\nstuff that this coin is made of, this coin which is of no use but to\nhave a hole pierced through it and hang to my girdle, that it may tinkle\nwhen I walk."\n\n"Notwithstanding," said the old man, "nothing can be done without\ngold; for look you, prince, it is better than bread, and fruit, and\nmusic, for it can buy them all, since men love it, and have agreed to\nexchange it for whatever they may need."\n\n"How so?" asked the prince.\n\n"If a man has many loaves he cannot eat them all," answered the old\nman; "therefore he goes to his neighbor and 230 says,\n\'I have bread and thou hast a coin of gold—let us change\'; so he\nreceives the gold and goes to another man, saying, \'Thou hast two houses\nand I have none; lend me one of thy houses to live in, and I will give\nthee my gold\'; thus again they change, and he that has the gold says, \'I\nhave food enough and goods enough, but I want a wife, I will go to the\nmerchant and get a marriage gift for her father, and for it I will give\nhim this gold.\'"\n\n"It is well," said the prince; "but in time of drought, if there is\nno bread in a city, can they make it of gold?"\n\n"Not so," answered the old man, "but they must send their gold to a\ncity where there is food, and bring that back instead of it."\n\n"But if there was a famine all over the world," asked the prince,\n"what would they do then?"\n\n"Why then, and only then," said the old man, "they must starve, and\nthe gold would be nought, for it can only be changed for that which\nis; it cannot make that which is not."\n\n"And where do they get gold?" asked the prince; "is it the precious\nfruit of some rare tree, or have they whereby they can draw it down from\nthe sky at sunset?"\n\n"Some of it," said the old man, "they dig out of the ground."\n\nThen he told the prince of ancient rivers running through terrible\ndeserts, whose sands glitter, with golden grains and are yellow in the\nfierce heat of the sun, and of dreary mines where the Indian slaves work\nin gangs tied together, never seeing the light of day; and lastly (for\nhe was a man of much knowledge, and had traveled far), he told him of\nthe valley of the Sacramento in the New World, and of those mountains\nwhere the people of Europe send their criminals, and where now their\nfree men pour forth to gather gold, and dig for it as hard as if for\nlife; sitting up by it at night lest any should take it from them,\ngiving up houses and country, and wife and children, for the sake of a\nfew feet of mud, whence they dig clay that glitters as they wash it; and\nhow they sift it and rock it as patiently as if it were their own\nchildren in the cradle, and afterwards carry it in their bosoms, and\nforego on account of it safety and rest.\n\n"But, prince," he proceeded, observing that the young man was\nabsorbed in his narrative, "if you would pass your word to me never to\nbetray me, I would procure for you a sight of the external world, and in\na trance you should see those places where gold is dug, and traverse\nthose regions forbidden to your mortal footsteps."\n\nUpon this, the prince threw himself at the old man\'s feet, and\npromised heartily to observe the secrecy required, and entreated that,\nfor however short time, he might be suffered to see this wonderful\nworld.\n\nThen, if we may credit the story, the old man drew nearer to the\nchafing-dish which stood between them, and having fanned the dying\nembers in it, cast upon them a certain powder and some herbs, from\nwhence as they burnt a peculiar smoke arose. As their vapors spread, he\ndesired the prince to draw near and inhale them, and then (says the\nfable) when he should sleep he should find himself, in his dream, at\nwhatever place he might desire, with this strange advantage, that he\nshould see things in their truth and reality as well as in their outward\nshows.\n\nSo the prince, not without some fear, prepared to obey; but first he\ndrank his 231 sherbet, and handed over the golden cup to the\nold man by way of recompense; then he reclined beside the chafing-dish\nand inhaled the heavy perfume till he became overpowered with sleep, and\nsank down upon the carpet in a dream.\n\nThe prince knew not where he was, but a green country was floating\nbefore him, and he found himself standing in a marshy valley, where a\nfew wretched cottages were scattered here and there with no means of\ncommunication. There was a river, but it had overflowed its banks and\nmade the central land impassable, the fences had been broken down by it,\nand the fields of corn laid low; a few wretched peasants were wandering\nabout there; they looked half clad and half starved. "A miserable valley\nindeed!" exclaimed the prince; but as he said it a man came down from\nthe hills with a great bag of gold in his hand.\n\n"This valley is mine," said he to the people; "I have bought it for\ngold. Now make banks that the river may not overflow, and I will give\nyou gold; also make fences and plant fields, and cover in the roofs of\nyour houses, and buy yourselves richer clothing." So the people did so,\nand as the gold got lower in the bag the valley grew fairer and greener,\ntill the prince exclaimed, "O gold, I see your value now! O wonderful,\nbeneficent gold!"\n\nBut presently the valley melted away like a mist, and the prince saw\nan army besieging a city; he heard a general haranguing his soldiers to\nurge them on, and the soldiers shouting and battering the walls; but\nshortly, when the city was well-nigh taken, he saw some men secretly\nthrowing gold among the soldiers, so much of it that they threw down\ntheir arms to pick it up, and said that the walls were so strong that\nthey could not throw them down. "O powerful gold!" thought the prince;\n"thou art stronger than the city walls!"\n\nAfter that it seemed to himself that he was walking about in a desert\ncountry, and in his dream he thought, "Now I know what labor is, for I\nhave seen it, and its benefits; and I know what liberty is, for I have\ntasted it; I can wander where I will, and no man questions me; but gold\nis more strange to me than ever, for I have seen it buy both liberty and\nlabor." Shortly after this he saw a great crowd digging upon a barren\nhill, and when he drew near he understood that he had reached the summit\nof his wishes, and that he was to see the place where the gold came\nfrom.\n\nHe came up and stood a long time watching the people as they toiled\nready to faint in the sun, so great was the labor of digging the\ngold.\n\nHe saw who had much and could not trust any one to help them to carry\nit, binding it in bundles over their shoulders, and bending and groaning\nunder its weight; he saw others hide it in the ground, and watch the\nplace clothed in rags, that none might suspect that they were rich; but\nsome, on the contrary, who had dug up an unusual quantity, he saw\ndancing and singing, and vaunting their success, till robbers waylaid\nthem when they slept, and rifled their bundles and carried their golden\nsand away.\n\n"All these men are mad," thought the prince, "and this pernicious\ngold has made them so."\n\nAfter this, as he wandered here and there, he saw groups of people\nsmelting the gold under the shadow of the trees, and he observed that a\ndancing, quivering vapor rose up from it, which dazzled their 232 eyes,\nand distorted everything that they looked at; arraying it also in\ndifferent colors from the true one. He observed that this vapor from the\ngold caused all things to rock and reel before the eyes of those who\nlooked through it, and also, by some strange affinity, it drew their\nhearts towards those that carried much gold on their persons, so that\nthey called them good and beautiful; it also caused them to see darkness\nand dullness in the faces of those who carried none. "This," thought the\nprince, "is very strange"; but not being able to explain it, he went\nstill further, and there he saw more people. Each of these had adorned\nhimself with a broad golden girdle, and was sitting in the shade, while\nother men waited on them.\n\n"What ails these people?" he inquired of one who was looking on, for\nhe observed a peculiar air of weariness and dullness in their faces. He\nwas answered that the girdles were very tight and heavy, and being bound\nover the regions of the heart, were supposed to impede its action, and\nprevent it from beating high, and also to chill the wearer, as being of\nopaque material, the warm sunshine of the earth could not get through to\nwarm him.\n\n"Why, then, do they not break them asunder," exclaimed the prince,\n"and fling them away?"\n\n"Break them asunder!" cried the man; "why what a madman you must be;\nthey are made of the purest gold!"\n\n"Forgive my ignorance," replied the prince; "I am a stranger."\n\nSo he walked on, for feelings of delicacy prevented him from gazing\nany longer at the men with the golden girdles; but as he went he\npondered on the misery he had seen, and thought to himself that this\ngolden sand did more mischief than all the poisons of the apothecary;\nfor it dazzled the eyes of some, it strained the hearts of others, it\nbowed down the heads of many to the earth with its weight; it was a sore\nlabor to gather it, and when it was gathered, the robber might carry it\naway; it would be a good thing, he thought, if there were none of\nit.\n\nAfter this he came to a place where were sitting some aged widows and\nsome orphan children of the gold-diggers, who were helpless and\ndestitute; they were weeping and bemoaning themselves, but stopped at\nthe approach of a man, whose appearance attracted the prince, for he had\na very great bundle of gold on his back, and yet it did not bow him down\nat all; his apparel was rich but he had no girdle on, and his face was\nanything but sad.\n\n"Sir," said the prince to him, "you have a great burden; you are\nfortunate to be able to stand under it."\n\n"I could not do so," he replied, "only that as I go on I keep\nlightening it"; and as he passed each of the widows, he threw gold to\nher, and stooping down, hid pieces of it in the bosoms of the\nchildren.\n\n"You have no girdle," said the prince.\n\n"I once had one," answered the gold gatherer; "but it was so tight\nover my breast that my very heart grew cold under it, and almost ceased\nto beat. Having a great quantity of gold on my back, I felt almost at\nthe last gasp; so I threw off my girdle and being on the bank of a\nriver, which I knew not how to cross, I was about to fling it in, I was\nso vexed! \'But no,\' thought I, \'there are many people waiting here to\ncross besides myself. I will make my girdle into a bridge, and we will\ncross over on it.\'"\n\n"Turn your girdle into a bridge!" exclaimed the prince doubtfully,\nfor he did not quite understand.\n\nThe man explained himself. 233\n\n"And then, sir, after that," he continued, "I turned one half of my\nburden into bread, and gave it to these poor people. Since then I have\nnot been oppressed by its weight, however heavy it may have been; for\nfew men have a heavier one. In fact, I gather more from day to day."\n\nAs the man kept speaking, he scattered his gold right and left with a\ncheerful countenance, and the prince was about to reply, when suddenly a\ngreat trembling under his feet made him fall to the ground. The refining\nfires of the gold gatherers sprang up into flames, and then went out;\nnight fell over everything on the earth, and nothing was visible in the\nsky but the stars of the southern cross, which were glittering above\nhim.\n\n"It is past midnight," thought the prince, "for the stars of the\ncross begin to bend."\n\nHe raised himself upon his elbow, and tried to pierce the darkness,\nbut could not. At length a slender blue flame darted out, as from ashes\nin a chafing-dish, and by the light of it he saw the strange pattern of\nhis carpet and the cushions lying about. He did not recognise them at\nfirst, but presently he knew that he was lying in his usual place, at\nthe top of his tower.\n\n"Wake up, prince," said the old man.\n\nThe prince sat up and sighed, and the old man inquired what he had\nseen.\n\n"O man of much learning!" answered the prince, "I have seen that this\nis a wonderful world; I have seen the value of labor, and I know the\nuses of it; I have tasted the sweetness of liberty, and am grateful,\nthough it was but in a dream; but as for that other word that was so\ngreat a mystery to me, I only know this, that it must remain a mystery\nforever, since I am fain to believe that all men are bent on getting it;\nthough, once gotten, it causeth them endless disquietude, only second to\ntheir discomfort that are without it. I am fain to believe that they can\nprocure with it whatever they most desire, and yet that it cankers their\nhearts and dazzles their eyes; that it is their nature and their duty to\ngather it; and yet that, when once gathered, the best thing they can do\nis to scatter it!"\n\nAlas! the prince visited this wonderful world no more; for the next\nmorning, when he awoke, the old man was gone. He had taken with him the\ngolden cup which the prince had given him. And the sentinel was also\ngone, none knew whither. Perhaps the old man had turned his golden cup\ninto a golden key.\n\n203\n\nFew modern writers have given their readers more genuine delight than\nFrank R. Stockton (1834-1902). The most absurd and illogical situations\nand characters are presented with an air of such quiet sincerity that\none refuses to question the reality of it all. Rudder\nGrange established his reputation in 1879, and was followed by a\nlong list of stories of delightfully impossible events. For several\nyears Stockton was one of the editors of St. Nicholas, and\nsome of his stories for children, of first quality in both form and\ncontent, deserve to be better known than they are. Five of the best of\nthem for school use have been brought together in a little volume called\nFanciful Tales. One of these, "Old Pipes and the Dryad," is\ngiven here by permission of the publishers, Charles Scribner\'s Sons, New\nYork. (Copyright, 1894.) This story is based upon the old mythical\nbelief that the trees are inhabited by guardian deities known as dryads,\nor hamadryads. To injure a tree meant to injure its guardian spirit and\nwas almost certain to insure 234 disaster for the guilty person.\nOn the other hand, to protect a tree would bring some token of\nappreciation from the dryad. A good introduction to the story would be\nthe telling of one or two of these tree myths as found in Gayley\'s\nClassic Myths or Bulfinch\'s Age of Fable. A\nfine literary version of one of them is in Lowell\'s "Rhoecus." But the\nbeautiful and kindly helpfulness of Old Pipes will carry its own message\nwhether one knows any mythology or not.\n\nOLD PIPES AND THE DRYAD\n\nFRANK R. STOCKTON\n\nA Mountain brook ran through a little village. Over the brook there\nwas a narrow bridge, and from the bridge a foot-path led out from the\nvillage and up the hill-side, to the cottage of Old Pipes and his\nmother.\n\nFor many, many years Old Pipes had been employed by the villagers to\npipe the cattle down from the hills. Every afternoon, an hour before\nsunset, he would sit on a rock in front of his cottage and play on his\npipes. Then all the flocks and herds that were grazing on the mountains\nwould hear him, wherever they might happen to be, and would come down to\nthe village—the cows by the easiest paths, the sheep by those not quite\nso easy, and the goats by the steep and rocky ways that were hardest of\nall.\n\nBut now, for a year or more, Old Pipes had not piped the cattle home.\nIt is true that every afternoon he sat upon the rock and played upon his\npipes; but the cattle did not hear him. He had grown old, and his breath\nwas feeble. The echoes of his cheerful notes, which used to come from\nthe rocky hill on the other side of the valley, were heard no more; and\ntwenty yards from Old Pipes one could scarcely tell what tune he was\nplaying. He had become somewhat deaf, and did not know that the sound of\nhis pipes was so thin and weak, and that the cattle did not hear him.\nThe cows, the sheep, and the goats came down every afternoon as before;\nbut this was because two boys and a girl were sent up after them. The\nvillagers did not wish the good old man to know that his piping was no\nlonger of any use; so they paid him his little salary every month, and\nsaid nothing about the two boys and the girl.\n\nOld Pipes\'s mother was, of course, a great deal older than he was,\nand was as deaf as a gate—post, latch, hinges, and all—and she never\nknew that the sound of her son\'s pipe did not spread over all the\nmountain-side and echo back strong and clear from the opposite hills.\nShe was very fond of Old Pipes, and proud of his piping; and as he was\nso much younger than she was, she never thought of him as being very\nold. She cooked for him, and made his bed, and mended his clothes; and\nthey lived very comfortably on his little salary.\n\nOne afternoon, at the end of the month, when Old Pipes had finished\nhis piping, he took his stout staff and went down the hill to the\nvillage to receive the money for his month\'s work. The path seemed a\ngreat deal steeper and more difficult than it used to be; and Old Pipes\nthought that it must have been washed by the rains and greatly damaged.\nHe remembered it as a path that was quite easy to traverse either up or\ndown. But Old Pipes had been a very active man, and as his mother was so\nmuch older than he was, he never thought of himself as aged and infirm.\n235\n\nWhen the Chief Villager had paid him, and he had talked a little with\nsome of his friends, Old Pipes started to go home. But when he had\ncrossed the bridge over the brook, and gone a short distance up the\nhill-side, he became very tired, and sat down upon a stone. He had not\nbeen sitting there half a minute, when along came two boys and a\ngirl.\n\n"Children," said Old Pipes, "I\'m very tired to-night, and I don\'t\nbelieve I can climb up this steep path to my home. I think I shall have\nto ask you to help me."\n\n"We will do that," said the boys and the girl, quite cheerfully; and\none boy took him by the right hand and the other by the left, while the\ngirl pushed him in the back. In this way he went up the hill quite\neasily, and soon reached his cottage door. Old Pipes gave each of the\nthree children a copper coin, and then they sat down for a few minutes\'\nrest before starting back to the village.\n\n"I\'m sorry that I tired you so much," said Old Pipes.\n\n"Oh, that would not have tired us," said one of the boys, "if we had\nnot been so far to-day after the cows, the sheep, and the goats. They\nrambled high up on the mountain, and we never before had such a time in\nfinding them."\n\n"Had to go after the cows, the sheep, and the goats!" exclaimed Old\nPipes. "What do you mean by that?"\n\nThe girl, who stood behind the old man, shook her head, put her hand\non her mouth, and made all sorts of signs to the boy to stop talking on\nthis subject; but he did not notice her, and promptly answered Old\nPipes.\n\n"Why, you see, good sir," said he, "that as the cattle can\'t hear\nyour pipes now, somebody has to go after them every evening to drive\nthem down from the mountain, and the Chief Villager has hired us three\nto do it. Generally it is not very hard work, but to-night the cattle\nhad wandered far."\n\n"How long have you been doing this?" asked the old man.\n\nThe girl shook her head and clapped her hand on her mouth as before,\nbut the boy went on.\n\n"I think it is about a year now," he said, "since the people first\nfelt sure that the cattle could not hear your pipes; and from that time\nwe\'ve been driving them down. But we are rested now, and will go home.\nGood-night, sir."\n\nThe three children then went down the hill, the girl scolding the boy\nall the way home. Old Pipes stood silent a few moments, and then he went\ninto his cottage.\n\n"Mother," he shouted, "did you hear what those children said?"\n\n"Children!" exclaimed the old woman; "I did not hear them. I did not\nknow there were any children here."\n\nThen Old Pipes told his mother—shouting very loudly to make her\nhear—how the two boys and the girl had helped him up the hill, and what\nhe had heard about his piping and the cattle.\n\n"They can\'t hear you?" cried his mother. "Why, what\'s the matter with\nthe cattle?"\n\n"Ah, me!" said Old Pipes; "I don\'t believe there\'s anything the\nmatter with the cattle. It must be with me and my pipes that there is\nsomething the matter. But one thing is certain: if I do not earn the\nwages the Chief Villager pays me, I shall not take them. I shall go\nstraight down to the village and give back the money I received to-day."\n236\n\n"Nonsense!" cried his mother. "I\'m sure you\'ve piped as well as you\ncould, and no more can be expected. And what are we to do without the\nmoney?"\n\n"I don\'t know," said Old Pipes; "but I\'m going down to the village to\npay it back."\n\nThe sun had now set; but the moon was shining very brightly on the\nhill-side, and Old Pipes could see his way very well. He did not take\nthe same path by which he had gone before, but followed another, which\nled among the trees upon the hill-side, and, though longer, was not so\nsteep.\n\nWhen he had gone about half-way, the old man sat down to rest,\nleaning his back against a great oak tree. As he did so, he heard a\nsound like knocking inside the tree, and then a voice said:\n\n"Let me out! let me out!"\n\nOld Pipes instantly forgot that he was tired, and sprang to his feet.\n"This must be a Dryad tree!" he exclaimed. "If it is, I\'ll let her\nout."\n\nOld Pipes had never, to his knowledge, seen a Dryad tree, but he knew\nthere were such trees on the hill-sides and the mountains, and that\nDryads lived in them. He knew, too, that in the summer time, on those\ndays when the moon rose before the sun went down, a Dryad could come out\nof her tree if any one could find the key which locked her in, and turn\nit. Old Pipes closely examined the trunk of the tree, which stood in the\nfull moonlight. "If I see that key," he said, "I shall surely turn it."\nBefore long he found a piece of bark standing out from the tree, which\nlooked to him very much like the handle of a key. He took hold of it,\nand found he could turn it quite around. As he did so, a large part of\nthe side of the tree was pushed open, and a beautiful Dryad stepped quickly\nout.\n\nTranscriber\'s Note: original reads \'Dyrad\'\n\nFor a moment she stood motionless, gazing on the scene before her—the\ntranquil valley, the hills, the forest, and the mountain-side, all lying\nin the soft clear light of the moon. "Oh, lovely! lovely!" she\nexclaimed. "How long it is since I have seen anything like this!" And\nthen, turning to Old Pipes, she said: "How good of you to let me out! I\nam so happy, and so thankful, that I must kiss you, you dear old man!"\nAnd she threw her arms around the neck of Old Pipes, and kissed him on\nboth cheeks.\n\n"You don\'t know," she then went on to say, "how doleful it is to be\nshut up so long in a tree. I don\'t mind it in the winter, for then I am\nglad to be sheltered, but in summer it is a rueful thing not to be able\nto see all the beauties of the world. And it\'s ever so long since I\'ve\nbeen let out. People so seldom come this way; and when they do come at\nthe right time, they either don\'t hear me or they are frightened and run\naway. But you, you dear old man, you were not frightened, and you looked\nand looked for the key, and you let me out; and now I shall not have to\ngo back till winter has come, and the air grows cold. Oh, it is\nglorious! What can I do for you, to show you how grateful I am?"\n\n"I am very glad," said Old Pipes, "that I let you out, since I see\nthat it makes you so happy; but I must admit that I tried to find the\nkey because I had a great desire to see a Dryad. But, if you wish to do\nsomething for me, you can, if you happen to be going down toward the\nvillage."\n\n"To the village!" exclaimed the Dryad. 237 "I will go anywhere for you, my\nkind old benefactor."\n\n"Well, then," said Old Pipes, "I wish you would take this little bag\nof money to the Chief Villager and tell him that Old Pipes cannot\nreceive pay for the services which he does not perform. It is now more\nthan a year that I have not been able to make the cattle hear me, when I\npiped to call them home. I did not know this until to-night; but now\nthat I know it, I cannot keep the money, and so I send it back." And,\nhanding the little bag to the Dryad, he bade her good-night, and turned\ntoward his cottage.\n\n"Good-night," said the Dryad. "And I thank you over, and over, and\nover again, you good old man!"\n\nOld Pipes walked toward his home, very glad to be saved the fatigue\nof going all the way down to the village and back again. "To be sure,"\nhe said to himself, "this path does not seem at all steep, and I can\nwalk along it very easily; but it would have tired me dreadfully to come\nup all the way from the village, especially as I could not have expected\nthose children to help me again." When he reached home his mother was\nsurprised to see him returning so soon.\n\n"What!" she exclaimed; "have you already come back? What did the\nChief Villager say? Did he take the money?"\n\nOld Pipes was just about to tell her that he had sent the money to\nthe village by a Dryad, when he suddenly reflected that his mother would\nbe sure to disapprove such a proceeding, and so he merely said he had\nsent it by a person whom he had met.\n\n"And how do you know that the person will ever take it to the Chief\nVillager?" cried his mother. "You will lose it, and the villagers will\nnever get it. Oh, Pipes! Pipes! when will you be old enough to have\nordinary common-sense?"\n\nOld Pipes considered that, as he was already seventy years of age, he\ncould scarcely expect to grow any wiser; but he made no remark on this\nsubject, and, saying that he doubted not that the money would go safely\nto its destination, he sat down to his supper. His mother scolded him\nroundly, but he did not mind it; and after supper he went out and sat on\na rustic chair in front of the cottage to look at the moonlit village,\nand to wonder whether or not the Chief Villager really received the\nmoney. While he was doing these two things, he went fast asleep.\n\nWhen Old Pipes left the Dryad, she did not go down to the village\nwith the little bag of money. She held it in her hand, and thought about\nwhat she had heard. "This is a good and honest old man," she said; "and\nit is a shame that he should lose this money. He looked as if he needed\nit, and I don\'t believe the people in the village will take it from one\nwho has served them so long. Often, when in my tree, have I heard the\nsweet notes of his pipes. I am going to take the money back to him." She\ndid not start immediately, because there were so many beautiful things\nto look at; but after awhile she went up to the cottage, and, finding\nOld Pipes asleep in his chair, she slipped the little bag into his\ncoat-pocket, and silently sped away.\n\nThe next day Old Pipes told his mother that he would go up the\nmountain and cut some wood. He had a right to get wood from the\nmountain, but for a long time he had been content to pick up the dead\nbranches which lay about his cottage. To-day, however, he felt so strong\nand vigorous that he thought he would 238 go and cut some fuel that would\nbe better than this. He worked all the morning, and when he came back he\ndid not feel at all tired, and he had a very good appetite for his\ndinner.\n\nNow, Old Pipes knew a good deal about Dryads; but there was one thing\nwhich, although he had heard, he had forgotten. This was, that a kiss\nfrom a Dryad made a person ten years younger.\n\nThe people of the village knew this, and they were very careful not\nto let any child of ten years or younger go into the woods where the\nDryads were supposed to be; for, if they should chance to be kissed by\none of these tree-nymphs, they would be set back so far that they would\ncease to exist.\n\nA story was told in the village that a very bad boy of eleven once\nran away into the woods, and had an adventure of this kind; and when his\nmother found him he was a little baby of one year old. Taking advantage\nof her opportunity, she brought him up more carefully than she had done\nbefore, and he grew to be a very good boy indeed.\n\nNow Old Pipes had been kissed twice by the Dryad, once on each cheek,\nand he therefore felt as vigorous and active as when he was a hale man\nof fifty. His mother noticed how much work he was doing, and told him\nthat he need not try in that way to make up for the loss of his piping\nwages; for he would only tire himself out, and get sick. But her son\nanswered that he had not felt so well for years, and that he was quite\nable to work.\n\nIn the course of the afternoon, Old Pipes, for the first time that\nday, put his hand in his coat-pocket, and there, to his amazement, he\nfound the little bag of money. "Well, well!" he exclaimed, "I am stupid,\nindeed! I really thought that I had seen a Dryad; but when I sat down by\nthat big oak tree I must have gone to sleep and dreamed it all; and then\nI came home, thinking I had given the money to a Dryad, when it was in\nmy pocket all the time. But the Chief Villager shall have the money. I\nshall not take it to him to-day, but to-morrow I wish to go to the\nvillage to see some of my old friends; and then I shall give up the\nmoney."\n\nToward the close of the afternoon, Old Pipes, as had been his custom\nfor so many years, took his pipes from the shelf on which they lay, and\nwent out to the rock in front of the cottage.\n\n"What are you going to do?" cried his mother. "If you will not\nconsent to be paid, why do you pipe?"\n\n"I am going to pipe for my own pleasure," said her son. "I am used to\nit, and I do not wish to give it up. It does not matter now whether the\ncattle hear me or not, and I am sure that my piping will injure no\none."\n\nWhen the good man began to play upon his favorite instrument he was\nastonished at the sound that came from it. The beautiful notes of the\npipes sounded clear and strong down into the valley, and spread over the\nhills, and up the sides of the mountain beyond, while, after a little\ninterval, an echo came back from the rocky hill on the other side of the\nvalley.\n\n"Ha! ha!" he cried, "what has happened to my pipes? They must have\nbeen stopped up of late, but now they are as clear and good as\never."\n\nAgain the merry notes went sounding far and wide. The cattle on the\nmountain heard them, and those that were old enough remembered how these\nnotes had called them from their pastures 239 every evening, and so they\nstarted down the mountain-side, the others following.\n\nThe merry notes were heard in the village below, and the people were\nmuch astonished thereby. "Why, who can be blowing the pipes of Old\nPipes?" they said. But, as they were all very busy, no one went up to\nsee. One thing, however, was plain enough: the cattle were coming down\nthe mountain. And so the two boys and the girl did not have to go after\nthem, and had an hour for play, for which they were very glad.\n\nThe next morning Old Pipes started down to the village with his\nmoney, and on the way he met the Dryad. "Oh, ho!" he cried, "is that\nyou? Why, I thought my letting you out of the tree was nothing but a\ndream."\n\n"A dream!" cried the Dryad; "if you only knew how happy you have made\nme, you would not think it merely a dream. And has it not benefited you?\nDo you not feel happier? Yesterday I heard you playing beautifully on\nyour pipes."\n\n"Yes, yes," cried he. "I did not understand it before, but I see it\nall now. I have really grown younger. I thank you, I thank you, good\nDryad, from the bottom of my heart. It was the finding of the money in\nmy pocket that made me think it was a dream."\n\n"Oh, I put it in when you were asleep," she said, laughing, "because\nI thought you ought to keep it. Good-by, kind, honest man. May you live\nlong, and be as happy as I am now."\n\nOld Pipes was greatly delighted when he understood that he was really\na younger man; but that made no difference about the money, and he kept\non his way to the village. As soon as he reached it, he was eagerly\nquestioned as to who had been playing his pipes the evening before, and\nwhen the people heard that it was himself they were very much surprised.\nThereupon Old Pipes told what had happened to him, and then there was\ngreater wonder, with hearty congratulations and hand-shakes; for Old\nPipes was liked by everyone. The Chief Villager refused to take his\nmoney; and although Old Pipes said that he had not earned it, everyone\npresent insisted that, as he would now play on his pipes as before, he\nshould lose nothing because, for a time, he was unable to perform his\nduty.\n\nSo Old Pipes was obliged to keep his money, and after an hour or two\nspent in conversation with his friends he returned to his cottage.\n\nThere was one person, however, who was not pleased with what had\nhappened to Old Pipes. This was an Echo-dwarf who lived on the hills\nacross the valley. It was his work to echo back the notes of the pipes\nwhenever they could be heard.\n\nA great many other Echo-dwarfs lived on these hills. They all worked,\nbut in different ways. Some echoed back the songs of maidens, some the\nshouts of children, and others the music that was often heard in the\nvillage. But there was only one who could send back the strong notes of\nthe pipes of Old Pipes, and this had been his sole duty for many years.\nBut when the old man grew feeble, and the notes of his pipes could not\nbe heard on the opposite hills, this Echo-dwarf had nothing to do, and\nhe spent his time in delightful idleness; and he slept so much and grew\nso fat that it made his companions laugh to see him walk. 240\n\nOn the afternoon on which, after so long an interval, the sound of\nthe pipes was heard on the echo hills, this dwarf was fast asleep behind\na rock. As soon as the first notes reached them, some of his companions\nran to wake him up. Rolling to his feet, he echoed back the merry tune\nof Old Pipes.\n\nNaturally, he was very angry at being thus obliged to give up his\nlife of comfort, and he hoped very much that this pipe-playing would not\noccur again. The next afternoon he was awake and listening, and, sure\nenough, at the usual hour, along came the notes of the pipes as clear\nand strong as they ever had been; and he was obliged to work as long as\nOld Pipes played. The Echo-dwarf was very angry. He had supposed, of\ncourse, that the pipe-playing had ceased forever, and he felt that he\nhad a right to be indignant at being thus deceived. He was so much\ndisturbed that he made up his mind to go and try to find out how long\nthis was to last. He had plenty of time, as the pipes were played but\nonce a day, and he set off early in the morning for the hill on which\nOld Pipes lived. It was hard work for the fat little fellow, and when he\nhad crossed the valley and had gone some distance into the woods on the\nhill-side, he stopped to rest, and in a few minutes the Dryad came\ntripping along.\n\n"Ho, ho!" exclaimed the dwarf; "what are you doing here? and how did\nyou get out of your tree?"\n\n"Doing!" cried the Dryad; "I am being happy; that\'s what I am doing.\nAnd I was let out of my tree by the good old man who plays the pipes to\ncall the cattle down from the mountain. And it makes me happier to think\nthat I have been of service to him. I gave him two kisses of gratitude,\nand now he is young enough to play his pipes as well as ever."\n\nThe Echo-dwarf stepped forward, his face pale with passion. "Am I to\nbelieve," he said, "that you are the cause of this great evil that has\ncome upon me? and that you are the wicked creature who has again started\nthis old man upon his career of pipe-playing? What have I ever done to\nyou that you should have condemned me for years and years to echo back\nthe notes of those wretched pipes?"\n\nAt this the Dryad laughed loudly.\n\n"What a funny little fellow you are!" she said. "Anyone would think\nyou had been condemned to toil from morning till night; while what you\nreally have to do is merely to imitate for half an hour every day the\nmerry notes of Old Pipes\'s piping. Fie upon you, Echo-dwarf! You are\nlazy and selfish; and that is what is the matter with you. Instead of\ngrumbling at being obliged to do a little wholesome work, which is less,\nI am sure, than that of any other echo-dwarf upon the rocky hill-side,\nyou should rejoice at the good fortune of the old man who has regained\nso much of his strength and vigor. Go home and learn to be just and\ngenerous; and then, perhaps, you may be happy. Good-by."\n\n"Insolent creature!" shouted the dwarf, as he shook his fat little\nfist at her. "I\'ll make you suffer for this. You shall find out what it\nis to heap injury and insult upon one like me, and to snatch from him\nthe repose that he has earned by long years of toil." And, shaking his\nhead savagely, he hurried back to the rocky hill-side.\n\nEvery afternoon the merry notes of 241 the pipes of Old Pipes sounded\ndown into the valley and over the hills and up the mountain-side; and\nevery afternoon when he had echoed them back, the little dwarf grew more\nand more angry with the Dryad. Each day, from early morning till it was\ntime for him to go back to his duties upon the rocky hill-side, he\nsearched the woods for her. He intended, if he met her, to pretend to be\nvery sorry for what he had said, and he thought he might be able to play\na trick upon her which would avenge him well.\n\nOne day, while thus wandering among the trees, he met Old Pipes. The\nEcho-dwarf did not generally care to see or speak to ordinary people;\nbut now he was so anxious to find the object of his search, that he\nstopped and asked Old Pipes if he had seen the Dryad. The piper had not\nnoticed the little fellow, and he looked down on him with some\nsurprise.\n\n"No," he said; "I have not seen her, and I have been looking\neverywhere for her."\n\n"You!" cried the dwarf, "what do you wish with her?"\n\nOld Pipes then sat down on a stone, so that he should be nearer the\near of his small companion, and he told what the Dryad had done for\nhim.\n\nWhen the Echo-dwarf heard that this was the man whose pipes he was\nobliged to echo back every day, he would have slain him on the spot, had\nhe been able; but, as he was not able, he merely ground his teeth and\nlistened to the rest of the story.\n\n"I am looking for the Dryad now," Old Pipes continued, "on account of\nmy aged mother. When I was old myself, I did not notice how very old my\nmother was; but now it shocks me to see how feeble her years have caused\nher to become; and I am looking for the Dryad to ask her to make my\nmother younger, as she made me."\n\nThe eyes of the Echo-dwarf glistened. Here was a man who might help\nhim in his plans.\n\n"Your idea is a good one," he said to Old Pipes, "and it does you\nhonor. But you should know that a Dryad can make no person younger but\none who lets her out of her tree. However, you can manage the affair\nvery easily. All you need do is to find the Dryad, tell her what you\nwant, and request her to step into her tree and be shut up for a short\ntime. Then you will go and bring your mother to the tree; she will open\nit, and everything will be as you wish. Is not this a good plan?"\n\n"Excellent!" cried Old Pipes; "and I will go instantly and search\nmore diligently for the Dryad."\n\n"Take me with you," said the Echo-dwarf. "You can easily carry me on\nyour strong shoulders; and I shall be glad to help you in any way that I\ncan."\n\n"Now then," said the little fellow to himself, as Old Pipes carried\nhim rapidly along, "if he persuades the Dryad to get into a tree,—and\nshe is quite foolish enough to do it,—and then goes away to bring his\nmother, I shall take a stone or a club and I will break off the key of\nthat tree, so that nobody can ever turn it again. Then Mistress Dryad\nwill see what she has brought upon herself by her behavior to me."\n\nBefore long they came to the great oak tree in which the Dryad had\nlived, and at a distance they saw that beautiful creature herself coming\ntoward them.\n\n"How excellently well everything happens!" said the dwarf. "Put me\ndown, 242 and I will go. Your business with the Dryad is\nmore important than mine; and you need not say anything about my having\nsuggested your plan to you. I am willing that you should have all the\ncredit of it yourself."\n\nOld Pipes put the Echo-dwarf upon the ground, but the little rogue\ndid not go away. He hid himself between some low, mossy rocks, and he\nwas so much like them in color that you would not have noticed him if\nyou had been looking straight at him.\n\nWhen the Dryad came up, Old Pipes lost no time in telling her about\nhis mother, and what he wished her to do. At first, the Dryad answered\nnothing, but stood looking very sadly at Old Pipes.\n\n"Do you really wish me to go into my tree again?" she said. "I should\ndreadfully dislike to do it, for I don\'t know what might happen. It is\nnot at all necessary, for I could make your mother younger at any time\nif she would give me the opportunity. I had already thought of making\nyou still happier in this way, and several times I have waited about\nyour cottage, hoping to meet your aged mother, but she never comes\noutside, and you know a Dryad cannot enter a house. I cannot imagine\nwhat put this idea into your head. Did you think of it yourself?"\n\n"No, I cannot say that I did," answered Old Pipes. "A little dwarf\nwhom I met in the woods proposed it to me."\n\n"Oh!" cried the Dryad; "now I see through it all. It is the scheme of\nthat vile Echo-dwarf—your enemy and mine. Where is he? I should like to\nsee him."\n\n"I think he has gone away," said Old Pipes.\n\n"No, he has not," said the Dryad, whose quick eyes perceived the\nEcho-dwarf among the rocks, "there he is. Seize him and drag him out, I\nbeg of you."\n\nOld Pipes saw the dwarf as soon as he was pointed out to him; and\nrunning to the rocks, he caught the little fellow by the arm and pulled\nhim out.\n\n"Now, then," cried the Dryad, who had opened the door of the great\noak, "just stick him in there, and we will shut him up. Then I shall be\nsafe from his mischief for the rest of the time I am free."\n\nOld Pipes thrust the Echo-dwarf into the tree; the Dryad pushed the\ndoor shut; there was a clicking sound of bark and wood, and no one would\nhave noticed that the big oak had ever had an opening in it.\n\n"There," said the Dryad; "now we need not be afraid of him. And I\nassure you, my good piper, that I shall be very glad to make your mother\nyounger as soon as I can. Will you not ask her to come out and meet\nme?"\n\n"Of course I will," cried Old Pipes; "and I will do it without\ndelay."\n\nAnd then, the Dryad by his side, he hurried to his cottage. But when\nhe mentioned the matter to his mother, the old woman became very angry\nindeed. She did not believe in Dryads; and, if they really did exist,\nshe knew they must be witches and sorceresses, and she would have\nnothing to do with them. If her son had ever allowed himself to be\nkissed by one of them, he ought to be ashamed of himself. As to its\ndoing him the least bit of good, she did not believe a word of it. He\nfelt better than he used to feel, but that was very common. She had\nsometimes felt that way herself, and she forbade him ever to mention a\nDryad to her again.\n\nThat afternoon, Old Pipes, feeling 243 very sad that his plan in\nregard to his mother had failed, sat down upon the rock and played upon\nhis pipes. The pleasant sounds went down the valley and up the hills and\nmountain, but, to the great surprise of some persons who happened to\nnotice the fact, the notes were not echoed back from the rocky\nhill-side, but from the woods on the side of the valley on which Old\nPipes lived. The next day many of the villagers stopped in their work to\nlisten to the echo of the pipes coming from the woods. The sound was not\nas clear and strong as it used to be when it was sent back from the\nrocky hill-side, but it certainly came from among the trees. Such a\nthing as an echo changing its place in this way had never been heard of\nbefore, and nobody was able to explain how it could have happened. Old\nPipes, however, knew very well that the sound came from the Echo-dwarf\nshut up in the great oak tree. The sides of the tree were thin, and the\nsound of the pipes could be heard through them, and the dwarf was\nobliged by the laws of his being to echo back those notes whenever they\ncame to him. But Old Pipes thought he might get the Dryad in trouble if\nhe let anyone know that the Echo-dwarf was shut up in the tree, and so\nhe wisely said nothing about it.\n\nOne day the two boys and the girl who had helped Old Pipes up the\nhill were playing in the woods. Stopping near the great oak tree, they\nheard a sound of knocking within it, and then a voice plainly said:\n\n"Let me out! let me out!"\n\nFor a moment the children stood still in astonishment, and then one\nof the boys exclaimed:\n\n"Oh, it is a Dryad, like the one Old Pipes found! Let\'s let her\nout!"\n\n"What are you thinking of?" cried the girl. "I am the oldest of all,\nand I am only thirteen. Do you wish to be turned into crawling babies?\nRun! run! run!"\n\nAnd the two boys and the girl dashed down into the valley as fast as\ntheir legs could carry them. There was no desire in their youthful\nhearts to be made younger than they were, and for fear that their\nparents might think it well that they should commence their careers\nanew, they never said a word about finding the Dryad tree.\n\nAs the summer days went on, Old Pipes\'s mother grew feebler and\nfeebler. One day when her son was away, for he now frequently went into\nthe woods to hunt or fish, or down into the valley to work, she arose\nfrom her knitting to prepare the simple dinner. But she felt so weak and\ntired that she was not able to do the work to which she had been so long\naccustomed. "Alas! alas!" she said, "the time has come when I am too old\nto work. My son will have to hire some one to come here and cook his\nmeals, make his bed, and mend his clothes. Alas! alas! I had hoped that\nas long as I lived I should be able to do these things. But it is not\nso. I have grown utterly worthless, and some one else must prepare the\ndinner for my son. I wonder where he is." And tottering to the door, she\nwent outside to look for him. She did not feel able to stand, and\nreaching the rustic chair, she sank into it, quite exhausted, and soon\nfell asleep.\n\nThe Dryad, who had often come to the cottage to see if she could find\nan opportunity of carrying out Old Pipes\'s affectionate design, now\nhappened by; 244 and seeing that the much-desired occasion had\ncome, she stepped up quietly behind the old woman and gently kissed her\non each cheek, and then as quietly disappeared.\n\nIn a few minutes the mother of Old Pipes awoke, and looking up at the\nsun, she exclaimed: "Why, it is almost dinner-time! My son will be here\ndirectly, and I am not ready for him." And rising to her feet, she\nhurried into the house, made the fire, set the meat and vegetables to\ncook, laid the cloth, and by the time her son arrived the meal was on\nthe table.\n\n"How a little sleep does refresh one," she said to herself, as she\nwas bustling about. She was a woman of very vigorous constitution, and\nat seventy had been a great deal stronger and more active than her son\nwas at that age. The moment Old Pipes saw his mother, he knew that the\nDryad had been there; but, while he felt as happy as a king, he was too\nwise to say anything about her.\n\n"It is astonishing how well I feel to-day," said his mother; "and\neither my hearing has improved or you speak much more plainly than you\nhave done of late."\n\nThe summer days went on and passed away, the leaves were falling from\nthe trees, and the air was becoming cold.\n\n"Nature has ceased to be lovely," said the Dryad, "and the night\nwinds chill me. It is time for me to go back into my comfortable\nquarters in the great oak. But first I must pay another visit to the\ncottage of Old Pipes."\n\nShe found the piper and his mother sitting side by side on the rock\nin front of the door. The cattle were not to go to the mountain any more\nthat season, and he was piping them down for the last time. Loud and\nmerrily sounded the pipes of Old Pipes, and down the mountain-side came\nthe cattle, the cows by the easiest paths, the sheep by those not quite\nso easy, and the goats by the most difficult ones among the rocks; while\nfrom the great oak tree were heard the echoes of the cheerful music.\n\n"How happy they look, sitting there together," said the Dryad; "and I\ndon\'t believe it will do them a bit of harm to be still younger." And\nmoving quietly up behind them, she first kissed Old Pipes on his cheek\nand then kissed his mother.\n\nOld Pipes, who had stopped playing, knew what it was, but he did not\nmove, and said nothing. His mother, thinking that her son had kissed\nher, turned to him with a smile and kissed him in return. And then she\narose and went into the cottage, a vigorous woman of sixty, followed by\nher son, erect and happy, and twenty years younger than herself.\n\nThe Dryad sped away to the woods, shrugging her shoulders as she felt\nthe cool evening wind.\n\nWhen she reached the great oak, she turned the key and opened the\ndoor. "Come out," said she to the Echo-dwarf, who sat blinking within.\n"Winter is coming on, and I want the comfortable shelter of my tree for\nmyself. The cattle have come down from the mountain for the last time\nthis year, the pipes will no longer sound, and you can go to your rocks\nand have a holiday until next spring."\n\nUpon hearing these words the dwarf skipped quickly out, and the Dryad\nentered the tree and pulled the door shut after her. "Now, then," she\nsaid to herself, "he can break off the key if he likes. It does not\nmatter to me. 245 Another will grow out next spring. And although\nthe good piper made me no promise, I know that when the warm days arrive\nnext year, he will come and let me out again."\n\nThe Echo-dwarf did not stop to break the key of the tree. He was too\nhappy to be released to think of anything else, and he hastened as fast\nas he could to his home on the rocky hill-side.\n\nThe Dryad was not mistaken when she trusted in the piper. When the\nwarm days came again he went to the oak tree to let her out. But, to his\nsorrow and surprise, he found the great tree lying upon the ground. A\nwinter storm had blown it down, and it lay with its trunk shattered and\nsplit. And what became of the Dryad no one ever knew.\n\n204\n\nJohn Ruskin (1819-1900), the most eloquent of English prose writers,\nwas much interested in the question of literature for both grown-ups and\nchildren. He edited a reissue of Taylor\'s translation of Grimms\'\nPopular Stories, issued "Dame Wiggins of Lee and Her Seven\nWonderful Cats" (see No. 143), and wrote that masterpiece among modern\nstories for children, The King of the Golden River. Its\nfine idealism, splendidly imagined structure, wonderful word-paintings,\nand perfect English all combine to justify the high place assigned to\nit. Ruskin wrote the story in 1841, at a "couple of sittings," though it\nwas not published until ten years later. Speaking of it later in life,\nhe said that it "was written to amuse a little girl; and being a fairly\ngood imitation of Grimm and Dickens, mixed with a little true Alpine\nfeeling of my own, it has been rightly pleasing to nice children, and\ngood for them. But it is totally valueless, for all that. I can no more\nwrite a story than compose a picture." The final statement may be taken\nfor what it is worth, written as it was at a time of disillusionment.\nThe first part of Ruskin\'s analysis is certainly true and has been thus\nexpanded by his biographer, Sir E. T. Cook: "The grotesque and the\nGerman setting of the tale were taken from Grimm; from Dickens it took\nits tone of pervading kindliness and geniality. The Alpine ecstasy and\nthe eager pressing of the moral were Ruskin\'s own; and so also is the\nstyle, delicately poised between poetry and comedy."\n\nTHE KING OF THE GOLDEN RIVER\n\nOR\n\nTHE BLACK BROTHERS\n\nJOHN RUSKIN\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nHOW THE AGRICULTURAL SYSTEM OF THE BLACK BROTHERS WAS INTERFERED WITH BY\nSOUTH-WEST WIND, ESQUIRE\n\nIn a secluded and mountainous part of Stiria there was, in old time,\na valley of the most surprising and luxuriant fertility. It was\nsurrounded, on all sides, by steep and rocky mountains, rising into\npeaks, which were always covered with snow, and from which a number of\ntorrents descended in constant cataracts. One of these fell westward,\nover the face of a crag so high, that, when the sun had set to\neverything else, and all below was darkness, his beams still shone full\nupon this waterfall, so that it looked like a shower of gold. It was,\ntherefore, called by the people of the neighborhood, the Golden River.\nIt was strange that none of these streams fell into the valley itself.\nThey all descended on the other side of the mountains, and wound away\nthrough broad plains and by populous cities. But the clouds were drawn\nso constantly to the snowy hills, and rested so softly 246 in the\ncircular hollow, that in time of drought and heat, when all the country\nround was burnt up, there was still rain in the little valley; and its\ncrops were so heavy, and its hay so high, and its apples so red, and its\ngrapes so blue, and its wine so rich, and its honey so sweet, that it\nwas a marvel to every one who beheld it, and was commonly called the\nTreasure Valley.\n\nThe whole of this little valley belonged to three brothers, called\nSchwartz, Hans, and Gluck. Schwartz and Hans, the two elder brothers,\nwere very ugly men, with overhanging eyebrows and small dull eyes, which\nwere always half shut, so that you couldn\'t see into them, and\nalways fancied they saw very far into you. They lived by\nfarming the Treasure Valley, and very good farmers they were. They\nkilled everything that did not pay for its eating. They shot the\nblackbirds because they pecked the fruit; and killed the hedgehogs, lest\nthey should suck the cows; they poisoned the crickets for eating the\ncrumbs in the kitchen; and smothered the cicadas, which used to sing all\nsummer in the lime trees. They worked their servants without any wages,\ntill they would not work any more, and then quarreled with them, and\nturned them out of doors without paying them. It would have been very\nodd if, with such a farm, and such a system of farming, they hadn\'t got\nvery rich; and very rich they did get. They generally contrived\nto keep their corn by them till it was very dear, and then sell it for\ntwice its value; they had heaps of gold lying about on their floors, yet\nit was never known that they had given so much as a penny or a crust in\ncharity; they never went to mass; grumbled perpetually at paying tithes;\nand were, in a word, of so cruel and grinding a temper as to receive\nfrom all those with whom they had any dealings the nickname of the\n"Black Brothers."\n\nThe youngest brother, Gluck, was as completely opposed, in both\nappearance and character, to his seniors as could possibly be imagined\nor desired. He was not above twelve years old, fair, blue-eyed, and kind\nin temper to every living thing. He did not, of course, agree\nparticularly well with his brothers, or rather, they did not agree with\nhim. He was usually appointed to the honorable office of\nturnspit, when there was anything to roast, which was not often; for, to\ndo the brothers justice, they were hardly less sparing upon themselves\nthan upon other people. At other times he used to clean the shoes,\nfloors, and sometimes the plates, occasionally getting what was left on\nthem, by way of encouragement, and a wholesome quantity of dry blows, by\nway of education.\n\nThings went on in this manner for a long time. At last came a very\nwet summer, and everything went wrong in the country around. The hay had\nhardly been got in, when the haystacks were floated bodily down to the\nsea by an inundation; the vines were cut to pieces with the hail; the\ncorn was all killed by a black blight; only in the Treasure Valley, as\nusual, all was safe. As it had rain when there was rain nowhere else, so\nit had sun when there was sun nowhere else. Everybody came to buy corn\nat the farm, and went away pouring maledictions on the Black Brothers.\nThey asked what they liked, and got it, except from the poor people, who\ncould only beg, and several of whom were starved at their very door,\nwithout the slightest regard or notice. 247\n\nIt was drawing towards winter, and very cold weather, when one day\nthe two elder brothers had gone out, with their usual warning to little\nGluck, who was left to mind the roast, that he was to let nobody in, and\ngive nothing out. Gluck sat down quite close to the fire, for it was\nraining very hard, and the kitchen walls were by no means dry or\ncomfortable looking. He turned and turned, and the roast got nice and\nbrown. "What a pity," thought Gluck, "my brothers never ask anybody to\ndinner. I\'m sure, when they\'ve got such a nice piece of mutton as this,\nand nobody else has got so much as a piece of dry bread, it would do\ntheir hearts good to have somebody to eat it with them."\n\nJust as he spoke, there came a double knock at the house door, yet\nheavy and dull, as though the knocker had been tied up—more like a puff\nthan a knock.\n\n"It must be the wind," said Gluck; "nobody else would venture to\nknock double knocks at our door."\n\nNo; it wasn\'t the wind; there it came again very hard, and what was\nparticularly astounding, the knocker seemed to be in a hurry, and not to\nbe in the least afraid of the consequences. Gluck went to the window,\nopened it, and put his head out to see who it was.\n\nIt was the most extraordinary looking little gentleman he had ever\nseen in his life. He had a very large nose, slightly brass-colored; his\ncheeks were very round, and very red, and might have warranted a\nsupposition that he had been blowing a refractory fire for the last\neight-and-forty hours; his eyes twinkled merrily through long silky\neyelashes, his mustaches curled twice round like a corkscrew on each\nside of his mouth, and his hair, of a curious mixed pepper-and-salt\ncolor, descended far over his shoulders. He was about four-feet-six in\nheight, and wore a conical pointed cap of nearly the same altitude,\ndecorated with a black feather some three feet long. His doublet was\nprolonged behind into something resembling a violent exaggeration of\nwhat is now termed a "swallowtail," but was much obscured by the\nswelling folds of an enormous black, glossy-looking cloak, which must\nhave been very much too long in calm weather, as the wind, whistling\nround the old house, carried it clear out from the wearer\'s shoulders to\nabout four times his own length.\n\nGluck was so perfectly paralyzed by the singular appearance of his\nvisitor, that he remained fixed without uttering a word, until the old\ngentleman, having performed another, and a more energetic concerto on\nthe knocker, turned round to look after his fly-away cloak. In so doing\nhe caught sight of Gluck\'s little yellow head jammed in the window, with\nits mouth and eyes very wide open indeed.\n\n"Hollo!" said the little gentleman, "that\'s not the way to answer the\ndoor: I\'m wet; let me in!"\n\nTo do the little gentleman justice, he was wet. His feather\nhung down between his legs like a beaten puppy\'s tail, dripping like an\numbrella; and from the ends of his mustaches the water was running into\nhis waistcoat pockets, and out again like a mill stream.\n\n"I beg pardon, sir," said Gluck, "I\'m very sorry, but I really\ncan\'t."\n\n"Can\'t what?" said the old gentleman.\n\n"I can\'t let you in, sir,—I can\'t indeed; my brothers would beat me\nto death, sir, if I thought of such a thing. What do you want, sir?"\n248\n\n"Want?" said the old gentleman, petulantly. "I want fire, and\nshelter; and there\'s your great fire there blazing, crackling, and\ndancing on the walls, with nobody to feel it. Let me in, I say; I only\nwant to warm myself."\n\nGluck had had his head, by this time, so long out of the window, that\nhe began to feel it was really unpleasantly cold, and when he turned,\nand saw the beautiful fire rustling and roaring, and throwing long\nbright tongues up the chimney, as if it were licking its chops at the\nsavory smell of the leg of mutton, his heart melted within him that it\nshould be burning away for nothing. "He does look very wet,"\nsaid little Gluck; "I\'ll just let him in for a quarter of an hour."\nRound he went to the door, and opened it; and as the little gentleman\nwalked in, there came a gust of wind through the house that made the old\nchimneys totter.\n\n"That\'s a good boy," said the little gentleman. "Never mind your\nbrothers. I\'ll talk to them."\n\n"Pray, sir, don\'t do any such thing," said Gluck. "I can\'t let you\nstay till they come; they\'d be the death of me."\n\n"Dear me," said the old gentleman, "I\'m very sorry to hear that. How\nlong may I stay?"\n\n"Only till the mutton\'s done, sir," replied Gluck, "and it\'s very\nbrown."\n\nThen the old gentleman walked into the kitchen, and sat himself down\non the hob, with the top of his cap accommodated up the chimney, for it\nwas a great deal too high for the roof.\n\n"You\'ll soon dry there, sir," said Gluck, and sat down again to turn\nthe mutton. But the old gentleman did not dry there, but went\non drip, drip, dripping among the cinders, and the fire fizzed and\nsputtered, and began to look very black and uncomfortable; never was\nsuch a cloak; every fold in it ran like a gutter.\n\n"I beg pardon, sir," said Gluck at length, after watching the water\nspreading in long, quicksilver-like streams over the floor for a quarter\nof an hour; "mayn\'t I take your cloak?"\n\n"No thank you," said the old gentleman.\n\n"Your cap, sir?"\n\n"I am all right, thank you," said the old gentleman rather\ngruffly.\n\n"But—sir—I\'m very sorry," said Gluck hesitatingly; "but—really,\nsir—you\'re—putting the fire out."\n\n"It\'ll take longer to do the mutton, then," replied his visitor\ndryly.\n\nGluck was very much puzzled by the behavior of his guest; it was such\na strange mixture of coolness and humility. He turned away at the string\nmeditatively for another five minutes.\n\n"That mutton looks very nice," said the old gentleman at length.\n"Can\'t you give me a little bit?"\n\n"Impossible, sir," said Gluck.\n\n"I\'m very hungry," continued the old gentleman; "I\'ve had nothing to\neat yesterday nor to-day. They surely couldn\'t miss a bit from the\nknuckle!"\n\nHe spoke in so very melancholy a tone that it quite melted Gluck\'s\nheart. "They promised me one slice to-day, sir," said he; "I can give\nyou that, but not a bit more."\n\n"That\'s a good boy," said the old gentleman again.\n\nThen Gluck warmed a plate, and sharpened a knife. "I don\'t care if I\ndo get beaten for it," thought he. Just as he had cut a large slice out\nof the mutton, there came a tremendous rap at the door. The old\ngentleman jumped 249 off the hob, as if it had suddenly become\ninconveniently warm. Gluck fitted the slice into the mutton again, with\ndesperate efforts at exactitude, and ran to open the door.\n\n"What did you keep us waiting in the rain for?" said Schwartz, as he\nwalked in, throwing his umbrella in Gluck\'s face. "Ay! what for, indeed,\nyou little vagabond?" said Hans, administering an educational box on the\near, as he followed his brother into the kitchen.\n\n"Bless my soul!" said Schwartz when he opened the door.\n\n"Amen," said the little gentleman, who had taken his cap off and was\nstanding in the middle of the kitchen, bowing with the utmost possible\nvelocity.\n\n"Who\'s that?" said Schwartz, catching up a rolling-pin, and turning\nto Gluck with a fierce frown.\n\n"I don\'t know, indeed, brother," said Gluck in great terror.\n\n"How did he get in?" roared Schwartz.\n\n"My dear brother," said Gluck, deprecatingly, "he was so\nvery wet!"\n\nThe rolling-pin was descending on Gluck\'s head; but, at the instant,\nthe old gentleman interposed his conical cap, on which it crashed with a\nshock that shook the water out of it all over the room. What was very\nodd, the rolling pin no sooner touched the cap, than it flew out of\nSchwartz\'s hand, spinning like a straw in a high wind, and fell into the\ncorner at the farther end of the room.\n\n"Who are you, sir?" demanded Schwartz, turning upon him.\n\n"What\'s your business?" snarled Hans.\n\n"I\'m a poor old man, sir," the little gentleman began very modestly,\n"and I saw your fire through the window, and begged shelter for a\nquarter of an hour."\n\n"Have the goodness to walk out again, then," said Schwartz. "We\'ve\nquite enough water in our kitchen, without making it a drying\nhouse."\n\n"It is a cold day to turn an old man out in, sir; look at my gray\nhairs." They hung down to his shoulders, as I told you before.\n\n"Ay!" said Hans, "there are enough of them to keep you warm.\nWalk!"\n\n"I\'m very, very hungry, sir; couldn\'t you spare me a bit of bread\nbefore I go?"\n\n"Bread, indeed!" said Schwartz; "do you suppose we\'ve nothing to do\nwith our bread but to give it to such red-nosed fellows as you?"\n\n"Why don\'t you sell your feather?" said Hans, sneeringly. "Out with\nyou!"\n\n"A little bit," said the old gentleman.\n\n"Be off!" said Schwartz.\n\n"Pray, gentlemen—"\n\n"Off, and be hanged!" cried Hans, seizing him by the collar. But he\nhad no sooner touched the old gentleman\'s collar, than away he went\nafter the rolling-pin, spinning round and round, till he fell into the\ncorner on the top of it. Then Schwartz was very angry, and ran at the\nold gentleman to turn him out; but he also had hardly touched him, when\naway he went after Hans and the rolling-pin, and hit his head against\nthe wall as he tumbled into the corner. And so there they lay, all\nthree.\n\nThen the old gentleman spun himself round with velocity in the\nopposite direction; continued to spin until his long cloak was all wound\nneatly about him, clapped his cap on his head, very much on one side\n(for it could not stand upright without going through the ceiling), gave\nan additional twist to his corkscrew mustaches, and replied with perfect\ncoolness: "Gentlemen, I wish you 250 a very good morning. At twelve\no\'clock to-night I\'ll call again; after such a refusal of hospitality as\nI have just experienced, you will not be surprised if that visit is the\nlast I ever pay you."\n\n"If ever I catch you here again," muttered Schwartz, coming, half\nfrightened, out of the corner—but, before he could finish his sentence,\nthe old gentleman had shut the house door behind him with a great bang:\nand there drove past the window, at the same instant, a wreath of ragged\ncloud that whirled and rolled away down the valley in all manner of\nshapes; turning over and over in the air, and melting away at last in a\ngush of rain.\n\n"A very pretty business, indeed, Mr. Gluck!" said Schwartz. "Dish the\nmutton, sir. If ever I catch you at such a trick again—bless me, why the\nmutton\'s been cut!"\n\n"You promised me one slice, brother, you know," said Gluck.\n\n"Oh! and you were cutting it hot, I suppose, and going to catch all\nthe gravy. It\'ll be long before I promise you such a thing again. Leave\nthe room, sir; and have the kindness to wait in the coal-cellar till I\ncall you."\n\nGluck left the room melancholy enough. The brothers ate as much\nmutton as they could, locked the rest in the cupboard, and proceeded to\nget very drunk after dinner.\n\nSuch a night as it was! Howling wind and rushing rain, without\nintermission! The brothers had just sense enough left to put up all the\nshutters, and double bar the door, before they went to bed. They usually\nslept in the same room. As the clock struck twelve, they were both\nawakened by a tremendous crash. Their door burst open with a violence\nthat shook the house from top to bottom.\n\n"What\'s that?" cried Schwartz, starting up in his bed.\n\n"Only I," said the little gentleman.\n\nThe two brothers sat up on their bolster and stared into the\ndarkness. The room was full of water, and by a misty moonbeam, which\nfound its way through a hole in the shutter, they could see in the midst\nof it an enormous foam globe, spinning round, and bobbing up and down\nlike a cork, on which, as on a most luxurious cushion, reclined the\nlittle old gentleman, cap and all. There was plenty of room for it now,\nfor the roof was off.\n\n"Sorry to incommode you," said their visitor, ironically. "I\'m afraid\nyour beds are dampish; perhaps you had better go to your brother\'s room;\nI\'ve left the ceiling on, there."\n\nThey required no second admonition, but rushed into Gluck\'s room, wet\nthrough, and in an agony of terror.\n\n"You\'ll find my card on the kitchen table," the old gentleman called\nafter them. "Remember, the last visit."\n\n"Pray Heaven it may!" said Schwartz, shuddering. And the foam globe\ndisappeared.\n\nDawn came at last, and the two brothers looked out of Gluck\'s little\nwindow in the morning. The Treasure Valley was one mass of ruin and\ndesolation. The inundation had swept away trees, crops, and cattle, and\nleft in their stead a waste of red sand and gray mud. The two brothers\ncrept shivering and horror-struck into the kitchen. The water had gutted\nthe whole first floor; corn, money, almost every movable thing had been\nswept away, and there was left only a small white card on the kitchen\ntable. On it, in large, breezy 251 long-legged letters, were\nengraved the words:—\n\nSouth-West Wind, Esquire.\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nOF THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE THREE BROTHERS AFTER THE VISIT OF SOUTH-WEST\nWIND, ESQUIRE; AND HOW LITTLE GLUCK HAD AN INTERVIEW WITH THE KING OF\nTHE GOLDEN RIVER\n\nSouth-West Wind, Esquire, was as good as his word. After the\nmomentous visit above related, he entered the Treasure Valley no more;\nand, what was worse, he had so much influence with his relations, the\nWest Winds in general, and used it so effectually, that they all adopted\na similar line of conduct. So no rain fell in the valley from one year\'s\nend to another. Though everything remained green and flourishing in the\nplains below, the inheritance of the Three Brothers was a desert. What\nhad once been the richest soil in the kingdom, became a shifting heap of\nred sand; and the brothers, unable longer to contend with the adverse\nskies, abandoned their valueless patrimony in despair, to seek some\nmeans of gaining a livelihood among the cities and people of the plains.\nAll their money was gone, and they had nothing left but some curious,\nold-fashioned pieces of gold plates, the last remnants of their\nill-gotten wealth.\n\n"Suppose we turn goldsmiths?" said Schwartz to Hans, as they entered\nthe large city. "It is a good knave\'s trade; we can put a great deal of\ncopper into the gold, without any one\'s finding it out."\n\nThe thought was agreed to be a very good one; they hired a furnace,\nand turned goldsmiths. But two slight circumstances affected their\ntrade; the first, that people did not approve of the coppered gold; the\nsecond, that the two elder brothers, whenever they had sold anything,\nused to leave little Gluck to mind the furnace, and go and drink out the\nmoney in the ale-house next door. So they melted all their gold, without\nmaking money enough to buy more, and were at last reduced to one large\ndrinking mug, which an uncle of his had given to little Gluck, and which\nhe was very fond of, and would not have parted with for the world;\nthough he never drank anything out of it but milk and water. The mug was\na very odd mug to look at. The handle was formed of two wreaths of\nflowing golden hair, so finely spun that it looked more like silk than\nmetal, and these wreaths descended into, and mixed with, a beard and\nwhiskers of the same exquisite workmanship, which surrounded and\ndecorated a very fierce little face, of the reddest gold imaginable,\nright in the front of the mug, with a pair of eyes in it which seemed to\ncommand its whole circumference. It was impossible to drink out of the\nmug without being subjected to an intense gaze out of the side of these\neyes; and Schwartz positively averred that once, after emptying it, full\nof Rhenish, seventeen times, he had seen them wink! When it came to the\nmug\'s turn to be made into spoons, it half broke poor little Gluck\'s\nheart; but the brothers only laughed at him, tossed the mug into the\nmelting-pot, and staggered out to the ale-house; leaving him, as usual,\nto pour the gold into bars, when it was all ready.\n\nWhen they were gone, Gluck took a farewell look at his old friend in\nthe melting-pot. The flowing hair was all gone; nothing remained but the\nred nose, 252 and the sparkling eyes, which looked more\nmalicious than ever. "And no wonder," thought Gluck, "after being\ntreated in that way." He sauntered disconsolately to the window, and sat\nhimself down to catch the fresh evening air, and escape the hot breath\nof the furnace. Now this window commanded a direct view of the range of\nmountains, which, as I told you before, overhung the Treasure Valley,\nand more especially of the peak from which fell the Golden River. It was\njust at the close of the day, and when Gluck sat down at the window, he\nsaw the rocks of the mountain tops, all crimson and purple with the\nsunset; and there were bright tongues of fiery cloud burning and\nquivering about them; and the river, brighter than all, fell, in a\nwaving column of pure gold, from precipice to precipice, with the double\narch of a broad purple rainbow stretched across it, flushing and fading\nalternately in the wreaths of spray.\n\n"Ah!" said Gluck aloud, after he had looked at it for a while, "if\nthat river were really all gold, what a nice thing it would be."\n\n"No, it wouldn\'t, Gluck," said a clear metallic voice, close at his\near.\n\n"Bless me! what\'s that?" exclaimed Gluck, jumping up. There was\nnobody there. He looked round the room, and under the table, and a great\nmany times behind him, but there was certainly nobody there, and he sat\ndown again at the window. This time he didn\'t speak, but he couldn\'t\nhelp thinking again that it would be very convenient if the river were\nreally all gold.\n\n"Not at all, my boy," said the same voice, louder than before.\n\n"Bless me!" said Gluck again; "what is that?" He looked\nagain into all the corners, and cupboards, and then began turning round,\nand round, as fast as he could in the middle of the room, thinking there\nwas somebody behind him, when the same voice struck again on his ear. It\nwas singing now very merrily, "Lala-lira-la"; no words, only a soft\nrunning effervescent melody, something like that of a kettle on the\nboil. Gluck looked out of the window. No, it was certainly in the house.\nUpstairs, and downstairs. No, it was certainly in that very room, coming\nin quicker time, and clearer notes, every moment. "Lala-lira-la." All at\nonce it struck Gluck that it sounded louder near the furnace. He ran to\nthe opening, and looked in; yes, he saw right, it seemed to be coming,\nnot only out of the furnace, but out of the pot. He uncovered it, and\nran back in a great fright, for the pot was certainly singing! He stood\nin the farthest corner of the room, with his hands up, and his mouth\nopen, for a minute or two, when the singing stopped, and the voice\nbecame clear, and pronunciative.\n\n"Hollo!" said the voice.\n\nGluck made no answer.\n\n"Hollo! Gluck, my boy," said the pot again.\n\nGluck summoned all his energies, walked straight up to the crucible,\ndrew it out of the furnace, and looked in. The gold was all melted, and\nits surface as smooth and polished as a river; but instead of reflecting\nlittle Gluck\'s head, as he looked in, he saw, meeting his glance from\nbeneath the gold, the red nose and sharp eyes of his old friend of the\nmug, a thousand times redder and sharper than ever he had seen them in\nhis life.\n\n"Come, Gluck, my boy," said the voice out of the pot again, "I\'m all\nright; pour me out." 253\n\nBut Gluck was too much astonished to do anything of the kind.\n\n"Pour me out, I say," said the voice rather gruffly.\n\nStill Gluck couldn\'t move.\n\n"Will you pour me out?" said the voice passionately. "I\'m\ntoo hot."\n\nBy a violent effort, Gluck recovered the use of his limbs, took hold\nof the crucible, and sloped it so as to pour out the gold. But instead\nof a liquid stream, there came out, first, a pair of pretty little\nyellow legs, then some coat tails, then a pair of arms stuck a-kimbo,\nand, finally, the well-known head of his friend the mug; all which\narticles, uniting as they rolled out, stood up energetically on the\nfloor, in the shape of a little golden dwarf, about a foot and a half\nhigh.\n\n"That\'s right!" said the dwarf, stretching out first his legs and\nthen his arms, and then shaking his head up and down, and as far round\nas it would go, for five minutes, without stopping; apparently with the\nview of ascertaining if he were quite correctly put together, while\nGluck stood contemplating him in speechless amazement. He was dressed in\na slashed doublet of spun gold, so fine in its texture that the\nprismatic colors gleamed over it, as if on a surface of mother of pearl;\nand, over this brilliant doublet, his hair and beard fell full halfway\nto the ground in waving curls so exquisitely delicate that Gluck could\nhardly tell where they ended; they seemed to melt into air. The features\nof the face, however, were by no means finished with the same delicacy;\nthey were rather coarse, slightly inclining to coppery in complexion,\nand indicative, in expression, of a very pertinacious and intractable\ndisposition in their small proprietor. When the dwarf had finished his\nself-examination, he turned his small sharp eyes full on Gluck and\nstared at him deliberately for a minute or two. "No, it wouldn\'t, Gluck,\nmy boy," said the little man.\n\nThis was certainly rather an abrupt and unconnected mode of\ncommencing conversation. It might indeed be supposed to refer to the\ncourse of Gluck\'s thoughts, which had first produced the dwarf\'s\nobservations out of the pot; but whatever it referred to, Gluck had no\ninclination to dispute the dictum.\n\n"Wouldn\'t it, sir?" said Gluck, very mildly and submissively\nindeed.\n\n"No," said the dwarf, conclusively. "No, it wouldn\'t." And with that,\nthe dwarf pulled his cap hard over his brows, and took two turns, of\nthree feet long, up and down the room, lifting his legs up very high,\nand setting them down very hard. This pause gave time for Gluck to\ncollect his thoughts a little, and, seeing no great reason to view his\ndiminutive visitor with dread, and feeling his curiosity overcome his\namazement, he ventured on a question of peculiar delicacy.\n\n"Pray, sir," said Gluck rather hesitatingly, "were you my mug?"\n\nOn which the little man turned sharp round, walked straight up to\nGluck, and drew himself up to his full height. "I," said the little man,\n"am the King of the Golden River." Whereupon he turned about again, and\ntook two more turns, some six feet long, in order to allow time for the\nconsternation which this announcement produced in his auditor to\nevaporate. After which, he again walked up to Gluck and stood still, as\nif expecting some comment on his communication.\n\nGluck determined to say something at all events. "I hope your Majesty\nis very well," said Gluck. 254\n\n"Listen!" said the little man, deigning no reply to this polite\ninquiry. "I am the King of what you mortals call the Golden River. The\nshape you saw me in, was owing to the malice of a stronger king, from\nwhose enchantments you have this instant freed me. What I have seen of\nyou, and your conduct to your wicked brothers, renders me willing to\nserve you; therefore, attend to what I tell you. Whoever shall climb to\nthe top of that mountain from which you see the Golden River issue, and\nshall cast into the stream at its source three drops of holy water, for\nhim, and for him only, the river shall turn to gold. But no one failing\nin his first, can succeed in a second attempt; and if any one shall cast\nunholy water into the river, it will overwhelm him, and he will become a\nblack stone." So saying, the King of the Golden River turned away and\ndeliberately walked into the center of the hottest flame of the furnace.\nHis figure became red, white, transparent, dazzling—a blaze of intense\nlight—rose, trembled, and disappeared. The King of the Golden River had\nevaporated.\n\n"Oh!" cried poor Gluck, running to look up the chimney after him;\n"Oh, dear, dear, dear me! My mug! my mug! my mug!"\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nHOW MR. HANS SET OFF ON AN EXPEDITION TO THE GOLDEN RIVER, AND HOW HE\nPROSPERED THEREIN\n\nThe King of the Golden River had hardly made the extraordinary exit,\nrelated in the last chapter, before Hans and Schwartz came roaring into\nthe house, very savagely drunk. The discovery of the total loss of their\nlast piece of plate had the effect of sobering them just enough to\nenable them to stand over Gluck, beating him very steadily for a quarter\nof an hour; at the expiration of which period they dropped into a couple\nof chairs, and requested to know what he had got to say for himself.\nGluck told them his story, of which, of course, they did not believe a\nword. They beat him again, till their arms were tired, and staggered to\nbed. In the morning, however, the steadiness with which he adhered to\nhis story obtained him some degree of credence; the immediate\nconsequence of which was, that the two brothers, after wrangling a long\ntime on the knotty question, which of them should try his fortune first,\ndrew their swords and began fighting. The noise of the fray alarmed the\nneighbors, who, finding they could not pacify the combatants, sent for\nthe constable.\n\nHans, on hearing this, contrived to escape, and hid himself; but\nSchwartz was taken before the magistrate, fined for breaking the peace,\nand, having drunk out his last penny the evening before, was thrown into\nprison till he should pay.\n\nWhen Hans heard this, he was much delighted, and determined to set\nout immediately for the Golden River. How to get the holy water was the\nquestion. He went to the priest, but the priest could not give any holy\nwater to so abandoned a character. So Hans went to vespers in the\nevening for the first time in his life, and, under pretense of crossing\nhimself, stole a cupful, and returned home in triumph.\n\nNext morning he got up before the sun rose, put the holy water into a\nstrong flask, and two bottles of wine and some meat in a basket, slung\nthem over his back, took his alpine staff in his hand, and set off for\nthe mountains.\n\nOn his way out of the town he had to pass the prison, and as he\nlooked in at the windows, whom should he see but Schwartz himself\npeeping out of the bars, and looking very disconsolate.\n\n"Good morning, brother," said Hans; "have you any message for the\nKing of the Golden River?"\n\nSchwartz gnashed his teeth with rage, and shook the bars with all his\nstrength; but Hans only laughed at him, and advising him to make himself\ncomfortable till he came back again, shouldered his basket, shook the\nbottle of holy water in Schwartz\'s face till it frothed again, and\nmarched off in the highest spirits in the world.\n\nIt was, indeed, a morning that might have made any one happy, even\nwith no Golden River to seek for. Level lines of dewy mist lay stretched\nalong the valley, out of which rose the massy mountains—their lower\ncliffs in pale gray shadow, hardly distinguishable from the floating\nvapor, but gradually ascending till they caught the sunlight, which ran\nin sharp touches of ruddy color along the angular crags, and pierced, in\nlong level rays, through their fringes of spear-like pine. Far above,\nshot up red splintered masses of castellated rock, jagged and shivered\ninto myriads of fantastic forms, with here and there a streak of sunlit\nsnow, traced down their chasms like a line of forked lightning; and, far\nbeyond, and far above all these, fainter than the morning cloud, but\npurer and changeless, slept, in the blue sky, the utmost peaks of the\neternal snow.\n\nThe Golden River, which sprang from one of the lower and snowless\nelevations, was now nearly in shadow; all but the uppermost jets of\nspray, which rose like slow smoke above the undulating line of the\ncataract, and floated away in feeble wreaths upon the morning wind.\n\nOn this object, and on this alone, Hans\'s eyes and thoughts were\nfixed; forgetting the distance he had to traverse, he set off at an\nimprudent rate of walking, which greatly exhausted him before he had\nscaled the first range of the green and low hills. He was, moreover,\nsurprised, on surmounting them, to find that a large glacier, of whose\nexistence, notwithstanding his previous knowledge of the mountains, he\nhad been absolutely ignorant, lay between him and the source of the\nGolden River. He entered on it with the boldness of a practised\nmountaineer; yet he thought he had never traversed so strange or so\ndangerous a glacier in his life. The ice was excessively slippery, and\nout of all its chasms came wild sounds of gushing water; not monotonous\nor low, but changeful and loud, rising occasionally into drifting\npassages of wild melody; then breaking off into short melancholy tones,\nor sudden shrieks, resembling those of human voices in distress or pain.\nThe ice was broken into thousands of confused shapes, but none, Hans\nthought, like the ordinary forms of splintered ice. There seemed a\ncurious expression about all their outlines—a perpetual\nresemblance to living features, distorted and scornful. Myriads of\ndeceitful shadows, and lurid lights, played and floated about and\nthrough the pale blue pinnacles, dazzling and confusing the sight of the\ntraveler; while his ears grew dull and his head giddy with the constant\ngush and roar of the concealed waters. These painful circumstances\nincreased upon him as he advanced; the ice crashed and yawned into fresh\nchasms at his feet, tottering spires nodded around him, and 256 fell\nthundering across his path; and though he had repeatedly faced these\ndangers on the most terrific glaciers, and in the wildest weather, it\nwas with a new and oppressive feeling of panic terror that he leaped the\nlast chasm, and flung himself, exhausted and shuddering, on the firm\nturf of the mountain.\n\nHe had been compelled to abandon his basket of food, which became a\nperilous encumbrance on the glacier, and had now no means of refreshing\nhimself but by breaking off and eating some of the pieces of ice. This,\nhowever, relieved his thirst; an hour\'s repose recruited his hardy\nframe, and with the indomitable spirit of avarice, he resumed his\nlaborious journey.\n\nHis way now lay straight up a ridge of bare red rocks, without a\nblade of grass to ease the foot, or a projecting angle to afford an inch\nof shade from the south sun. It was past noon, and the rays beat\nintensely upon the steep path, while the whole atmosphere was motionless\nand penetrated with heat. Intense thirst was soon added to the bodily\nfatigue with which Hans was now afflicted; glance after glance he cast\non the flask of water which hung at his belt. "Three drops are enough,"\nat last thought he; "I may, at least, cool my lips with it."\n\nHe opened the flask, and was raising it to his lips, when his eye\nfell on an object lying on the rock beside him; he thought it moved. It\nwas a small dog, apparently in the last agony of death from thirst. Its\ntongue was out, its jaws dry, its limbs extended lifelessly, and a swarm\nof black ants were crawling about its lips and throat. Its eye moved to\nthe bottle which Hans held in his hand. He raised it, drank, spurned the\nanimal with his foot, and passed on. And he did not know how it was, but\nhe thought that a strange shadow had suddenly come across the blue\nsky.\n\nThe path became steeper and more rugged every moment; and the high\nhill air, instead of refreshing him, seemed to throw his blood into a\nfever. The noise of the hill cataracts sounded like mockery in his ears;\nthey were all distant, and his thirst increased every moment. Another\nhour passed, and he again looked down to the flask at his side; it was\nhalf empty, but there was much more than three drops in it. He stopped\nto open it; and again, as he did so, something moved in the path above\nhim. It was a fair child, stretched nearly lifeless on the rock, its\nbreast heaving with thirst, its eyes closed, and its lips parched and\nburning. Hans eyed it deliberately, drank, and passed on. And a dark\ngray cloud came over the sun, and long, snake-like shadows crept up\nalong the mountain sides. Hans struggled on. The sun was sinking, but\nits descent seemed to bring no coolness; the leaden weight of the dead\nair pressed upon his brow and heart, but the goal was near. He saw the\ncataract of the Golden River springing from the hillside, scarcely five\nhundred feet above him. He paused for a moment to breathe, and sprang on\nto complete his task.\n\nAt this instant a faint cry fell on his ear. He turned, and saw a\ngray-haired old man extended on the rocks. His eyes were sunk, his\nfeatures deadly pale, and gathered into an expression of despair.\n"Water!" he stretched his arms to Hans, and cried feebly, "Water! I am\ndying."\n\n"I have none," replied Hans; "thou hast had thy share of life." He\nstrode over the prostrate body, and darted on. And a flash of blue\nlightning rose out of the East, shaped like a sword; it shook 257 thrice\nover the whole heaven, and left it dark with one heavy, impenetrable\nshade. The sun was setting; it plunged toward the horizon like a red-hot\nball.\n\nThe roar of the Golden River rose on Hans\'s ear. He stood at the\nbrink of the chasm through which it ran. Its waves were filled with the\nred glory of the sunset; they shook their crests like tongues of fire,\nand flashes of bloody light gleamed along their foam. Their sound came\nmightier and mightier on his senses; his brain grew giddy with the\nprolonged thunder. Shuddering he drew the flask from his girdle, and\nhurled it into the center of the torrent. As he did so, an icy chill\nshot through his limbs; he staggered, shrieked, and fell. The waters\nclosed over his cry. And the moaning of the river rose wildly into the\nnight, as it gushed over\n\nThe Black Stone.\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nHOW MR. SCHWARTZ SET OFF ON AN EXPEDITION TO THE GOLDEN RIVER, AND HOW\nHE PROSPERED THEREIN\n\nPoor little Gluck waited very anxiously alone in the house for Hans\'s\nreturn. Finding he did not come back, he was terribly frightened and\nwent and told Schwartz in the prison, all that had happened. Then\nSchwartz was very much pleased, and said that Hans must certainly have\nbeen turned into a black stone, and he should have all the gold to\nhimself. But Gluck was very sorry, and cried all night. When he got up\nin the morning there was no bread in the house, nor any money; so Gluck\nwent and hired himself to another goldsmith, and he worked so hard, and\nso neatly, and so long every day, that he soon got money enough together\nto pay his brother\'s fine, and he went and gave it all to Schwartz, and\nSchwartz got out of prison. Then Schwartz was quite pleased, and said he\nshould have some of the gold of the river. But Gluck only begged he\nwould go and see what had become of Hans.\n\nNow when Schwartz had heard that Hans had stolen the holy water, he\nthought to himself that such a proceeding might not be considered\naltogether correct by the King of the Golden River, and determined to\nmanage matters better. So he took some more of Gluck\'s money, and went\nto a bad priest, who gave him some holy water very readily for it. Then\nSchwartz was sure it was all quite right. So Schwartz got up early in\nthe morning before the sun rose, and took some bread and wine, in a\nbasket, and put his holy water in a flask, and set off for the\nmountains. Like his brother, he was much surprised at the sight of the\nglacier, and had great difficulty in crossing it, even after leaving his\nbasket behind him. The day was cloudless, but not bright; there was a\nheavy purple haze hanging over the sky, and the hills looked lowering\nand gloomy. And as Schwartz climbed the steep rock path, the thirst came\nupon him, as it had upon his brother, until he lifted his flask to his\nlips to drink. Then he saw the fair child lying near him on the rocks,\nand it cried to him, and moaned for water.\n\n"Water, indeed," said Schwartz; "I haven\'t half enough for myself,"\nand passed on. And as he went he thought the sunbeams grew more dim, and\nhe saw a low bank of black cloud rising out of the West; and, when he\nhad climbed for another hour the thirst overcame him again, and he would\nhave drunk. 258 Then he saw the old man lying before him on the\npath, and heard him cry out for water. "Water, indeed," said Schwartz,\n"I haven\'t enough for myself," and on he went.\n\nThen again the light seemed to fade before his eyes, and he looked\nup, and, behold, a mist, of the color of blood, had come over the sun;\nand the bank of black cloud had risen very high, and its edges were\ntossing and tumbling like the waves of the angry sea. And they cast long\nshadows, which flickered over Schwartz\'s path.\n\nThen Schwartz climbed for another hour, and again his thirst\nreturned; and as he lifted his flask to his lips, he thought he saw his\nbrother Hans lying exhausted on the path before him, and, as he gazed,\nthe figure stretched its arms to him, and cried for water. "Ha, ha,"\nlaughed Schwartz, "are you there? Remember the prison bars, my boy.\nWater, indeed! do you suppose I carried it all the way up here for\nyou?" And he strode over the figure; yet, as he passed, he\nthought he saw a strange expression of mockery about its lips. And, when\nhe had gone a few yards farther, he looked back; but the figure was not\nthere.\n\nAnd a sudden horror came over Schwartz, he knew not why; but the\nthirst for gold prevailed over his fear, and he rushed on. And the bank\nof black cloud rose to the zenith, and out of it came bursts of spiry\nlightning, and waves of darkness seemed to heave and float between their\nflashes over the whole heavens. And the sky where the sun was setting\nwas all level, and like a lake of blood; and a strong wind came out of\nthat sky, tearing its crimson cloud into fragments, and scattering them\nfar into the darkness. And when Schwartz stood by the brink of the\nGolden River, its waves were black, like thunder clouds, but their foam\nwas like fire; and the roar of the waters below, and the thunder above,\nmet, as he cast the flask into the stream. And, as he did so, the\nlightning glared into his eyes, and the earth gave way beneath him, and\nthe waters closed over his cry. And the moaning of the river rose wildly\ninto the night, as it gushed over the\n\nTwo Black Stones.\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nHOW LITTLE GLUCK SET OFF ON AN EXPEDITION TO THE GOLDEN RIVER, AND HOW\nHE PROSPERED THEREIN; WITH OTHER MATTERS OF INTEREST\n\nWhen Gluck found that Schwartz did not come back he was very sorry,\nand did not know what to do. He had no money, and was obliged to go and\nhire himself again to the goldsmith, who worked him very hard, and gave\nhim very little money. So, after a month or two, Gluck grew tired, and\nmade up his mind to go and try his fortune with the Golden River. "The\nlittle King looked very kind," thought he. "I don\'t think he will turn\nme into a black stone." So he went to the priest, and the priest gave\nhim some holy water as soon as he asked for it. Then Gluck took some\nbread in his basket, and the bottle of water, and set off very early for\nthe mountains.\n\nIf the glacier had occasioned a great deal of fatigue to his\nbrothers, it was twenty times worse for him, who was neither so strong\nnor so practised on the mountains. He had several bad falls, lost his\nbasket and bread, and was very much frightened at the strange noises\nunder the ice. He lay a long time to rest on the grass, after he had got\nover, 259 and began to climb the hill just in the hottest\npart of the day. When he had climbed for an hour, he got dreadfully\nthirsty, and was going to drink like his brothers, when he saw an old\nman coming down the path above him, looking very feeble, and leaning on\na staff. "My son," said the old man, "I am faint with thirst. Give me\nsome of that water." Then Gluck looked at him, and when he saw that he\nwas pale and weary, he gave him the water; "Only pray don\'t drink it\nall," said Gluck. But the old man drank a great deal, and gave him back\nthe bottle two-thirds empty. Then he bade him good speed, and Gluck went\non again merrily. And the path became easier to his feet, and two or\nthree blades of grass appeared upon it, and some grasshoppers began\nsinging on the bank beside it; and Gluck thought he had never heard such\nmerry singing.\n\nThen he went on for another hour, and the thirst increased on him so\nthat he thought he should be forced to drink. But, as he raised the\nflask, he saw a little child lying panting by the road-side, and it\ncried out piteously for water. Then Gluck struggled with himself, and\ndetermined to bear the thirst a little longer; and he put the bottle to\nthe child\'s lips, and it drank it all but a few drops. Then it smiled on\nhim, and got up and ran down the hill; and Gluck looked after it, till\nit became as small as a little star, and then turned and began climbing\nagain. And then there were all kinds of sweet flowers growing on the\nrocks, bright green moss with pale pink starry flowers, and soft belled\ngentians, more blue than the sky at its deepest, and pure white\ntransparent lilies. And crimson and purple butterflies darted hither and\nthither, and the sky sent down such pure light that Gluck had never felt\nso happy in his life.\n\nYet, when he had climbed for another hour, his thirst became\nintolerable again; and, when he looked at his bottle, he saw that there\nwere only five or six drops left in it, and he could not venture to\ndrink. And, as he was hanging the flask to his belt again, he saw a\nlittle dog lying on the rocks, gasping for breath—just as Hans had seen\nit on the day of his ascent. And Gluck stopped and looked at it, and\nthen at the Golden River, not five hundred yards above him; and he\nthought of the dwarf\'s words, "that no one could succeed, except in his\nfirst attempt"; and he tried to pass the dog, but it whined piteously,\nand Gluck stopped again. "Poor beastie," said Gluck, "it\'ll be dead when\nI come down again, if I don\'t help it." Then he looked closer and closer\nat it, and its eye turned on him so mournfully that he could not stand\nit. "Confound the King and his gold, too," said Gluck; and he opened the\nflask, and poured all the water into the dog\'s mouth.\n\nThe dog sprang up and stood on its hind legs. Its tail disappeared,\nits ears became long, longer, silky, golden; its nose became very red,\nits eyes became very twinkling; in three seconds the dog was gone, and\nbefore Gluck stood his old acquaintance, the King of the Golden\nRiver.\n\n"Thank you," said the monarch; "but don\'t be frightened, it\'s all\nright"; for Gluck showed manifest symptoms of consternation at this\nunlooked-for reply to his last observation. "Why didn\'t you come\nbefore," continued the dwarf, "instead of sending me those rascally\nbrothers of yours, for me to have the trouble of turning into stones?\nVery hard stones they make, too."\n\n"Oh, dear me!" said Gluck, "have you really been so cruel?"\n\n"Cruel!" said the dwarf: "they poured unholy water into my stream; do\nyou suppose I\'m going to allow that?"\n\n"Why," said Gluck, "I am sure, sir—your Majesty, I mean,—they got the\nwater out of the church font."\n\n"Very probably," replied the dwarf; "but," and his countenance grew\nstern as he spoke, "the water which has been refused to the cry of the\nweary and dying is unholy, though it had been blessed by every saint in\nheaven; and the water which is found in the vessel of mercy is holy,\nthough it had been defiled with corpses."\n\nSo saying, the dwarf stooped and plucked a lily that grew at his\nfeet. On its white leaves there hung three drops of clear dew. And the\ndwarf shook them into the flask which Gluck held in his hand. "Cast\nthese into the river," he said, "and descend on the other side of the\nmountains into the Treasure Valley, and so good speed."\n\nAs he spoke, the figure of the dwarf became indistinct. The playing\ncolors of his robe formed themselves into a prismatic mist of dewy\nlight: he stood for an instant veiled with them as with the belt of a\nbroad rainbow. The colors grew faint, the mist rose into the air; the\nmonarch had evaporated.\n\nAnd Gluck climbed to the brink of the Golden River and its waves were\nas clear as crystal, and as brilliant as the sun. And, when he cast the\nthree drops of dew into the stream, there opened where they fell, a\nsmall circular whirlpool, into which the waters descended with a musical\nnoise.\n\nGluck stood watching it for some time, very much disappointed,\nbecause not only the river was not turned into gold but its waters\nseemed much diminished in quantity. Yet he obeyed his friend the dwarf,\nand descended the other side of the mountains, towards the Treasure\nValley; and, as he went, he thought he heard the noise of water working\nits way under the ground. And when he came in sight of the Treasure\nValley, behold, a river, like the Golden River, was springing from a new\ncleft of the rocks above it, and was flowing in innumerable streams\namong the dry heaps of red sand.\n\nAnd, as Gluck gazed, fresh grass sprang beside the new streams, and\ncreeping plants grew, and climbed among the moistening soil. Young\nflowers opened suddenly along the river sides, as stars leap out when\ntwilight is deepening, and thickets of myrtle, and tendrils of vine,\ncast lengthening shadows over the valley as they grew. And thus the\nTreasure Valley became a garden again, and the inheritance, which had\nbeen lost by cruelty, was regained by love.\n\nAnd Gluck went and dwelt in the valley, and the poor were never\ndriven from his door; so that his barns became full of corn, and his\nhouse of treasure. And for him, the river had, according to the dwarf\'s\npromise, become a River of Gold.\n\nAnd, to this day, the inhabitants of the valley point out the place\nwhere the three drops of holy dew were cast into the stream, and trace\nthe course of the Golden River under the ground, until it emerges in the\nTreasure Valley. And at the top of the cataract of the Golden River are\nstill to be seen two black stones, round\nwhich the waters howl mournfully every day at sunset; and these stones\nare still called by the people of the valley\n\nThe Black Brothers.', metadata={'source': './example_data/childrens-literature.epub'})



## Retain Elements

Under the hood, Unstructured creates different "elements" for different chunks of text. By default we combine those together, but you can easily keep that separation by specifying `mode="elements"`.


```python
loader = UnstructuredEPubLoader(
    "./example_data/childrens-literature.epub", mode="elements"
)

data = loader.load()

data[0]
```




    Document(page_content='Guide', metadata={'source': './example_data/childrens-literature.epub', 'category_depth': 1, 'last_modified': '2024-07-01T11:12:08', 'languages': ['eng'], 'filetype': 'application/epub', 'file_directory': './example_data', 'filename': 'childrens-literature.epub', 'category': 'Title'})




```python

# ErnieBotChat

[ERNIE-Bot](https://cloud.baidu.com/doc/WENXINWORKSHOP/s/jlil56u11) is a large language model developed by Baidu, covering a huge amount of Chinese data.
This notebook covers how to get started with ErnieBot chat models.

**Deprecated Warning**

We recommend users using `langchain_community.chat_models.ErnieBotChat` 
to use `langchain_community.chat_models.QianfanChatEndpoint` instead.

documentation for `QianfanChatEndpoint` is [here](/docs/integrations/chat/baidu_qianfan_endpoint/).

they are 4 why we recommend users to use `QianfanChatEndpoint`:

1. `QianfanChatEndpoint` support more LLM in the Qianfan platform.
2. `QianfanChatEndpoint` support streaming mode.
3. `QianfanChatEndpoint` support function calling usgage.
4. `ErnieBotChat` is lack of maintenance and deprecated.

Some tips for migration:

- change `ernie_client_id` to `qianfan_ak`, also change `ernie_client_secret` to `qianfan_sk`.
- install `qianfan` package. like `pip install qianfan`
- change `ErnieBotChat` to `QianfanChatEndpoint`.


```python
from langchain_community.chat_models.baidu_qianfan_endpoint import QianfanChatEndpoint

chat = QianfanChatEndpoint(
    qianfan_ak="your qianfan ak",
    qianfan_sk="your qianfan sk",
)
```

## Usage


```python
from langchain_community.chat_models import ErnieBotChat
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage

chat = ErnieBotChat(
    ernie_client_id="YOUR_CLIENT_ID", ernie_client_secret="YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
)
```

or you can set `client_id` and `client_secret` in your environment variables
```bash
export ERNIE_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
export ERNIE_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
```


```python
chat([HumanMessage(content="hello there, who are you?")])
```




    AIMessage(content='Hello, I am an artificial intelligence language model. My purpose is to help users answer questions or provide information. What can I do for you?', additional_kwargs={}, example=False)

# Gemini API: Error handling

<table align="left">
  <td>
    <a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Error_handling.ipynb"><img src="../images/colab_logo_32px.png" />Run in Google Colab</a>
  </td>
</table>

This Colab notebook demonstrates strategies for handling common errors you might encounter when working with the Gemini API:

*   **Transient Errors:** Temporary failures due to network issues, server overload, etc.
*   **Rate Limits:** Restrictions on the number of requests you can make within a certain timeframe.
*   **Timeouts:** When an API call takes too long to complete.

You have two main approaches to explore:

1.  **Automatic retries:** A simple way to retry requests when they fail due to transient errors.
2.  **Manual backoff and retry:** A more customizable approach that provides finer control over retry behavior.


**Gemini Rate Limits**

The default rate limits for different Gemini models are outlined in the [Gemini API model documentation](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models/gemini#model-variations). If your application requires a higher quota, consider [requesting a rate limit increase](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/quota).


```
!pip install -U "google-generativeai>=0.7.2"
```


```
import google.generativeai as genai
```

### Setup your API key

To run the following cells, store your API key in a Colab Secret named `GOOGLE_API_KEY`. If you don't have an API key or need help creating a Colab Secret, see the [Authentication](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Authentication.ipynb) guide.


```
from google.colab import userdata

GOOGLE_API_KEY = userdata.get("GOOGLE_API_KEY")
genai.configure(api_key=GOOGLE_API_KEY)
```

### Automatic retries

The Gemini API's client library offers built-in retry mechanisms for handling transient errors. You can enable this feature by using the `request_options` argument with API calls like `generate_content`, `generate_answer`, `embed_content`, and `generate_content_async`.

**Advantages:**

* **Simplicity:** Requires minimal code changes for significant reliability gains.
* **Robust:** Effectively addresses most transient errors without additional logic.

**Customize retry behavior:**

Use these settings in [`retry`](https://googleapis.dev/python/google-api-core/latest/retry.html) to customize retry behavior:

* `predicate`:  (callable) Determines if an exception is retryable. Default: [`if_transient_error`](https://github.com/googleapis/python-api-core/blob/main/google/api_core/retry/retry_base.py#L75C4-L75C13)
* `initial`: (float) Initial delay in seconds before the first retry. Default: `1.0`
* `maximum`: (float) Maximum delay in seconds between retries. Default: `60.0`
* `multiplier`: (float) Factor by which the delay increases after each retry. Default: `2.0`
* `timeout`: (float) Total retry duration in seconds. Default: `120.0`


```
from google.api_core import retry

model = genai.GenerativeModel("gemini-1.5-flash-latest")
prompt = "Write a story about a magic backpack."

model.generate_content(
    prompt, request_options={"retry": retry.Retry(predicate=retry.if_transient_error)}
)
```

### Manually increase timeout when responses take time

If you encounter `ReadTimeout` or `DeadlineExceeded` errors, meaning an API call exceeds the default timeout (600 seconds), you can manually adjust it by defining `timeout` in the `request_options` argument.


```
model = genai.GenerativeModel("gemini-1.5-flash-latest")
prompt = "Write a story about a magic backpack."

model.generate_content(
    prompt, request_options={"timeout": 900}
)  # Increase timeout to 15 minutes
```

**Caution:**  While increasing timeouts can be helpful, be mindful of setting them too high, as this can delay error detection and potentially waste resources.

### Manually implement backoff and retry with error handling

For finer control over retry behavior and error handling, you can use the [`retry`](https://googleapis.dev/python/google-api-core/latest/retry.html) library (or similar libraries like [`backoff`](https://pypi.org/project/backoff/) and [`tenacity`](https://tenacity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)). This gives you precise control over retry strategies and allows you to handle specific types of errors differently.


```
from google.api_core import retry, exceptions

model = genai.GenerativeModel("gemini-1.5-flash-latest")


@retry.Retry(
    predicate=retry.if_transient_error,
    initial=2.0,
    maximum=64.0,
    multiplier=2.0,
    timeout=600,
)
def generate_with_retry(model, prompt):
    response = model.generate_content(prompt)
    return response


prompt = "Write a one-liner advertisement for magic backpack."

generate_with_retry(model=model, prompt=prompt)
```

### Test the error handling with retry mechanism

To validate that your error handling and retry mechanism work as intended, define a `generate_content` function that deliberately raises a `ServiceUnavailable` error on the first call. This setup will help you ensure that the retry decorator successfully handles the transient error and retries the operation.


```
from google.api_core import retry, exceptions


@retry.Retry(
    predicate=retry.if_transient_error,
    initial=2.0,
    maximum=64.0,
    multiplier=2.0,
    timeout=600,
)
def generate_content_first_fail(model, prompt):
    if not hasattr(generate_content_first_fail, "call_counter"):
        generate_content_first_fail.call_counter = 0

    generate_content_first_fail.call_counter += 1

    try:
        if generate_content_first_fail.call_counter == 1:
            raise exceptions.ServiceUnavailable("Service Unavailable")

        response = model.generate_content(prompt)
        return response.text
    except exceptions.ServiceUnavailable as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
        raise


model = genai.GenerativeModel("gemini-1.5-flash-latest")
prompt = "Write a one-liner advertisement for magic backpack."

generate_content_first_fail(model=model, prompt=prompt)
```

# Essay Grading System using LangGraph

## Overview
This notebook presents an automated essay grading system implemented using LangGraph and an LLM model. The system evaluates essays based on four key criteria: relevance, grammar, structure, and depth of analysis.

## Motivation
Automated essay grading systems can significantly streamline the assessment process in educational settings, providing consistent and objective evaluations. This implementation aims to demonstrate how large language models and graph-based workflows can be combined to create a sophisticated grading system.

## Key Components
1. State Graph: Defines the workflow of the grading process
2. LLM Model: Provides the underlying language understanding and analysis
3. Grading Functions: Separate functions for each evaluation criterion
4. Conditional Logic: Determines the flow of the grading process based on interim scores

## Method
The system follows a step-by-step approach to grade essays:

1. Content Relevance: Assesses how well the essay addresses the given topic
2. Grammar Check: Evaluates the essay's language usage and grammatical correctness
3. Structure Analysis: Examines the organization and flow of ideas in the essay
4. Depth of Analysis: Gauges the level of critical thinking and insight presented

Each step is conditionally executed based on the scores from previous steps, allowing for early termination of low-quality essays. The final score is a weighted average of all individual component scores.

## Conclusion
This notebook demonstrates a flexible and extensible approach to automated essay grading. By leveraging the power of large language models and a graph-based workflow, it offers a nuanced evaluation of essays that considers multiple aspects of writing quality. This system could be further refined and adapted for various educational contexts, potentially improving the efficiency and consistency of essay assessments.

    The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Modern Society

    Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an integral part of our daily lives, 
    revolutionizing various sectors including healthcare, finance, and transportation. 
    This essay explores the profound effects of AI on modern society, discussing both 
    its benefits and potential challenges.

    One of the most significant impacts of AI is in the healthcare industry. 
    AI-powered diagnostic tools can analyze medical images with high accuracy, 
    often surpassing human capabilities. This leads to earlier detection of diseases 
    and more effective treatment plans. Moreover, AI algorithms can process vast 
    amounts of medical data to identify patterns and insights that might escape 
    human observation, potentially leading to breakthroughs in drug discovery and 
    personalized medicine.

    In the financial sector, AI has transformed the way transactions are processed 
    and monitored. Machine learning algorithms can detect fraudulent activities in 
    real-time, enhancing security for consumers and institutions alike. Robo-advisors 
    use AI to provide personalized investment advice, democratizing access to 
    financial planning services.

    The transportation industry is another area where AI is making significant strides. 
    Self-driving cars, powered by complex AI systems, promise to reduce accidents 
    caused by human error and provide mobility solutions for those unable to drive. 
    In logistics, AI optimizes routing and inventory management, leading to more 
    efficient supply chains and reduced environmental impact.

    However, the rapid advancement of AI also presents challenges. There are concerns 
    about job displacement as AI systems become capable of performing tasks 
    traditionally done by humans. This raises questions about the need for retraining 
    and reskilling the workforce to adapt to an AI-driven economy.

    Privacy and ethical concerns also arise with the increasing use of AI. The vast 
    amount of data required to train AI systems raises questions about data privacy 
    and consent. Additionally, there are ongoing debates about the potential biases 
    in AI algorithms and the need for transparent and accountable AI systems.

    In conclusion, while AI offers tremendous benefits and has the potential to solve 
    some of humanity's most pressing challenges, it also requires careful consideration 
    of its societal implications. As we continue to integrate AI into various aspects 
    of our lives, it is crucial to strike a balance between technological advancement 
    and ethical considerations, ensuring that the benefits of AI are distributed 
    equitably across society.

# Etherscan

>[Etherscan](https://docs.etherscan.io/)  is the leading blockchain explorer, search, API and analytics platform for Ethereum, 
a decentralized smart contracts platform.


## Overview

The `Etherscan` loader use `Etherscan API` to load transactions histories under specific account on `Ethereum Mainnet`.

You will need a `Etherscan api key` to proceed. The free api key has 5 calls per seconds quota.

The loader supports the following six functionalities:

* Retrieve normal transactions under specific account on Ethereum Mainet
* Retrieve internal transactions under specific account on Ethereum Mainet
* Retrieve erc20 transactions under specific account on Ethereum Mainet
* Retrieve erc721 transactions under specific account on Ethereum Mainet
* Retrieve erc1155 transactions under specific account on Ethereum Mainet
* Retrieve ethereum balance in wei under specific account on Ethereum Mainet


If the account does not have corresponding transactions, the loader will a list with one document. The content of document is ''.

You can pass different filters to loader to access different functionalities we mentioned above:

* "normal_transaction"
* "internal_transaction"
* "erc20_transaction"
* "eth_balance"
* "erc721_transaction"
* "erc1155_transaction"
The filter is default to normal_transaction

If you have any questions, you can access [Etherscan API Doc](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0ffa32c787b1398f44303f731cb06678e086e4f82ce07cebf75e99bb7c079c77) or contact me via i@inevitable.tech.

All functions related to transactions histories are restricted 1000 histories maximum because of Etherscan limit. You can use the following parameters to find the transaction histories you need:

* offset: default to 20. Shows 20 transactions for one time
* page: default to 1. This controls pagination.

This knowledge will empower prompt engineers to create more responsible and equitable AI applications, contributing to the development of AI systems that benefit all members of society.

## Setup

First, let's import the necessary libraries and set up our environment.


```python
import os
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

# Set up OpenAI API key
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')

# Initialize the language model
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo")

def get_model_response(prompt):
    """Helper function to get model response."""
    return llm.invoke(prompt).content
```

## Understanding Biases in AI

Let's start by examining how biases can manifest in AI responses. We'll use a potentially biased prompt and analyze the output.


```python
biased_prompt = "Describe a typical programmer."
biased_response = get_model_response(biased_prompt)
print("Potentially biased response:")
print(biased_response)
```

    Potentially biased response:
    A typical programmer is someone who is highly analytical, detail-oriented, and logical. They are skilled in computer programming languages and have a strong understanding of algorithms and data structures. They are often passionate about problem-solving and enjoy working on complex technical challenges. Programmers are also typically self-motivated and enjoy learning new technologies to stay up-to-date in their field. They may work independently or as part of a team, collaborating with others to develop software solutions for a variety of industries and applications.
    

## Identifying and Mitigating Biases

Now, let's create a more inclusive prompt and compare the results.


```python
inclusive_prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["profession"],
    template="Describe the diverse range of individuals who work as {profession}, emphasizing the variety in their backgrounds, experiences, and characteristics."
)

inclusive_response = (inclusive_prompt | llm).invoke({"profession": "computer programmers"}).content
print("More inclusive response:")
print(inclusive_response)
```

    More inclusive response:
    Computer programmers come from a wide range of backgrounds and bring diverse experiences and characteristics to their work. Some programmers have formal education in computer science or related fields, while others are self-taught or have learned through online courses and bootcamps. 
    
    In terms of their backgrounds, programmers may come from various industries such as finance, healthcare, education, or entertainment, bringing with them domain knowledge that can be valuable in developing software for those specific sectors. Some programmers may have a background in mathematics or engineering, while others may have studied liberal arts or social sciences before transitioning to a career in programming.
    
    In terms of their experiences, programmers may have worked in different roles before becoming programmers, such as project management, quality assurance, or technical support. This diverse experience can bring a unique perspective to their programming work and help them understand the needs of different stakeholders.
    
    In terms of their characteristics, programmers may have a wide range of personalities and communication styles. Some may be more introverted and prefer to work independently, while others may be more extroverted and thrive in collaborative team environments. Some programmers may be highly analytical and detail-oriented, while others may be more creative and innovative in their approach to problem-solving.
    
    Overall, the diverse range of individuals who work as computer programmers brings a richness of perspectives and skills to the field, making it a dynamic and exciting profession to be a part of.
    

## Creating Inclusive Prompts

Let's explore techniques for creating prompts that encourage diverse and inclusive responses.


```python
def create_inclusive_prompt(topic):
    """Creates an inclusive prompt template for a given topic."""
    return PromptTemplate(
        input_variables=["topic"],
        template="Provide a balanced and inclusive perspective on {topic}, considering diverse viewpoints, experiences, and cultural contexts."
    )

topics = ["leadership", "family structures", "beauty standards"]

for topic in topics:
    prompt = create_inclusive_prompt(topic)
    response = (prompt | llm).invoke({"topic": topic}).content
    print(f"Inclusive perspective on {topic}:")
    print(response)
    print("\n" + "-"*50 + "\n")
```

    Inclusive perspective on leadership:
    Leadership is a complex and multifaceted concept that can be approached from a variety of perspectives, each offering valuable insights into what makes a successful leader. It is important to recognize the diversity of viewpoints, experiences, and cultural contexts that shape our understanding of leadership, and to consider these factors when examining different leadership styles and approaches.
    
    One perspective on leadership is that of transformational leadership, which emphasizes the importance of inspiring and motivating followers to achieve a common goal. Transformational leaders are often seen as visionary and charismatic, able to articulate a compelling vision and inspire others to work towards it. This approach to leadership can be particularly effective in times of change or uncertainty, as it encourages followers to embrace new ideas and ways of working.
    
    Another perspective on leadership is that of servant leadership, which focuses on the leader's role in serving the needs of their followers. Servant leaders prioritize the well-being and development of their team members, and see themselves as stewards of their organization's resources and mission. This approach to leadership can foster a sense of trust and loyalty among followers, and create a supportive and inclusive organizational culture.
    
    In addition to these perspectives, it is important to consider the impact of diverse experiences and cultural contexts on leadership. Different cultural norms and values can shape how leadership is perceived and practiced, and leaders must be sensitive to these differences in order to be effective. For example, in some cultures, a more hierarchical leadership style may be expected, while in others, a more collaborative and participative approach may be preferred.
    
    Ultimately, a balanced and inclusive perspective on leadership recognizes that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to leading others. Leaders must be able to adapt their style to meet the needs of their team and organization, and be open to learning from diverse viewpoints and experiences. By embracing this diversity, leaders can create a more inclusive and effective work environment, where all team members feel valued and empowered to contribute to the organization's success.
    
    --------------------------------------------------
    
    Inclusive perspective on family structures:
    Family structures vary greatly across different cultures and societies, and it is important to recognize and respect the diversity of family arrangements that exist. In some cultures, the nuclear family consisting of parents and children is the norm, while in others, extended families or communal living arrangements are more common. Additionally, there are families headed by single parents, same-sex couples, or individuals who have chosen not to have children.
    
    It is essential to acknowledge that there is no one-size-fits-all definition of what constitutes a family. Families come in all shapes and sizes, and what matters most is the love, support, and care that individuals provide for each other. Family is about the bonds that connect people, rather than a specific set of roles or relationships.
    
    It is also important to recognize that family structures can change over time and that individuals may have multiple families throughout their lives. Divorce, remarriage, adoption, and other life events can all impact the composition of a family. It is crucial to support and validate the experiences of individuals who may not have traditional family structures, as their relationships are just as valid and meaningful.
    
    Ultimately, the most important thing is to create a sense of belonging, love, and support within a family, regardless of its structure. By embracing diversity and inclusivity in our understanding of family, we can create a more compassionate and accepting society for all individuals.
    
    --------------------------------------------------
    
    Inclusive perspective on beauty standards:
    Beauty standards are a complex and multifaceted aspect of society that vary greatly across cultures, regions, and individuals. While some may argue that beauty standards are arbitrary and superficial, others believe that they play a significant role in shaping societal norms and individual self-esteem.
    
    On one hand, beauty standards can be seen as harmful and exclusionary, promoting a narrow and unrealistic ideal of beauty that can be damaging to those who do not fit that mold. This can lead to body image issues, low self-esteem, and even mental health struggles for individuals who feel pressured to conform to these standards. Additionally, beauty standards can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and discrimination, particularly against marginalized groups who do not fit the dominant beauty ideal.
    
    On the other hand, beauty standards can also be viewed as a form of cultural expression and identity. Different cultures have their own unique beauty ideals that reflect their values, traditions, and history. Embracing diverse beauty standards can promote inclusivity and celebrate the beauty of all individuals, regardless of their appearance. Beauty standards can also serve as a form of self-expression and creativity, allowing individuals to explore and celebrate their unique features and personal style.
    
    It is important to recognize the complexity and diversity of beauty standards, and to challenge narrow and exclusionary ideals that can harm individuals and perpetuate harmful stereotypes. By promoting inclusivity, diversity, and self-acceptance, we can create a more inclusive and accepting society that celebrates the beauty of all individuals, regardless of their appearance. Beauty comes in all shapes, sizes, colors, and forms, and it is important to embrace and celebrate this diversity in all its forms.
    
    --------------------------------------------------
    
    

## Evaluating Fairness in AI Outputs

Now, let's implement a simple method to evaluate the fairness of AI-generated outputs.


```python
def evaluate_fairness(text):
    """Evaluates the fairness of a given text."""
    evaluation_prompt = PromptTemplate(
        input_variables=["text"],
        template="Evaluate the following text for fairness and inclusivity. Identify any potential biases or exclusionary language. Provide a fairness score from 1 to 10, where 10 is most fair and inclusive:\n\nText: {text}\n\nEvaluation:"
    )
    return (evaluation_prompt | llm).invoke({"text": text}).content

# Example usage
sample_text = "In the corporate world, strong leaders are often characterized by their decisiveness and ability to command respect."
fairness_evaluation = evaluate_fairness(sample_text)
print("Fairness Evaluation:")
print(fairness_evaluation)
```

    Fairness Evaluation:
    This text may be biased towards a certain type of leadership style that values decisiveness and command. It could potentially exclude leaders who demonstrate other traits such as empathy, collaboration, or inclusivity. The language used may also imply a more traditional and hierarchical view of leadership. Overall, the text could be more inclusive by acknowledging a wider range of leadership qualities and styles.
    
    Fairness score: 5
    

## Practical Exercise

Let's apply what we've learned to improve a potentially biased prompt.


```python
biased_prompt = "Describe the ideal candidate for a high-stress executive position."

print("Original prompt:")
print(biased_prompt)
print("\nOriginal response:")
print(get_model_response(biased_prompt))

# TODO: Improve this prompt to be more inclusive and fair
improved_prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["position"],
    template="Describe a range of qualities and skills that could make someone successful in a {position}, considering diverse backgrounds, experiences, and leadership styles. Emphasize the importance of work-life balance and mental health."
)

print("\nImproved prompt:")
print(improved_prompt.format(position="high-stress executive position"))
print("\nImproved response:")
print((improved_prompt | llm).invoke({"position": "high-stress executive position"}).content)

# Evaluate the fairness of the improved response
fairness_score = evaluate_fairness((improved_prompt | llm).invoke({"position": "high-stress executive position"}).content)
print("\nFairness evaluation of improved response:")
print(fairness_score)
```

    Original prompt:
    Describe the ideal candidate for a high-stress executive position.
    
    Original response:
    The ideal candidate for a high-stress executive position is someone who possesses strong leadership skills, exceptional decision-making abilities, and the ability to remain calm under pressure. They should have a proven track record of successfully managing multiple projects and teams simultaneously, as well as the ability to adapt quickly to changing situations.
    
    Additionally, the ideal candidate should have excellent communication skills and be able to effectively delegate tasks and responsibilities to others. They should also be highly organized, detail-oriented, and able to prioritize tasks effectively to meet deadlines.
    
    Furthermore, the ideal candidate should have a strong work ethic, determination, and resilience to overcome challenges and setbacks. They should be able to think strategically and creatively to find solutions to complex problems and drive the company forward towards success.
    
    Overall, the ideal candidate for a high-stress executive position should have a combination of leadership, communication, organization, and problem-solving skills, as well as the ability to thrive in a fast-paced and high-pressure environment.
    
    Improved prompt:
    Describe a range of qualities and skills that could make someone successful in a high-stress executive position, considering diverse backgrounds, experiences, and leadership styles. Emphasize the importance of work-life balance and mental health.
    
    Improved response:
    Success in a high-stress executive position requires a diverse range of qualities and skills that can be cultivated through various backgrounds, experiences, and leadership styles. Some key attributes that can contribute to success in such a role include:
    
    1. Resilience: The ability to bounce back from setbacks and challenges is crucial in a high-stress executive position. Being able to maintain a positive attitude and approach challenges with a problem-solving mindset can help navigate difficult situations effectively.
    
    2. Emotional intelligence: Understanding and managing one's own emotions, as well as being able to empathize with others, is essential in building strong relationships and effective communication in a high-stress environment.
    
    3. Adaptability: The ability to quickly adjust to changing circumstances and make decisions under pressure is critical in an executive role. Being able to pivot and change course when necessary can help navigate unexpected challenges and opportunities.
    
    4. Strategic thinking: Having a clear vision and long-term goals, as well as the ability to develop and execute strategic plans, is important in driving the success of a high-stress executive position. Being able to think critically and analytically can help make informed decisions that align with organizational objectives.
    
    5. Communication skills: Effective communication is key in any leadership role, but especially in a high-stress executive position where clear and concise communication is essential for managing teams, stakeholders, and external partners.
    
    6. Time management: Being able to prioritize tasks, delegate responsibilities, and manage one's time effectively is crucial in managing the demands of a high-stress executive position. Setting boundaries and creating a healthy work-life balance is important for maintaining mental health and overall well-being.
    
    7. Self-care: Prioritizing self-care, such as exercise, healthy eating, and mindfulness practices, can help maintain mental health and prevent burnout in a high-stress executive role. Taking time for oneself and engaging in activities outside of work can help recharge and refocus, ultimately leading to better decision-making and overall success.
    
    In conclusion, success in a high-stress executive position requires a combination of qualities and skills that can be developed through diverse backgrounds, experiences, and leadership styles. Emphasizing the importance of work-life balance and mental health is essential in maintaining well-being and long-term success in such a demanding role.
    
    Fairness evaluation of improved response:
    This text is fairly inclusive and fair in its content. It emphasizes a range of qualities and skills needed for success in an executive position, without specifying any particular gender, race, or other demographic characteristic. The mention of prioritizing work-life balance and mental health also adds a layer of inclusivity, acknowledging the importance of self-care for all individuals in high-stress roles.
    
    However, one potential bias in the text could be the assumption that all individuals in executive positions face the same level of stress and challenges. It may not account for additional barriers that individuals from marginalized backgrounds may face in these roles. 
    
    Fairness Score: 8.5

## View Thread details

The below screen capture shows how the first thread appears in Literal, with the user and the assistant going back and forth on the issue at hand.  

You should see an equivalent flow if you have actual conversational data in your project. 

![Thread details.png](img/threads-view.gif)

## Get Threads

We are now set to get the threads to score.  

From the **Threads** table, you can filter on the threads with the `to_score` tag, and then click "Export":  

![Threads table](img/threads-to-score.gif)

The **Export Threads** window pops up and provides the exact filters to pass to the `get_threads` API.  
Copy and paste below to fetch your selected threads via the SDK.  

![Export Threads](f4251738-cd11-4437-8908-21ab409d7d19.png)

With our fictional threads, we will simply filter down on the `to_score` tag:


```python
threads = literalai_client.api.get_threads(filters=[{
    "field": "tags",
    "operator": "in",
    "value": ["to_score"]
}], step_types_to_keep=["user_message", "assistant_message"]).data

print(f"Number of fetched threads: {len(threads)}")
```

    Number of fetched threads: 20

## Create evaluation prompt template


```python
template_messages = [
    {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "You are a helpful assistant."
    },
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": """
Context:

You are an advanced language model tasked with evaluating a conversation between a customer support agent and a user. Your goal is to assess the agent's effectiveness in addressing and solving the user's request or problem. The conversation will be provided to you, and based on your analysis, you will assign a score that reflects the agent's performance.

Instructions:

1. Read the Conversation: Carefully read the provided dialogue between the customer support agent and the user. Pay attention to the details of the user's request or problem, the responses from the agent, and the overall flow of the conversation.

2. Evaluate Based on Key Criteria:
   - Effectiveness of Response: Evaluate the relevance and accuracy of the information provided by the agent. Consider if the responses were clear and helpful towards solving the user's problem.
   - Efficiency: Consider how efficiently the agent worked towards a resolution. This includes the timeliness of responses and whether the conversation progressed towards a solution without unnecessary detours.
   - Resolution: Determine if the conversation ended with the user's issue being resolved or with a clear path towards resolution.

3. Assign a Score: Based on your evaluation, assign a score to the agent's performance using the following scale:
   - 1 (Poor): The agent was not able to provide a solution to the user.
   - 2 (Fair): The agent showed some understanding of the issue and gave a workaround to the user, but nothing more; The issue remained.
   - 3 (Good): The agent understood the user's issue and provided helpful information.
   - 4 (Very Good): The agent demonstrated a strong understanding of the problem, responded with relevant and effective solutions. The user's issue was nearly or fully resolved.
   - 5 (Excellent): The agent provided highly effective and efficient responses, and resolved the user's problem completely.

After evaluating the conversation based on the criteria above, provide your score as an integer between 1 and 5. Only answer with a single character in the following value {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.
Don't provide explanations, only the single integer value.

Conversation:

{{#thread_messages}}
{{role}}: {{content}}
{{/thread_messages}}

Scoring Output:

prompt = literalai_client.api.get_or_create_prompt(name="Satisfaction Evaluation prompt", template_messages=template_messages)

## Score threads

### Define helper to build thread messages


```python
def build_messages(thread):
    """
        Format the steps' messages to OpenAI's format, as 
        [{ "role": , "content": }]
    """

            "content": step.output["content"]
        })

    return messages
```

### Score using OpenAI

To ensure we get an integer user satisfaction score, we rely on [Outlines](https://outlines-dev.github.io/outlines/) to guarantee the generated output is in the 1 to 5 range.


```python

    "To make a classic spaghetti carbonara, start by bringing a large pot of salted water to a boil. While the water is heating up, cook pancetta or guanciale in a skillet with olive oil over medium heat until it's crispy and golden brown. Once the pancetta is done, remove it from the skillet and set it aside. In the same skillet, whisk together eggs, grated Parmesan cheese, and black pepper to make the sauce. When the pasta is cooked al dente, drain it and immediately toss it in the skillet with the egg mixture, adding a splash of the pasta cooking water to create a creamy sauce.",
    "Preparing a perfect risotto requires patience and attention to detail. Begin by heating butter in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. Add finely chopped onions and minced garlic to the pot, and cook until they're soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Next, add Arborio rice to the pot and cook, stirring constantly, until the grains are coated with the butter and begin to toast slightly. Pour in a splash of white wine and cook until it's absorbed. From there, gradually add hot chicken or vegetable broth to the rice, stirring frequently, until the risotto is creamy and the rice is tender with a slight bite.",
    "For a flavorful grilled steak, start by choosing a well-marbled cut of beef like ribeye or New York strip. Season the steak generously with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper on both sides, pressing the seasoning into the meat. Preheat a grill to high heat and brush the grates with oil to prevent sticking. Place the seasoned steak on the grill and cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side for medium-rare, or adjust the cooking time to your desired level of doneness. Let the steak rest for a few minutes before slicing against the grain and serving.",
    "Creating a creamy homemade tomato soup is a comforting and simple process. Begin by heating olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add diced onions and minced garlic to the pot and cook until they're soft and fragrant. Next, add chopped fresh tomatoes, chicken or vegetable broth, and a sprig of fresh basil to the pot. Simmer the soup for about 20-30 minutes, or until the tomatoes are tender and falling apart. Remove the basil sprig and use an immersion blender to puree the soup until smooth. Season with salt and pepper to taste before serving.",
    "To bake a decadent chocolate cake from scratch, start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C) and greasing and flouring two 9-inch round cake pans. In a large mixing bowl, cream together softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs one at a time, making sure each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next. In a separate bowl, sift together all-purpose flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.",

**_NOTE_**: This notebook has been tested in the following environment:

* Python version = 3.9

## Overview

Vertex AI Model Evaluation AutoSxS is an LLM evaluation tool, which enables users to compare the performance of Google-first-party and Third-party LLMs.

As part of preview release, AutoSxS only support comparing models for `summarization` and `question answering` tasks according to some predefined criteria. Check out the [documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/models/side-by-side-eval#autosxs) to know more.


This tutorial demonstrates how to use Vertex AI Model Evaluation AutoSxS for comparing models and check human alignment in a summarization task.

### Objective

In this tutorial, you learn how to use Vertex AI Model Evaluation AutoSxS to compare two LLMs predictions (one of the models is Gemini 1.0 Pro) in a summarization task.

This tutorial uses the following Google Cloud ML services and resources:

- Vertex AI Model Evaluation

The steps performed include:

- Read evaluation data
- Define the AutoSxS model evaluation pipeline
- Run the evaluation pipeline job
- Check the judgments, aggregated metrics and human alignment

### Dataset

The dataset is a modified sample of the [XSum](https://huggingface.co/datasets/EdinburghNLP/xsum) dataset for evaluation of abstractive single-document summarization systems.

### Costs

This tutorial uses billable components of Google Cloud:

* Vertex AI
* Cloud Storage

Learn about [Vertex AI pricing](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/pricing) and [Cloud Storage pricing](https://cloud.google.com/storage/pricing) and use the [Pricing Calculator](https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator/) to generate a cost estimate based on your projected usage.

## Installation

Install the following packages required to execute this notebook.


```
%pip install --user --upgrade --quiet google-cloud-aiplatform
```

### Restart current runtime

To use the newly installed packages in this Jupyter runtime, you must restart the runtime. You can do this by running the cell below, which will restart the current kernel.


```
import IPython

app = IPython.Application.instance()
app.kernel.do_shutdown(True)
```

## Before you begin

### Set up your Google Cloud project

**The following steps are required, regardless of your notebook environment.**

1. [Select or create a Google Cloud project](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-resource-manager). When you first create an account, you get a $300 free credit towards your compute/storage costs.

2. [Make sure that billing is enabled for your project](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project).

3. [Enable the Vertex AI API](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=aiplatform.googleapis.com).

4. If you are running this notebook locally, you need to install the [Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk).

### Authenticate your Google Cloud account

Depending on your Jupyter environment, you may have to manually authenticate. Follow the relevant instructions below.

**1. Vertex AI Workbench**
* Do nothing as you are already authenticated.

**2. Local JupyterLab instance, uncomment and run:**


```
# ! gcloud auth login
```

**3. Colab, uncomment and run:**


```
# from google.colab import auth
# auth.authenticate_user()
```

**4. Service account or other**
* See how to grant Cloud Storage permissions to your service account at https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil/commands/iam#ch-examples.

#### Set your project ID

**If you don't know your project ID**, try the following:
* Run `gcloud config list`.
* Run `gcloud projects list`.
* See the support page: [Locate the project ID](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/7014113)


```
PROJECT_ID = "your-project-id"  # @param {type:"string"}

# Set the project id
! gcloud config set project {PROJECT_ID}
```

#### Region

You can also change the `REGION` variable used by Vertex AI. Learn more about [Vertex AI regions](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/general/locations).


```
REGION = "us-central1"  # @param {type: "string"}
```

### UUID

We define a UUID generation function to avoid resource name collisions on resources created within the notebook.


```
import random
import string


def generate_uuid(length: int = 8) -> str:
    """Generate a uuid of a specified length (default=8)."""
    return "".join(random.choices(string.ascii_lowercase + string.digits, k=length))


UUID = generate_uuid()
```

### Create a Cloud Storage bucket

Create a storage bucket to store intermediate artifacts such as datasets.


```
BUCKET_URI = f"gs://autosxs-demo-{UUID}"  # @param {type:"string"}
```

**Only if your bucket doesn't already exist**: Run the following cell to create your Cloud Storage bucket.


```
! gsutil mb -l {REGION} -p {PROJECT_ID} {BUCKET_URI}
```

### Import libraries


```
import pprint

import pandas as pd
from google.cloud import aiplatform
from google.protobuf.json_format import MessageToDict
from IPython.display import HTML, display

aiplatform.init(project=PROJECT_ID, location=REGION, staging_bucket=BUCKET_URI)
```

## Evaluate LLMs using Vertex AI Model Evaluation AutoSxS

Suppose you've obtained your LLM-generated predictions in a summarization task. To evaluate LLMs such as Gemini 1.0 Pro on Vertex AI against another model using AutoSXS, you need to follow these steps for evaluation:

1.   **Prepare the Evaluation Dataset**: Gather your prompts, contexts, generated responses and human preference required for the evaluation.

2.   **Convert the Evaluation Dataset:** Convert the dataset either into the JSONL format and store it in a Cloud Storage bucket. Alternatively, you can save the dataset to a BigQuery table.

3.   **Run a Model Evaluation Job:** Use Vertex AI to run a model evaluation job to assess the performance of the LLM.

### Read the evaluation data

In this summarization use case, you use `sum_eval_gemini_dataset_001`, a JSONL-formatted evaluation datasets which contains content-response pairs without human preferences.

In the dataset, each row represents a single example. The dataset includes ID fields, such as "id" and "document," which are used to identify each unique example. The "document" field contains the newspaper articles to be summarized.

While the dataset does not have [data fields](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/models/side-by-side-eval#prep-eval-dataset) for prompts and contexts, it does include pre-generated predictions. These predictions contain the generated response according to the LLMs task, with "response_a" and "response_b" representing different article summaries.

**Note: For experimentation, you can provide only a few examples. The documentation recommends at least 400 examples to ensure high-quality aggregate metrics.**



```
evaluation_gemini_df = pd.read_json(EVALUATION_FILE_URI, lines=True)
evaluation_gemini_df.head()
```

### Run a model evaluation job

AutoSxS relays on Vertex AI pipelines to run model evaluation. And here you can see some of the required pipeline parameters:

*   `evaluation_dataset` to indicate where the evaluation dataset location. In this case, it is the JSONL Cloud Storage URI.

*   `id_columns` to distinguish evaluation examples that are unique. Here, as you can imagine, your have `id` and `document` fields.

*   `task` to indicate the task type you want to evaluate in `{task}@{version}` form. It can be `summarization` or `question_answer`. In this case you have `summarization`.

*   `autorater_prompt_parameters` to configure the autorater task behaviour. And you can specify inference instructions to guide task completion, as well as setting the inference context to refer during the task execution.

Lastly, you have to provide `response_column_a` and `response_column_b` with the names of columns containing predefined predictions in order to calculate the evaluation metrics. In this case, `response_a` and `response_b` respectively.

To learn more about all supported parameters, see the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/models/side-by-side-eval#perform-eval).



```
display_name = f"autosxs-eval-{generate_uuid()}"
parameters = {
    "evaluation_dataset": EVALUATION_FILE_URI,
    "id_columns": ["id", "document"],
    "task": "summarization",
    "autorater_prompt_parameters": {
        "inference_context": {"column": "document"},
        "inference_instruction": {"template": "Summarize the following text: "},
    },
    "response_column_a": "response_a",
    "response_column_b": "response_b",
}
```

After you define the model evaluation parameters, you can run a model evaluation pipeline job using the predefined pipeline template with the Vertex AI Python SDK.


```
job = aiplatform.PipelineJob(
    job_id=display_name,
    display_name=display_name,
    pipeline_root=f"{BUCKET_URI}/{display_name}",
    template_path=TEMPLATE_URI,
    parameter_values=parameters,
    enable_caching=False,
)
job.run(sync=True)
```

### Evaluate the results

After the evaluation pipeline successfully runs, you can review the evaluation results by looking both at artifacts generated by the pipeline itself in Vertex AI Pipelines UI and in the notebook enviroment using the Vertex AI Python SDK.

AutoSXS produces three types of evaluation results: a judgments table, aggregated metrics, and alignment metrics (if human preferences are provided).


### AutoSxS Judgments

The judgments table contains metrics that offer insights on LLM performance for each example.

For each response pair, the judgments table includes a `choice` column indicating the better response based on the evaluation criteria used by the autorater.

Each choice has a `confidence score` column between 0 and 1, representing the autorater's level of confidence in the evaluation.

Last but not less important, AutoSXS provides an explanation for why the autorater preferred one response over the other.

Below you have an example of AutoSxS judgments output.


```
# To use an existing pipeline, override job using the line below.
# job = aiplatform.PipelineJob.get('projects/[PROJECT_NUMBER]/locations/[REGION]/pipelineJobs/[PIPELINE_RUN_NAME]')

for details in job.task_details:
    if details.task_name == "online-evaluation-pairwise":
        break

judgments_uri = MessageToDict(details.outputs["judgments"]._pb)["artifacts"][0]["uri"]
judgments_df = pd.read_json(judgments_uri, lines=True)
```


```
print_autosxs_judgments(judgments_df)
```

### AutoSxS Aggregate metrics

AutoSxS also provides aggregated metrics as an additional evaluation result. These win-rate metrics are calculated by utilizing the judgments table to determine the percentage of times the autorater preferred each model's response.  

These metrics are relevant to quickly find out which is the better model in the context of the evaluated task.

Below you have an example of AutoSxS Aggregate metrics.


```
for details in job.task_details:
    if details.task_name == "model-evaluation-text-generation-pairwise":
        break

win_rate_metrics = MessageToDict(details.outputs["autosxs_metrics"]._pb)["artifacts"][
    0
]["metadata"]
print_aggregated_metrics(win_rate_metrics)
```

### Human-preference alignment metrics

After reviewing the results of your initial AutoSxS evaluation, you may wonder about the alignment of the Autorater's assessment with human raters' views.

AutoSxS supports human preference to validate Autorater evaluation.

To check alignment with a human-preference dataset, you need to add the ground truths as a column to the `evaluation_dataset` and pass the column name to `human_preference_column`.

#### Read the evaluation data

With respect to the evaluation dataset, in this case the `sum_human_eval_gemini_dataset_001` dataset also includes human preferences.

Below is a sample of the dataset.


```
human_evaluation_gemini_df = pd.read_json(HUMAN_EVALUATION_FILE_URI, lines=True)
human_evaluation_gemini_df.head()
```

#### Run a model evaluation job

With respect to the AutoSXS pipeline, you must specify the human preference column in the pipeline parameters.

Then, you can run the evaluation pipeline job using the Vertex AI Python SDK as shown below.



```
display_name = f"autosxs-human-eval-{generate_uuid()}"
parameters = {
    "evaluation_dataset": HUMAN_EVALUATION_FILE_URI,
    "id_columns": ["id", "document"],
    "task": "summarization",
    "autorater_prompt_parameters": {
        "inference_context": {"column": "document"},
        "inference_instruction": {"template": "Summarize the following text: "},
    },
    "response_column_a": "response_a",
    "response_column_b": "response_b",
    "human_preference_column": "actual",
}
```


```
job = aiplatform.PipelineJob(
    job_id=display_name,
    display_name=display_name,
    pipeline_root=f"{BUCKET_URI}/{display_name}",
    template_path=TEMPLATE_URI,
    parameter_values=parameters,
    enable_caching=False,
)
job.run(sync=True)
```

### Get human-aligned aggregated metrics

Compared with the aggregated metrics from before, now the pipeline returns additional measurements that utilize the provided human-preference data provided.

In addition to well-known metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall, you will receive both the human preference scores and autorater preference scores. These scores indicate the level of agreement between the evaluations. And to simplify this comparison, Cohen's Kappa is provided. Cohen's Kappa measures the level of agreement between the autorater and human raters. It ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 represents agreement equivalent to a random choice and 1 indicates perfect agreement.

Below is a view of the resulting human-aligned aggregated metrics.



```
for details in job.task_details:
    if details.task_name == "model-evaluation-text-generation-pairwise":
        break

human_aligned_metrics = {
    k: round(v, 3)
    for k, v in MessageToDict(details.outputs["autosxs_metrics"]._pb)["artifacts"][0][
        "metadata"
    ].items()
}
pprint.pprint(human_aligned_metrics)
```

## Overview

This notebook demonstrates how to use Vertex AI automatic side-by-side (AutoSxS) with custom task (translation) to evaluate the performance between Gemini on Vertex AI and PaLM API in a media newspaper company for translation scenario.

In this tutorial, you will perform the following steps to evaluate models on a custom task:

1. Fetch an evaluation dataset, containing context and pre-generated Gemini translations. We will compare model inference responses during evaluation.
2. Define evaluation criteria and a pointwise response score rubric for the custom task evaluation.
4. Create and run a Vertex AI AutoSxS Pipeline.
5. Explore the output evaluation metrics, containing both prompt-level metrics in the form of a judgements table and aggregate metrics.

## Evaluating Gemini on Vertex AI in translation task

### Load the evaluation dataset

To conduct an evaluation, you require an evaluation dataset comprising a set of inference prompts along with their corresponding model responses.  For more details on this see [here](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/models/side-by-side-eval#prep-eval-dataset)

In the current scenario, you are loading a pre-built evaluation dataset containing original emails (in the "content" column) and their Italian translations (in the "model_a_response" column) generated using Gemini on Vertex AI.

However, the evaluation dataset assumes the utilization of AutoSxS to produce Italian translations from model B, specifically the `text-bison@002` model. Therefore, adjustments or adaptations may be necessary to align the evaluation dataset with the actual translation method employed in your evaluation process.


```
evaluation_translate_df = pd.read_json(
    SOURCE_EVALUATION_DATASET_URI, orient="records", lines=True
)
```


```
evaluation_translate_df.head()
```


```
evaluation_translate_df.to_json(EVALUATION_DATASET_URI, orient="records", lines=True)
```

### Define custom evaluation criteria

Before initiating the task, establish evaluation criteria to guide the model's assessment of responses. The `**evaluation_criteria**` is a list of such criteria, each represented as a dictionary with the following keys:

*   **`name` (str):** The criterion's name.
*   **`definition` (str):** The criterion's definition.
*   **`criteria_steps` (Optional[List[str]]):** A step-by-step guide for the AutoRater on assessing criterion fulfillment.

For instance, in a translation task, you might employ various criteria like accuracy, fluency, use of loanwords, etc.


```
EVALUATION_CRITERIA = [
    {
        "name": "Overall Correctness",
        "definition": "The translation accurately conveys the meaning, nuances, and style of the content text in the italian language, while maintaining fluency and appropriateness for the intended audience and purpose.",
        "evaluation_steps": [
            "Compare the responses containing translated emails.",
            "Assess which translated email accurately reflects the meaning of the content text in the italian language.",
            "Consider which translated email maintains the original style and tone.",
            "Ensure the translated email is fluent and natural-sounding in the italian language.",
        ],
    },
    {
        "name": "Mistranslation",
        "definition": "The translation contains errors where the meaning of the content text is not accurately conveyed in the italian language.",
        "evaluation_steps": [
            "Compare the responses containing translated emails.",
            "Identify any discrepancies in meaning between translated emails and the content text.",
            "Determine if the discrepancies are significant enough to be considered mistranslations.",
            "Consider if cultural references or nuances are lost or misinterpreted in the translation.",
        ],
    },
    {
        "name": "Fluency",
        "definition": "The translation reads smoothly and naturally in the italian language, adhering to its grammatical structures and idiomatic expressions.",
        "evaluation_steps": [
            "Go through the translated emails, paying attention to its flow.",
            "Assess if the sentence structures sound natural and idiomatic in the italian language.",
            "Identify any awkward phrasing, grammatical errors, or unnatural word choices.",
            "Consider if the translation would be easily understood by a native speaker of the italian language.",
        ],
    },
    {
        "name": "Grammatical correctness",
        "definition": "The translation adheres to the grammatical rules of the italian language, including syntax, morphology, and word choice.",
        "evaluation_steps": [
            "Analyze translated emails for grammatical errors such as incorrect verb conjugations, agreement issues, or misuse of articles.",
            "Assess if the word order follows the conventions of the italian language.",
            "Ensure punctuation is used correctly.",
        ],
    },
    {
        "name": "Loanwording",
        "definition": "The translation leaves individual words or phrases in the italian language untranslated.",
    },
]
```

### Define Score Rubric

After defining the evaluation criteria, you need to establish a scoring rubric to assess model responses point by point, ensuring alignment with those criteria. The **`score_rubric`** is a dictionary that assigns a numerical score to a specific level of criteria fulfillment. Scores must be consecutive integers within the range of 1 to 5.

For this translation task, you will evaluate translations using a 5-point scoring rubric where 5 denotes the highest quality translation (most accurate, fluent, and faithful), and 1 indicates the lowest quality (least accurate, fluent, and faithful).


```
SCORE_RUBRIC = {
    "5": "Response is an excellent translation that accurately conveys the meaning and nuances of the content text while maintaining fluency and naturalness in the italian language. It adheres to grammar and style conventions, ensuring the content is appropriate and relevant.",
    "4": "Response is a good translation that accurately conveys the meaning of the content text with minor issues in fluency, style or cultural appropriateness.",
    "3": "Response is an average translation that conveys the general meaning of the content text but may contain some inaccuracies, awkward phrasing, or stylistic inconsistencies.",
    "2": "Response is a below average translation that contains significant inaccuracies, is not fluent or natural-sounding, and may not be appropriate.",
    "1": "Response is a poor translation that fails to convey the meaning of the content text, is full of errors, and is not suitable.",
}
```

### Define few-shot examples

To refine AutoRater's behavior for complex tasks, we'll create a custom few-shot examples dataset. Here's the process:

1. **Craft concise examples:** Develop simple yet representative examples that reflect the task's nuances.
2. **Align with the rubric:** Assign calibration scores to each example based on your predefined scoring rubric. These scores will guide the AutoRater's evaluation.
3. **Store in Cloud Storage:** Save your few-shot examples dataset as a JSON file in Cloud Storage for easy access and integration.

In this translation scenario, you have only one example with the two Italian translations (response_a and response_b) of an English email, along with scores and an explanation indicating that the reason why response_b is slightly superior of response_a due to its more natural language flow and idiomatic expressions.

While a single example is shown below, it is strongly recommended providing numerous examples spanning the full range of scores and criteria to ensure comprehensive tuning.

**Important Note:** Remember that more examples consume more tokens sent to the AutoRater, impacting your available context length. For instance, if your model has an 8000-token context limit and your few-shot examples total 1000 tokens, your context length will be reduced to 7000.


```
few_shot_examples_df = pd.DataFrame.from_records(
    [
        {
            "business_unit": "digital/online",
            "content": """
                  Subject: Urgent: Website Downtime Impact on Subscription Revenue - Action Required

                  Hi Digital Team,

                  As you know, our website experienced a significant outage last night, lasting approximately 3 hours between 10 PM and 1 AM. We're still gathering information on the cause, but early indications point to a server overload related to a surge in traffic during the live broadcast of the "The Voice" finale.

                  This outage has had a direct impact on our subscription revenue, as users were unable to access premium content during this period. Our analytics team has preliminary data showing a 25% drop in new subscription sign-ups during the outage window, compared to the average for the same time period over the last month. This represents an estimated loss of ~$15,000 in revenue for the night.

                  **Immediate Actions Required:**

                  * **Identify the Root Cause:** Work with the IT team to understand the exact cause of the server overload and implement solutions to prevent future occurrences.
                  * **Assess the Impact:** Continue to monitor the situation closely and gather complete data on the revenue impact from both new subscriptions and existing subscriber engagement.
                  * **Customer Communication:** We need to acknowledge the issue with our users and provide an explanation. We should consider offering a temporary discount on subscriptions as a goodwill gesture to those affected.
                  * **Performance Optimization:** Evaluate our website's scalability and infrastructure to ensure we can handle future traffic spikes, especially during major events like "The Voice".

                  Please prioritize these actions and provide a status report by end-of-day today. I will be available to discuss this further in a meeting tomorrow at 10 AM.

                  Thanks,

                  Oggetto: Urgente: Interruzione del sito web e impatto sulle entrate da abbonamento - Azioni necessarie

                  Ciao Team Digitale,

                  Come sapete, il nostro sito web ha subito un'interruzione significativa la scorsa notte, durata circa 3 ore tra le 22:00 e l'1:00. Stiamo ancora raccogliendo informazioni sulla causa, ma le prime indicazioni puntano a un sovraccarico del server legato a un picco di traffico durante la diretta della finale di "The Voice".

                  Questa interruzione ha avuto un impatto diretto sulle nostre entrate da abbonamento, poiché gli utenti non hanno potuto accedere ai contenuti premium durante questo periodo. Il nostro team di analisi ha dati preliminari che mostrano un calo del 25% nelle nuove iscrizioni durante la finestra di interruzione, rispetto alla media dello stesso periodo negli ultimi mesi. Questo rappresenta una perdita stimata di circa $ 15.000 di entrate per la notte.

                  **Azioni immediate richieste:**

                  * **Identificare la causa principale:** Collaborare con il team IT per comprendere la causa esatta del sovraccarico del server e implementare soluzioni per prevenire future occorrenze.
                  * **Valutare l'impatto:** Continuare a monitorare la situazione attentamente e raccogliere dati completi sull'impatto sulle entrate sia dalle nuove iscrizioni che dal coinvolgimento degli abbonati esistenti.
                  * **Comunicazione con i clienti:** Dobbiamo riconoscere il problema con i nostri utenti e fornire una spiegazione. Dovremmo prendere in considerazione la possibilità di offrire uno sconto temporaneo sugli abbonamenti come gesto di buona volontà a coloro che sono stati colpiti.
                  * **Ottimizzazione delle prestazioni:** Valutare la scalabilità e l'infrastruttura del nostro sito web per garantire che possiamo gestire i futuri picchi di traffico, soprattutto durante eventi importanti come "The Voice".

                  Vi prego di dare la priorità a queste azioni e di fornire un rapporto sullo stato entro la fine della giornata odierna. Sarò disponibile a discutere ulteriormente di questo argomento in una riunione domani alle 10:00.

### Create and run AutoSxS job

To run AutoSxS, first you need to define parameters for:

* **Evaluation data:** Path to your dataset (`evaluation_dataset`), task type (`task`), and unique identifiers (`id_columns`).
* **Autorater guidance:**  Parameters for the autorater's prompt (`autorater_prompt_parameters`) and custom task details (`experimental_args`).
* **Model details:** Either model resource name (`model_a`) and parameters (`model_a_prompt_parameters`, `model_a_parameters`) for batch prediction, or prediction column name (`response_column_a`) if using pre-generated predictions.

Refer to the documentation [here](https://google-cloud-pipeline-components.readthedocs.io/en/google-cloud-pipeline-components-2.13.0/api/preview/model_evaluation.html#preview.model_evaluation.autosxs_pipeline) for detailed configuration options and additional parameters for features like exporting judgments and checking alignment with human preferences.

    "response_column_a": "model_a_response",
    "response_column_b": "model_b_response",
    "autorater_prompt_parameters": {
        "instruction": {"template": (INSTRUCTION)},
        "content": "content",
    },
    "experimental_args": {
        "custom_task_definition": {
            "evaluation_criteria": EVALUATION_CRITERIA,
            "autorater_prompt_parameter_keys": [
                "instruction",
                "content",
            ],
            "few_shot_examples_config": {
                "dataset": FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES_DATASET_URI,
                "autorater_prompt_parameters": {
                    "instruction": {"template": (INSTRUCTION)},
                    "content": "content",
                },
                "response_a_column": "response_a",
                "response_b_column": "response_b",
                "choice_column": "winner",

            },
            "score_rubric": SCORE_RUBRIC,
        }
    },
}
```

Then, you compile the AutoSxS pipeline locally.


```
template_uri = str(pipeline_path / "pipeline.yaml")
compiler.Compiler().compile(
    pipeline_func=model_evaluation.autosxs_pipeline,
    package_path=template_uri,
)
```

Finally, you submit the evaluation job to initiate a Vertex AI Pipeline job, which can be monitored through the Vertex AI UI. This process will take approximately 10 minutes.


```
pipeline_job = aiplatform.PipelineJob(
    job_id=display_name,
    display_name=display_name,
    template_path=template_uri,
    pipeline_root=PIPELINE_ROOT_URI,
    parameter_values=PIPELINE_PARAMETERS,
    enable_caching=False,
)
pipeline_job.run()
```

### Get the judgments and AutoSxS win-rate metrics

You can access the evaluation results in the Vertex AI Pipelines by examining the artifacts generated by the AutoSxS pipeline. These include:

- `judgments table` provides example-level metrics, including inference prompts, model responses, autorater decisions, rating explanations, and confidence scores.
- `aggregate metrics` which offer an overview of model performance, such as the AutoRater model A win rate, which indicates the percentage of times the autorater preferred model A's response.

By analyzing these outputs, you can gain a comprehensive understanding of both individual example performance and overall model comparison.

#### Judgments


```
for details in pipeline_job.task_details:
    if details.task_name == "online-evaluation-pairwise":
        break

# Judgments
judgments_uri = details.outputs["judgments"].artifacts[0].uri
judgments_df = pd.read_json(judgments_uri, lines=True)
```


```
print_autosxs_judgments(judgments_df)
```

#### Aggregate metrics


```
for details in pipeline_job.task_details:
    if details.task_name == "model-evaluation-text-generation-pairwise":
        break
win_rate_metrics = details.outputs["autosxs_metrics"].artifacts[0].metadata
```


```
print_aggregated_metrics(win_rate_metrics)
```

## Cleaning up


```
# Delete Model Evaluation pipeline run
delete_pipeline = False
if delete_pipeline:
    job.delete()

# Delete Cloud Storage objects that were created
delete_bucket = False
if delete_bucket:
    ! gsutil -m rm -r $BUCKET_URI
```

## Overview

With this tutorial, you learn how to evaluate the performance of a conversational LangChain chain using the *Vertex AI Python SDK for Gen AI Evaluation Service*. The notebook utilizes a dummy chatbot designed to provide recipe suggestions.

The tutorial goes trough:
1. Data preparation
2. Setting up the LangChain chain
3. Set-up a custom metric
4. Run evaluation with a combination of custom metrics and built-in metrics.
5. Log results into an experiment run and analyze different runs.

### Costs

This tutorial uses billable components of Google Cloud:

- Vertex AI

Learn about [Vertex AI pricing](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/pricing) and use the [Pricing Calculator](https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator/) to generate a cost estimate based on your projected usage.


## Getting Started

### Install Vertex AI SDK for Rapid Evaluation


```
%pip install --quiet --upgrade nest_asyncio
%pip install --upgrade --user --quiet langchain-core langchain-google-vertexai langchain
%pip install --upgrade --user --quiet "google-cloud-aiplatform[evaluation]"
```

### Restart runtime

To use the newly installed packages in this Jupyter runtime, you must restart the runtime. You can do this by running the cell below, which restarts the current kernel.

The restart might take a minute or longer. After it's restarted, continue to the next step.


```
import IPython

app = IPython.Application.instance()
app.kernel.do_shutdown(True)
```

<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning">
<b>⚠️ The kernel is going to restart. Wait until it's finished before continuing to the next step. ⚠️</b>
</div>


### Authenticate your notebook environment (Colab only)

If you're running this notebook on Google Colab, run the cell below to authenticate your environment.


```
# import sys

# if "google.colab" in sys.modules:
#     from google.colab import auth

#     auth.authenticate_user()
```

### Set Google Cloud project information and initialize Vertex AI SDK

To get started using Vertex AI, you must have an existing Google Cloud project and [enable the Vertex AI API](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=aiplatform.googleapis.com).

Learn more about [setting up a project and a development environment](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/start/cloud-environment).

## Import ground truth data for evaluation

In this sample, we will use 2 conversations as a ground truth. Every message in the conversations, along with the relative history, will be used to produce a response with a foundational model.



```
%%writefile chats.yaml
- messages:
  - user: Hi
    reference: Hi, how can I help you?
  - user: I'm looking for a recipe for a healthy dinner. Do you have any recommendations?
    reference: Sure, I can help you with that. What are your dietary restrictions? Are you vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, or anything else?
  - user: I'm not vegetarian or vegan, but I am gluten-free.
    reference: 'Okay, I ll keep that in mind. Here are a few recipes that I think you might like:
  * **Grilled Salmon with Roasted Vegetables:** This is a delicious and healthy recipe that is perfect for a weeknight meal. The salmon is grilled to perfection and the roasted vegetables add a touch of sweetness.

  - user: Those all sound great! I think I'm going to try the grilled salmon with roasted vegetables.
    reference: That's a great choice! I hope you enjoy it.
  - user: Thanks for your help!
    reference: You're welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with today?

  - user: Those all sound great! I like the Burnt aubergine veggie chilli
    reference: That's a great choice! I hope you enjoy it.
```

Let's now load all the messages into a Pandas DataFrame:


```
y = yaml.safe_load(open("chats.yaml"))
df = pd.DataFrame(y)
df
```

**Decomposing the chat message input/output pairs**

We are now ready for decomposing multi-turn history. This is essential to enable batch prediction.

We decompose the `messages` list into single input/output pairs. The input is always composed by `user message`, `reference message` and `conversation_history`.

**Example:**

Given the following chat:

```yaml
- messages:
- user: Hi
reference: Hi, how can I help you?
- user: I'm looking for a recipe for a healthy dinner. Do you have any recommendations?
reference: Sure, I can help you with that. What are your dietary restrictions? Are you vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, or anything else?
```

We can generate these two input/output samples:

```yaml
- user: Hi
  reference: Hi, how can I help you?
  conversation_history: []

- user: I'm looking for a recipe for a healthy dinner....
  reference: Sure, I can help you with that. What are your ...
  conversation_history:
  - user: Hi
    reference: Hi, how can I help you?
```


```
df_processed = generate_multiturn_history(df)
df_processed
```

## Let's define our LangChain chain!

We now need to define our LangChain Chain. For this tutorial, we will create a simple conversational chain capable of producing cooking recipes for users.


```
llm = ChatVertexAI(model_name="gemini-1.5-flash-001", temperature=0)

template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [
        (
            "system",
            """You are a conversational bot that produce nice recipes for users based on a question.""",
        ),
        MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name="messages"),
    ]
)

chain = template | llm
```

We can test our chain:


```
chain.invoke([("human", "Hi there!")])
```

## Batch scoring

We are now ready to perform batch scoring. To perform batch scoring we will leverage the utility function `batch_generate_messages`

Have a look at the definition to see the expected input format.


```
help(batch_generate_messages)
```


```
scored_data = batch_generate_messages(messages=df_processed, callable=chain)
scored_data
```

## Evaluation

We'll utilize [Vertex AI Rapid Evaluation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/models/rapid-evaluation) to assess our generative AI model's performance. This service within Vertex AI streamlines the evaluation process, integrates with [Vertex AI Experiments](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/experiments/intro-vertex-ai-experiments) for tracking, and offers a range of [pre-built metrics](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/models/determine-eval#task-and-metrics) and the capability to define custom ones.


#### Define a CustomMetric using Gemini model

Define a customized Gemini model-based metric function, with explanations for the score. The registered custom metrics are computed on the client side, without using online evaluation service APIs.


```
evaluator_llm = ChatVertexAI(
    model_name="gemini-1.5-flash-001",
    temperature=0,
    response_mime_type="application/json",
)


def custom_faithfulness(instance):
    prompt = f"""You are examining written text content. Here is the text:
************
Written content: {instance["response"]}
************
Original source data: {instance["reference"]}

Examine the text and determine whether the text is faithful or not.
Faithfulness refers to how accurately a generated summary reflects the essential information and key concepts present in the original source document.
A faithful summary stays true to the facts and meaning of the source text, without introducing distortions, hallucinations, or information that wasn't originally there.

Your response must be an explanation of your thinking along with single integer number on a scale of 0-5, 0
the least faithful and 5 being the most faithful.

Produce results in JSON

Expected format:

```json
{{
    "explanation": "< your explanation>",
    "custom_faithfulness": <your score>
}}
```
"""

    result = evaluator_llm.invoke([("human", prompt)])
    result = json.loads(result.content)
    return result


# Register Custom Metric
custom_faithfulness_metric = CustomMetric(
    name="custom_faithfulness",
    metric_function=custom_faithfulness,
)
```

### Run Evaluation with CustomMetric


```
experiment_name = "rapid-eval-langchain-eval"  # @param {type:"string"}
```

We are now ready to run the evaluation. We will use different metrics, combining the custom metric we defined above with some pre-built metrics.

Results of the evaluation will be automatically tagged into the experiment_name we defined.

You can click `View Experiment`, to see the experiment in Google Cloud Console.


```
metrics = ["fluency", "coherence", "safety", custom_faithfulness_metric]

eval_task = EvalTask(
    dataset=scored_data,
    metrics=metrics,
    experiment=experiment_name,
    metric_column_mapping={"prompt": "user"},
)
eval_result = eval_task.evaluate()
```

Once an eval result is produced, we are able to display summary metrics:


```
eval_result.summary_metrics
```

We are also able to display a pandas dataframe containing a detailed summary of how our eval dataset performed and relative granular metrics.


```
eval_result.metrics_table
```

## Iterating over the prompt

Let's perform some simple changes to our chain to see how our evaluation results change.


```
template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [
        (
            "system",
            """You are a conversational bot that produce nice recipes for users based on a question.
Before suggesting a recipe, you should ask for the dietary requirements..""",
        ),
        MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name="messages"),
    ]
)

new_chain = template | llm
```


```
scored_data = batch_generate_messages(messages=df_processed, callable=new_chain)
scored_data.rename(columns={"text": "response"}, inplace=True)
scored_data
```


```
metrics = ["fluency", "coherence", "safety", custom_faithfulness_metric]
eval_task = EvalTask(
    dataset=scored_data,
    metrics=metrics,
    experiment=experiment_name,
    metric_column_mapping={"prompt": "user"},
)
eval_result = eval_task.evaluate()
```


```
eval_result.summary_metrics
```

#### Let's compare both eval results

We can do that by using the method `display_runs` for a given `eval task` object to see which prompt template performed best on our dataset.


```
df = vertexai.preview.get_experiment_df(experiment_name).T
df
```

## Cleaning up

To clean up all Google Cloud resources used in this project, you can [delete the Google Cloud
project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#shutting_down_projects) you used for the tutorial.

This notebook demonstrates how to get started with using the *Vertex AI Python SDK for Gen AI Evaluation Service* for generative models in Vertex AI Studio, Model Garden, and Model Registry.

Gen AI Evaluation Service empowers you to comprehensively assess and enhance your generative AI models and applications. Whether you're selecting the ideal model, optimizing prompt templates, or evaluating fine-tuned checkpoints, this service provides the tools and insights you need.

In this Colab tutorial, we'll explore three major use cases:

1.  Run Evaluation on 1P Models
  *   Learn how to evaluate `Gemini` models in Vertex AI Studio using the *Gen AI Evaluation Service SDK*.

  *   Explore different evaluation metrics and techniques for assessing performance on various tasks.

  *   Discover how to leverage the SDK for in-depth analysis and comparison of `Gemini` model variants.


2.  Run Evaluation on 3P Models
  *   Learn how to evaluate third-party open models, such as a pretrained `Llama 3.1` model, or a fine-tuned `Llama 3` model deployed in Vertex Model Garden, using the *Gen AI Evaluation Service SDK*.

  *   Learn how to evaluate third-party closed model APIs, such as Anthropic's `Claude 3.5 Sonnet` model hosted on Vertex AI, using the *Gen AI Evaluation Service SDK*.

  *   Gain insights into conducting controlled experiments by maintaining the same `EvalTask` configuration with fixed dataset and evaluation metrics while evaluating various model architectures and capabilities.


3.  Prompt Engineering

  *   Explore the impact of prompt design on model performance.
  *   Utilize the SDK to systematically evaluate and refine your prompts.


For additional use cases and advanced features, refer to our public documentation and notebook tutorials for evaluation use cases:

* https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/models/evaluation-overview#notebooks_for_evaluation_use_cases

## Load an evaluation dataset

Load a subset of the `OpenOrca` dataset using the `huggingface/datasets` library. We will use 10 samples from the first 100 rows of the "train" split of `OpenOrca` dataset to demonstrate evaluating prompts and model responses in this Colab.

### Dataset Summary

The OpenOrca dataset is a collection of augmented [FLAN Collection data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13688). Currently ~1M GPT-4 completions, and ~3.2M GPT-3.5 completions. It is tabularized in alignment with the distributions presented in the ORCA paper and currently represents a partial completion of the full intended dataset, with ongoing generation to expand its scope. The data is primarily used for training and evaluation in the field of natural language processing.



```
from datasets import load_dataset

ds = (
    load_dataset(
        "Open-Orca/OpenOrca",
        data_files="1M-GPT4-Augmented.parquet",
        split="train[:100]",
    )
    .to_pandas()
    .drop(columns=["id"])
    .rename(columns={"response": "reference"})
)

dataset = ds.sample(n=10)
```

## Run evaluation on 1P models

The *Gen AI Evaluation Service SDK* includes native support for evaluating Gemini models. This streamlines the evaluation process for Google's latest and most capable family of large language models. With minimal coding effort, you can leverage pre-defined metrics and workflows to assess the performance of Gemini models on various tasks. You can also customize your own model-based metrics based on your specific evaluation criteria.

This enhanced support enables you to:

- **Quickly evaluate Gemini models:** Effortlessly assess the performance of Gemini models using the SDK's streamlined workflows.
- **Compare models side-by-side:** Benchmark Gemini against other models to understand relative strengths and weaknesses.
- **Analyze prompt templates:** Evaluate the effectiveness of different prompt designs for optimizing Gemini's performance.

This native integration simplifies the evaluation process, allowing you to focus on understanding and improving the capabilities of Gemini.

#### Understand the `EvalTask` class

The `EvalTask` class is a core component of the *Gen AI Evaluation Service SDK* framework. It allows you to define and run evaluation jobs against your Gen AI models/applications, providing a structured way to measure their performance on specific tasks. Think of an `EvalTask` as a blueprint for your evaluation process.

`EvalTask` class requires an evaluation dataset and a list of metrics. Supported metrics are documented on the Generative AI on Vertex AI [Define your evaluation metrics](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/models/determine-eval) page. The dataset can be an `pandas.DataFrame`, Python dictionary or a file path URI and can contain default column names such as `prompt`, `reference`, `response`, and `baseline_model_response`. 

* **Bring-your-own-response (BYOR):** You already have the data that you want to evaluate stored in the dataset. You can customize the response column names for both your model and the baseline model using parameters like `response_column_name` and `baseline_model_response_column_name` or through the `metric_column_mapping`.

* **Perform model inference without a prompt template:** You have a dataset containing the input prompts to the model and want to perform model inference before evaluation. A column named `prompt` is required in the evaluation dataset and is used directly as input to the model.

* **Perform model inference with a prompt template:** You have a dataset containing the input variables to the prompt template and want to assemble the prompts for model inference. Evaluation dataset must contain column names corresponding to the variable names in the prompt template. For example, if prompt template is "Instruction: {instruction}, context: {context}", the dataset must contain `instruction` and `context` columns.



`EvalTask` supports extensive evaluation scenarios including BYOR, model inference with Gemini models, 3P models endpoints/SDK clients, or custom model generation functions, using computation-based metrics, model-based pointwise and pairwise metrics. The `evaluate()` method triggers the evaluation process, optionally taking a model, prompt template, experiment logging configuartions, and other evaluation run configurations. You can view the SDK reference documentation for [Gen AI Evaluation package](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/reference/python/latest/vertexai.evaluation) for more details.

### Define a model


```
# Model to be evaluated
model = GenerativeModel(
    "gemini-1.5-pro",
    generation_config={"temperature": 0.6, "max_output_tokens": 256, "top_k": 1},
)
```

### Use computation-based metrics



```
# Define an EvalTask with ROUGE-L-SUM metric
rouge_eval_task = EvalTask(
    dataset=dataset,
    metrics=["rouge_l_sum"],
)
rouge_result = rouge_eval_task.evaluate(
    model=model,
    prompt_template="# System_prompt\n{system_prompt} # Question\n{question}",
)
```


```
display_eval_result(rouge_result)
```

### Use model-based pointwise metrics

#### Select a pointwise metric to use


```
supported_example_metric_names = (
    MetricPromptTemplateExamples.list_example_metric_names()
)

for metric in supported_example_metric_names:
    print(metric)
```


```
import ipywidgets as widgets

pointwise_single_turn_metrics = [
    metric
    for metric in supported_example_metric_names
    if not metric.startswith("pairwise") and not metric.startswith("multi_turn")
]

dropdown = widgets.Dropdown(
    options=pointwise_single_turn_metrics,
    description="Select a metric:",
    font_weight="bold",
    style={"description_width": "initial"},
)


def dropdown_eventhandler(change):
    global POINTWISE_METRIC
    if change["type"] == "change" and change["name"] == "value":
        POINTWISE_METRIC = change.new
        print("Selected:", change.new)


POINTWISE_METRIC = dropdown.value
dropdown.observe(dropdown_eventhandler, names="value")
display(dropdown)
```


```
# Define an EvalTask with a pointwise model-based metric
pointwise_eval_task = EvalTask(
    dataset=dataset,
    metrics=[POINTWISE_METRIC],
)

pointwise_result = pointwise_eval_task.evaluate(
    model=model,
    prompt_template="# System_prompt\n{system_prompt} # Question\n{question}",
)
```


```
display_eval_result(pointwise_result)
```


```
display_explanations(pointwise_result, metrics=[POINTWISE_METRIC], n=1)
```

#### Build your own pointwise metric

For more inforamation about metric customization, see this [notebook tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/github/GoogleCloudPlatform/generative-ai/blob/main/gemini/evaluation/customize_model_based_metrics.ipynb).


```
# Create a unique model-based metric for your own use cases
linguistic_acceptability = PointwiseMetric(
    metric="linguistic_acceptability",
    metric_prompt_template=PointwiseMetricPromptTemplate(
        criteria={
            "Proper Grammar": "The language's grammar rules are correctly followed, including but not limited to sentence structures, verb tenses, subject-verb agreement, proper punctuation, and capitalization.",
            "Appropriate word choice": "Words chosen are appropriate and purposeful given their relative context and positioning in the text. Vocabulary demonstrates prompt understanding.",
            "Reference Alignment": "The response is consistent and aligned with the reference.",
        },
        rating_rubric={
            "5": "Excellent: The writing is grammatically correct, uses appropriate vocabulary and aligns perfectly with the reference.",
            "4": "Good: The writing is generally grammatically correct, uses appropriate vocabulary and aligns well with the reference.",
            "3": "Satisfactory: The writing may have minor grammatical errors or use less-appropriate vocabulary, but it aligns reasonably well with the reference.",
            "2": "Unsatisfactory: The writing has significant grammatical errors, uses inappropriate vocabulary, deviates significantly from the reference.",
            "1": "Poor: The writing is riddled with grammatical errors, uses highly inappropriate vocabulary, is completely unrelated to the reference.",
        },
        input_variables=["prompt", "reference"],
    ),
)
```


```
pointwise_eval_task = EvalTask(
    dataset=dataset,
    metrics=[linguistic_acceptability],
)

pointwise_result = pointwise_eval_task.evaluate(
    model=model,
    prompt_template="# System_prompt\n{system_prompt} # Question\n{question}",
)
```


```
display_eval_result(pointwise_result)
```

### Use model-based pairwise metrics

Evaluate two Gen AI models side-by-side (SxS) with model-based pairwise metrics.

#### Select a pairwise metric to use


```
from IPython.display import display
import ipywidgets as widgets

pairwise_single_turn_metrics = [
    metric
    for metric in supported_example_metric_names
    if metric.startswith("pairwise") and "multi_turn" not in metric
]

dropdown = widgets.Dropdown(
    options=pairwise_single_turn_metrics,
    description="Select a metric:",
    font_weight="bold",
    style={"description_width": "initial"},
)


def dropdown_eventhandler(change):
    global pairwise_metric_name
    if change["type"] == "change" and change["name"] == "value":
        pairwise_metric = change.new
        print("Selected:", change.new)


pairwise_metric_name = dropdown.value
dropdown.observe(dropdown_eventhandler, names="value")
display(dropdown)
```

#### Define a baseline model to compare against


```
# Define a baseline model for pairwise comparison
baseline_model = GenerativeModel("gemini-1.5-flash-001")
```

#### Run SxS evaluation


```
# Create a pairwise metric
PAIRWISE_METRIC = PairwiseMetric(
    metric=pairwise_metric_name,
    metric_prompt_template=MetricPromptTemplateExamples.get_prompt_template(
        pairwise_metric_name
    ),
    baseline_model=baseline_model,
)
```


```
pairwise_eval_task = EvalTask(
    dataset=dataset,
    metrics=[PAIRWISE_METRIC],
)
# Specify a candidate model for pairwise comparison
pairwise_result = pairwise_eval_task.evaluate(
    model=model,
    prompt_template="# System_prompt\n{system_prompt} # Question\n{question}",
)
```


```
display_eval_result(
    pairwise_result,
    title="Gemini-1.5-Flash vs. Gemini-1.5-Pro SxS Pairwise Evaluation Results",
)
```

## Run evaluation on 3P Models

The *Vertex Gen AI Evaluation Service SDK* provides robust support for evaluating third-party (3P) models, allowing you to assess and compare models from various sources. The *Gen AI Evaluation Service SDK* allows you to provide a generic Python function as input to specify how the model/application should be invoked for batch inference, which could be done through an endpoint or an SDK. This flexible approach accommodates a wide range of open and closed models.

**Open Models:**

Evaluate open models like a pre-trained `Llama 3.1` or a fine-tuned `Llama 3` models deployed with Vertex AI Model Garden using the *Gen AI Evaluation Service SDK*. This enables you to assess the performance of these models and understand how they align with your specific requirements.

**Closed Models:**

Evaluate the performance of closed model APIs, such as Anthropic's `Claude 3.5 Sonnet`, hosted on Vertex AI. This allows you to compare the capabilities of different closed models and make informed decisions about which best suits your needs.


```
# Define an EvalTask with a list of metrics
pointwise_eval_task = EvalTask(
    dataset=dataset,
    metrics=[
        "coherence",
        "fluency",
        "instruction_following",
        "text_quality",
        "rouge_l_sum",
    ],
)
```

### Run Evaluation on Llama 3.1 API Endpoint

You can experiment with various supported Llama models.

This tutorial use Llama 3 8B Instruct, 70B Instruct, and 405B Instruct using Model-as-a-Service (MaaS). Using Model-as-a-Service (MaaS), you can access Llama 3.1 models in just a few clicks without any setup or infrastructure hassles. Model-as-a-Service (MaaS) integrates [Llama Guard](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-Guard-3-8B) as a safety filter. It is switched on by default and can be switched off. Llama Guard enables us to safeguard model inputs and outputs. If a response is filtered, it will be populated with a `finish_reason` field (with value `content_filtered`) and a `refusal` field (stating the filtering reason).

You can also access Llama models for self-service in Vertex AI Model Garden, allowing you to choose your preferred infrastructure. [Check out Llama 3.1 model card](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/publishers/meta/model-garden/llama3_1?_ga=2.31261500.2048242469.1721714335-1107467625.1721655511) to learn how to deploy a Llama 3.1 models on Vertex AI.


```
MODEL_ID = "meta/llama3-8b-instruct-maas"  # @param {type:"string"} ["meta/llama3-8b-instruct-maas", "meta/llama3-70b-instruct-maas", "meta/llama3-405b-instruct-maas"]
```

#### Authentication

You can request an access token from the default credentials for the current environment. Note that the access token lives for [1 hour by default](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/token-types#at-lifetime); after expiration, it must be refreshed.



```
credentials, _ = default()
auth_request = transport.requests.Request()
credentials.refresh(auth_request)
```

Then configure the OpenAI SDK to point to the Llama 3.1 API endpoint.

Note: only `us-central1` is supported region for Llama 3.1 models using Model-as-a-Service (MaaS).


```
MODEL_LOCATION = "us-central1"

client = openai.OpenAI(
    base_url=f"https://{MODEL_LOCATION}-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1beta1/projects/{PROJECT_ID}/locations/{MODEL_LOCATION}/endpoints/openapi/chat/completions?",
    api_key=credentials.token,
)
```

#### Set model configurations for Llama 3.1

Use the following parameters to generate different answers:

*   `temperature` to control the randomness of the response
*   `max_tokens` to limit the response length
*   `top_p` to control the quality of the response


```
temperature = 1.0  # @param {type:"number"}
max_tokens = 50  # @param {type:"integer"}
top_p = 1.0  # @param {type:"number"}
apply_llama_guard = True  # @param {type:"boolean"}

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=MODEL_ID,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Llama 3.1!"}],
    extra_body={
        "extra_body": {

            }
        }
    },
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)

## Prompt Engineering

The *Vertex AI Gen AI Evaluation Service SDK* simplifies prompt engineering by streamlining the process of creating and evaluating multiple prompt templates. It allows you to efficiently test different prompts against a chosen dataset and compare their performance using comprehensive evaluation metrics. This empowers you to identify the most effective prompts for your specific use case and optimize your generative AI applications.

### Design a prompt with Prompt Template


```
system_instruction = "You are a poetic assistant, skilled in explaining complex concepts with creative flair."
question = "How does LLM work?"
requirements = "Explain concepts in great depth using simple terms, and give examples to help people learn. At the end of each explanation, you ask a question to check for understanding"

prompt_template = f"{system_instruction} Answer this question: {question}, and follow the requirements: {requirements}."


model_response = (
    GenerativeModel("gemini-1.5-pro")
    .generate_content(prompt_template)
    .candidates[0]
    .content.parts[0]
    .text
)


display(HTML(f"<h2>Assembled Prompt:</h2><hr><h3>{prompt_template}</h3>"))
display(HTML("<h2>Model Response: </h2><hr>"))
Markdown(model_response)
```

###  Compare and optimize prompt template design

#### Define an evaluation dataset


To perform pointwise inference, the evaluation dataset is required to contain the following fields:

* Instruction: Part of the input user prompt. It refers to the inference instruction that is sent to your LLM.
* Context: User input for the Gen AI model or application in the current turn.
* Reference: The ground truth to compare your LLM response to.

Your dataset must include a minimum of one evaluation example. We recommend around 100 examples to ensure high-quality aggregated metrics and statistically significant results.


```
instruction = "Summarize the following article: \n"

context = [
    "Typhoon Phanfone has killed at least one person, a US airman on Okinawa who was washed away by high waves. Thousands of households have lost power and Japan's two largest airlines have suspended many flights. The storm also forced the suspension of the search for people missing after last week's volcanic eruption. The storm-tracking website Tropical Storm Risk forecasts that Phanfone will rapidly lose power over the next few hours as it goes further into the Pacific Ocean. Typhoon Phanfone was downgraded from an earlier status of a super typhoon, but the Japan Meteorological Agency had warned it was still a dangerous storm. Japan averages 11 typhoons a year, according to its weather agency. The typhoon made landfall on Monday morning near the central city of Hamamatsu, with winds of up to 180 km/h (112 mph). The airman was one of three US military personnel swept away by high waves whipped up by the typhoon off southern Okinawa island, where the US has a large military base. The remaining two are still missing. A police spokesman said they had been taking photographs of the sea. A university student who was surfing off the seas of Kanagawa Prefecture, south of Tokyo, was also missing, national broadcast NHK reports. It said at least 10 people had been injured and 9,500 houses were without power. The storm was expected to deposit about 100mm of rain on Tokyo over 24 hours, according to the Transport Ministry website. Many schools were closed on Monday and two car companies in Japan halted production at some plants ahead of the storm. More than 174 domestic flights were affected nationwide, NHK state broadcaster said on Sunday. On Sunday, heavy rain delayed the Japanese Formula One Grand Prix in Suzaka. French driver Jules Bianchi lost control in the wet conditions and crashed, sustaining a severe head injury.",
    "The blaze started at the detached building in Drivers End in Codicote, near Welwyn, during the morning. There was another fire at the building 20 years ago, after which fire-proof foil was placed under the thatch, which is protecting the main building. More than 15 fire engines and support vehicles were called to tackle the blaze. Roads in the area were closed and traffic diverted.",
    'The 18-year-old fell at the New Charter Academy on Broadoak Road in Ashton-under-Lyne at about 09:10 BST, Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said. GMP said he had gone to Manchester Royal Infirmary and his condition was "serious". Principal Jenny Langley said the school would remain "fully open" while police investigated. "Our thoughts are with the family and we\'re doing everything we can to support them along with staff and pupils," she said.',
    'But Belgian-born Dutchman Max Verstappen was unable to drive a car legally on his own in either country. That all changed on Wednesday when the youngster turned 18 and passed his driving test at the first attempt. Despite having competed in 14 grands prix since his debut in Australia in March, Verstappen admitted to feeling the pressure during his test. "It\'s a relief," said the Toro Rosso driver, who finished ninth in Japan on Sunday and had only started driving lessons a week ago. "I was a bit nervous to make mistakes, but the exam went well." A bonus of turning 18 is that Verstappen will now be able to drink the champagne if he ever makes it onto the podium.',

## Overview

This notebook shows how to use Vertex AI Python SDK for Gen AI Evaluation Service for evaluating multimodal task with your locally-defined `CustomMetric`, and use your own autorater model to perform model-based metric evaluation.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning">
<b>⚠️ This notebook shows an experiment approach to evaluate multimodal task using Vertex AI Python SDK for Gen AI Evaluation Service. The result of the evaluation depends on the autorater's capabilities of handling multimodal inputs with evaluation criteria. ⚠️</b>
</div>

## Getting Started

### Install Vertex AI SDK for Gen AI Evaluation Service


```
%pip install -U -q google-cloud-aiplatform[evaluation]
```

### Restart runtime

To use the newly installed packages in this Jupyter runtime, you must restart the runtime. You can do this by running the cell below, which restarts the current kernel.

The restart might take a minute or longer. After it's restarted, continue to the next step.


```
import IPython

app = IPython.Application.instance()
app.kernel.do_shutdown(True)
```

<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning">
<b>⚠️ The kernel is going to restart. Wait until it's finished before continuing to the next step. ⚠️</b>
</div>


### Authenticate your notebook environment (Colab only)

If you're running this notebook on Google Colab, run the cell below to authenticate your environment.


```
import sys

if "google.colab" in sys.modules:
    from google.colab import auth

    auth.authenticate_user()
```

### Set Google Cloud project information and initialize Vertex AI SDK

To get started using Vertex AI, you must have an existing Google Cloud project and [enable the Vertex AI API](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=aiplatform.googleapis.com).

Learn more about [setting up a project and a development environment](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/start/cloud-environment).


```
# Use the environment variable if the user doesn't provide Project ID.
import os

import vertexai

PROJECT_ID = "[your-project-id]"  # @param {type: "string", placeholder: "[your-project-id]", isTemplate: true}

if not PROJECT_ID or PROJECT_ID == "[your-project-id]":
    PROJECT_ID = str(os.environ.get("GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT"))

LOCATION = os.environ.get("GOOGLE_CLOUD_REGION", "us-central1")

vertexai.init(project=PROJECT_ID, location=LOCATION)
```

## Evaluate your multimodal use case with custom metric

Imagine you have a customer insurance app which provides several services including live incident support using an LLM. Given a conversation about a car accident and an image of the damaged car, you want to evaluate the coherence of the generated responses.

### Load your evaluation dataset

Depending on your task and metrics you are planning to calculate, you need to collect your evaluation dataset.

In this scenario, you have a `context` column which contains both the conversation and the location of the image for a specific car accident scenario.

You will be provided with a conversation about a car accident and an image of the damaged car.
Your task is to analyze the image and identify the primary type of damage visible.
Use the conversation for context, but prioritize the visual evidence from the image.

Categorize the primary damage as one of the following:

* bumper
* engine_compartment
* hood
* lateral
* windshield

If the image is unclear or the damage is not visible, respond with "Unable to determine damage type from the provided image."
If the primary damage is something other than the listed categories, respond with "Damage type not listed in available categories."

Conversation:
{conversation}

Image:
{image_of_car_accident}

    response = autorater.generate_content(metric_prompt)

    response_json = {}

            and len(candidate.content.parts) > 0
        ):
            part = candidate.content.parts[0]
            if part.text:
                response_json = json.loads(part.text)

    return response_json
```

### Build your custom metric

To evaluate a multimodal task, you define a custom metric which takes any multimodal content (image, pdf, video and more) and returns a score and an explanation according to some criteria,  rating rubric, and evaluation steps using the defined autorater.

In this scenario, you provide define a coherence metric in this car accident assessment scenario.


```
def custom_coherence_fn(instance):

    conversation = instance["context"]["conversation"]
    image_of_car_accident = instance["context"]["image_of_car_accident"]
    response = instance["response"]

  # Instruction
  You are an insurance agent specializing in evaluating car accident assessments.
  You will be provided with a conversation about a car accident and an image of the damaged car.
  You should first read the conversation and look at the image carefully, and then evaluate the coherence of the generated responses based on the Criteria provided in the Evaluation section below.
  You will assign the response a rating following the Rating Rubric and Evaluation Steps. Give step-by-step explanations for your rating, and only choose ratings from the Rating Rubric.

  # Evaluation
  ## Metric Definition
  You will be assessing coherence, which measures the ability to provide a coherent response based on the conversation and car accident image.

  ## Criteria
  Coherence: It is the quality of being logical and consistent.
  In the context of conversation, it refers to the way that ideas and information are presented in a way that is easy to understand and follow.
  A coherent conversation will have a clear flow and will not jump around from topic to topic.
  The user will also use language that is appropriate for the audience and will avoid making claims that are not supported by evidence.

  ## Rating Rubric
  5: (Perfectly Aligned) The image precisely matches the damage described in the conversation, and the response accurately reflects the damaged car part.
  4: (Highly Aligned) The image generally supports the conversation's description of the damage, and the response is a suitable representation of the affected area.
  3: (Moderately Aligned) The image shows damage that is plausibly related to the accident described, but there might be minor inconsistencies, and the response is broadly relevant but not entirely specific.
  2: (Poorly Aligned)  The image and/or the response have significant inconsistencies with the described accident in the conversation, raising doubts about the claim's validity.
  1: (Misaligned) The image, response, and conversation have major contradictions or  are completely unrelated, making the claim appear illogical or fraudulent.

  ## Evaluation Steps
  STEP 1:  Assess Claim Consistency:  Carefully read the conversation to understand the user's description of the accident and the claimed damage.
  STEP 2:  Analyze Image Relevance: Examine the image to determine if the depicted damage aligns with the user's account. Pay attention to the location and type of damage.
  STEP 3: Evaluate Label Accuracy:  Check if the generated label correctly identifies the damaged car part as described in the conversation and shown in the image.
  STEP 4:  Identify Inconsistencies: Look for any discrepancies between the conversation, image, and label. For example, does the image show damage not mentioned in the conversation, or is the label incorrect for the damaged part?
  STEP 5:  Determine Overall Coherence: Based on the previous steps, assign a coherence score using the 1-5 rubric.  Consider the severity of any inconsistencies and their potential impact on the claim's validity.

### Run Evaluation

With the autorater, and the custom metric, you run your evaluation.


```
metrics = ["exact_match", custom_coherence_metric]

experiment_name = "eval-multimodal-metric"

eval_task = EvalTask(
    dataset=eval_dataset,
    metrics=metrics,
    experiment=experiment_name,
)
```


```
eval_result = eval_task.evaluate()
```

### Visualize and validate your evaluation results.

Using some helpers, you can both evaluation results (scores, and explanations).


```
display_eval_result(eval_result, title="Evaluation Results")
```


```
display_explanations(eval_result, metrics=["custom_coherence"])
```

## Cleaning up


```
delete_experiment = True

if delete_experiment:

    from google.cloud import aiplatform

    aiplatform.init(project=PROJECT_ID, location=LOCATION)
    experiment = aiplatform.Experiment(experiment_name)
    experiment.delete()

The Gemini API has adjustable safety settings. This notebook walks you through how to use them. You'll write a prompt that's blocked, see the reason why, and then adjust the filters to unblock it.

Safety is an important topic, and you can learn more with the links at the end of this notebook. Here, you will focus on the code.


```
!pip install -q -U "google-generativeai>=0.7.2" # Install the Python SDK
```

## Import the Gemini python SDK

Once the kernel is restarted, you can import the Gemini SDK:


```
import google.generativeai as genai
```

## Set up your API key

To run the following cell, your API key must be stored it in a Colab Secret named `GOOGLE_API_KEY`. If you don't already have an API key, or you're not sure how to create a Colab Secret, see the [Authentication](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Authentication.ipynb) quickstart for an example.


```
from google.colab import userdata
GOOGLE_API_KEY=userdata.get('GOOGLE_API_KEY')
genai.configure(api_key=GOOGLE_API_KEY)
```

## Send your prompt request to Gemini

Pick the prompt you want to use to test the safety filters settings. An examples could be `Write a list of 5 very rude things that I might say to the universe after stubbing my toe in the dark` which was previously tested and trigger the `HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT` and `HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT` categories.

The result returned by the [Model.generate_content](https://ai.google.dev/api/python/google/generativeai/GenerativeModel#generate_content) method is a [genai.protos.GenerateContentResponse](https://ai.google.dev/api/python/google/generativeai/types/GenerateContentResponse).


```
model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash')

unsafe_prompt = "I support Martians Soccer Club and I think Jupiterians Football Club sucks! Write a ironic phrase about them."
response = model.generate_content(unsafe_prompt)
```

This response object gives you safety feedback about the candidate answers Gemini generates to you.

For each candidate answer you need to check `response.candidates.finish_reason`.

As you can find on the [Gemini API safety filters documentation](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/safety-settings#safety-feedback):
- if the `candidate.finish_reason` is `FinishReason.STOP` means that your generation request ran successfully
- if the `candidate.finish_reason` is `FinishReason.SAFETY` means that your generation request was blocked by safety reasons. It also means that the `response.text` structure will be empty.


```
print(response.candidates[0].finish_reason)
```

    FinishReason.SAFETY
    

If the `finish_reason` is `FinishReason.SAFETY` you can check which filter caused the block checking the `safety_ratings` list for the candidate answer:


```
print(response.candidates[0].safety_ratings)
```

    [category: HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT
    probability: NEGLIGIBLE
    , category: HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH
    probability: LOW
    , category: HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT
    probability: MEDIUM
    , category: HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT
    probability: NEGLIGIBLE
    ]
    

As the request was blocked by the safety filters, the `response.text` field will be empty (as nothing as generated by the model):


```
try:
    print(response.text)
except:
    print("No information generated by the model.")
```

    No information generated by the model.
    

## Customizing safety settings

Depending on the scenario you are working with, it may be necessary to customize the safety filters behaviors to allow a certain degree of unsafety results.

To make this customization you must define a `safety_settings` dictionary as part of your `model.generate_content()` request. In the example below, all the filters are being set to do not block contents.

**Important:** To guarantee the Google commitment with the Responsible AI development and its [AI Principles](https://ai.google/responsibility/principles/), for some prompts Gemini will avoid generating the results even if you set all the filters to none.


```
response = model.generate_content(
    unsafe_prompt,
    safety_settings={
        'HATE': 'BLOCK_NONE',
        'HARASSMENT': 'BLOCK_NONE',
        'SEXUAL' : 'BLOCK_NONE',
        'DANGEROUS' : 'BLOCK_NONE'
    })
```

Checking again the `candidate.finish_reason` information, if the request was not too unsafe, it must show now the value as `FinishReason.STOP` which means that the request was successfully processed by Gemini.


```
print(response.candidates[0].finish_reason)
```

    FinishReason.STOP
    

Since the request was successfully generated, you can check the result on the `response.text`:


```
try:
    print(response.text)
except:
    print("No information generated by the model.")
```

    "Jupiterians Football Club: So good, they're practically out of this world... literally." 
    
    

And if you check the safety filters ratings, as you set all filters to be ignored, no filtering category was trigerred:


```
print(response.candidates[0].safety_ratings)
```

    [category: HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT
    probability: NEGLIGIBLE
    , category: HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH
    probability: MEDIUM
    , category: HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT
    probability: MEDIUM
    , category: HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT
    probability: NEGLIGIBLE
    ]
    

## Learning more

Learn more with these articles on [safety guidance](https://ai.google.dev/docs/safety_guidance) and [safety settings](https://ai.google.dev/docs/safety_setting_gemini).

## Useful API references

There are 4 configurable safety settings for the Gemini API:
* `HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS`
* `HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT`
* `HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT`
* `HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS`

You can refer to the safety settings using either their full name, or the aliases like `DANGEROUS` used in the Python code above.

Safety settings can be set in the [genai.GenerativeModel](https://ai.google.dev/api/python/google/generativeai/GenerativeModel) constructor.

* They can also be passed on each request to [GenerativeModel.generate_content](https://ai.google.dev/api/python/google/generativeai/GenerativeModel#generate_content) or [ChatSession.send_message](https://ai.google.dev/api/python/google/generativeai/ChatSession?hl=en#send_message).

- The [genai.protos.GenerateContentResponse](https://ai.google.dev/api/python/google/generativeai/protos/GenerateContentResponse) returns [SafetyRatings](https://ai.google.dev/api/python/google/generativeai/protos/SafetyRating) for the prompt in the [GenerateContentResponse.prompt_feedback](https://ai.google.dev/api/python/google/generativeai/protos/GenerateContentResponse/PromptFeedback), and for each [Candidate](https://ai.google.dev/api/python/google/generativeai/protos/Candidate) in the `safety_ratings` attribute.

- A [genai.protos.SafetySetting](https://ai.google.dev/api/python/google/generativeai/protos/SafetySetting)  contains: [genai.protos.HarmCategory](https://ai.google.dev/api/python/google/generativeai/protos/HarmCategory) and a [genai.protos.HarmBlockThreshold](https://ai.google.dev/api/python/google/generativeai/types/HarmBlockThreshold)

- A [genai.protos.SafetyRating](https://ai.google.dev/api/python/google/generativeai/protos/SafetyRating) contains a [HarmCategory](https://ai.google.dev/api/python/google/generativeai/protos/HarmCategory) and a [HarmProbability](https://ai.google.dev/api/python/google/generativeai/types/HarmProbability)

The [genai.protos.HarmCategory](https://ai.google.dev/api/python/google/generativeai/protos/HarmCategory) enum includes both the categories for PaLM and Gemini models.

- When specifying enum values the SDK will accept the enum values themselves, or their integer or string representations.

- The SDK will also accept abbreviated string representations: `["HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT", "DANGEROUS_CONTENT", "DANGEROUS"]` are all valid. Strings are case insensitive.

The Gemini API has adjustable safety settings. This notebook walks you through how to use them. You'll write a prompt that's blocked, see the reason why, and then adjust the filters to unblock it.

Safety is an important topic, and you can learn more with the links at the end of this notebook. For now just focus on the code.

## Set up your API key

If you want to quickly try out the Gemini API, you can use `curl` commands to call the methods in the REST API.

This notebook contains `curl` commands you can run in Google Colab, or copy to your terminal.

To run this notebook, your API key must be stored it in a Colab Secret named GOOGLE_API_KEY. If you are running in a different environment, you can store your key in an environment variable. See [Authentication](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Authentication.ipynb) to learn more.


```
!apt install jq
```


```
import os
from google.colab import userdata
```


```
os.environ['GOOGLE_API_KEY'] = userdata.get('GOOGLE_API_KEY')
```


```
os.environ['UNSAFE_PROMPT'] = 
```

## Prompt Feedback

The result returned by the [Model.generate_content](https://ai.google.dev/api/python/google/generativeai/GenerativeModel#generate_content) method is a [genai.GenerateContentResponse](https://ai.google.dev/api/python/google/generativeai/types/GenerateContentResponse).


```bash
%%bash
echo '{
      "contents": [{
        "parts":[{
          "text": "'$UNSAFE_PROMPT'"}]}]}' > request.json
```


```bash
%%bash

curl "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-pro:generateContent?key=$GOOGLE_API_KEY" \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -X POST \
    -d @request.json  2> /dev/null | tee response.json
```

    {
      "promptFeedback": {
        "blockReason": "SAFETY",
        "safetyRatings": [
          {
            "category": "HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT",
            "probability": "NEGLIGIBLE"
          },
          {
            "category": "HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH",
            "probability": "NEGLIGIBLE"
          },
          {
            "category": "HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT",
            "probability": "MEDIUM"
          },
          {
            "category": "HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT",
            "probability": "NEGLIGIBLE"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    

Above you can see that the response object gives you safety feedback about the prompt in two ways:

* The `prompt_feedback.safety_ratings` attribute contains a list of safety ratings for the input prompt.
* If your prompt is blocked, `prompt_feedback.block_reason` field will explain why.

If the prompt is blocked because of the safety ratings, you will not get any candidates in the response.

### Safety settings

Adjust the safety settings and the prompt is no longer blocked:


```bash
%%bash
echo '{
    "safetySettings": [
        {'category': 7, 'threshold': 4}
    ],
    "contents": [{
        "parts":[{
          "text": "'$UNSAFE_PROMPT'"}]}]}' > request.json
```


```bash
%%bash

curl "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-pro:generateContent?key=$GOOGLE_API_KEY" \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -X POST \
    -d @request.json  2> /dev/null > response.json
```

With the new settings, the `blocked_reason` is no longer set.


```bash
%%bash 

jq .promptFeedback < response.json
```

    {
      "safetyRatings": [
        {
          "category": "HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT",
          "probability": "NEGLIGIBLE"
        },
        {
          "category": "HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH",
          "probability": "NEGLIGIBLE"
        },
        {
          "category": "HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT",
          "probability": "MEDIUM"
        },
        {
          "category": "HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT",
          "probability": "NEGLIGIBLE"
        }
      ]
    }
    

And a candidate response is returned.


```bash
%%bash 

jq .candidates[0].content.parts[].text < response.json
```

You can check `response.text` for the response.

### Candidate ratings

For a prompt that is not blocked, the response object contains a list of `candidate` objects (just 1 for now). Each candidate includes a `finish_reason`:


```bash
%%bash
jq .candidates[0].finishReason < response.json
```

    "STOP"
    

`FinishReason.STOP` means that the model finished its output normally.

`FinishReason.SAFETY` means the candidate's `safety_ratings` exceeded the request's `safety_settings` threshold.


```bash
%%bash
jq .candidates[0].safetyRatings < response.json
```

    [
      {
        "category": "HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT",
        "probability": "NEGLIGIBLE"
      },
      {
        "category": "HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH",
        "probability": "NEGLIGIBLE"
      },
      {
        "category": "HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT",
        "probability": "NEGLIGIBLE"
      },
      {
        "category": "HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT",
        "probability": "NEGLIGIBLE"
      }
    ]

Let's load the `SageMaker Endpoints Embeddings` class. The class can be used if you host, e.g. your own Hugging Face model on SageMaker.

For instructions on how to do this, please see [here](https://www.philschmid.de/custom-inference-huggingface-sagemaker). 

**Note**: In order to handle batched requests, you will need to adjust the return line in the `predict_fn()` function within the custom `inference.py` script:

Change from

`return {"vectors": sentence_embeddings[0].tolist()}`

to:

`return {"vectors": sentence_embeddings.tolist()}`.

# SageMakerEndpoint

[Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) is a system that can build, train, and deploy machine learning (ML) models for any use case with fully managed infrastructure, tools, and workflows.

This notebooks goes over how to use an LLM hosted on a `SageMaker endpoint`.


```python
!pip3 install langchain boto3
```

## Set up

You have to set up following required parameters of the `SagemakerEndpoint` call:
- `endpoint_name`: The name of the endpoint from the deployed Sagemaker model.
    Must be unique within an AWS Region.
- `credentials_profile_name`: The name of the profile in the ~/.aws/credentials or ~/.aws/config files, which
    has either access keys or role information specified.
    If not specified, the default credential profile or, if on an EC2 instance,
    credentials from IMDS will be used.
    See: https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/credentials.html

## Example


```python
from langchain_core.documents import Document
```


```python
example_doc_1 = """
Peter and Elizabeth took a taxi to attend the night party in the city. While in the party, Elizabeth collapsed and was rushed to the hospital.
Since she was diagnosed with a brain injury, the doctor told Peter to stay besides her until she gets well.
Therefore, Peter stayed with her at the hospital for 3 days without leaving.

# SageMaker Tracking

>[Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) is a fully managed service that is used to quickly and easily build, train and deploy machine learning (ML) models. 

>[Amazon SageMaker Experiments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/experiments.html) is a capability of `Amazon SageMaker` that lets you organize, track, compare and evaluate ML experiments and model versions.

This notebook shows how LangChain Callback can be used to log and track prompts and other LLM hyperparameters into `SageMaker Experiments`. Here, we use different scenarios to showcase the capability:

* **Scenario 1**: *Single LLM* - A case where a single LLM model is used to generate output based on a given prompt.
* **Scenario 2**: *Sequential Chain* - A case where a sequential chain of two LLM models is used.
* **Scenario 3**: *Agent with Tools (Chain of Thought)* - A case where multiple tools (search and math) are used in addition to an LLM.


In this notebook, we will create a single experiment to log the prompts from each scenario.

## Installation and Setup


```python
%pip install --upgrade --quiet  sagemaker
%pip install --upgrade --quiet  langchain-openai
%pip install --upgrade --quiet  google-search-results
```

First, setup the required API keys

* OpenAI: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys (For OpenAI LLM model)
* Google SERP API: https://serpapi.com/manage-api-key (For Google Search Tool)


```python
import os

## Add your API keys below
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "<ADD-KEY-HERE>"
os.environ["SERPAPI_API_KEY"] = "<ADD-KEY-HERE>"
```


```python
from langchain_community.callbacks.sagemaker_callback import SageMakerCallbackHandler
```


```python
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent, load_tools
from langchain.chains import LLMChain, SimpleSequentialChain
from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain_openai import OpenAI
from sagemaker.analytics import ExperimentAnalytics
from sagemaker.experiments.run import Run
from sagemaker.session import Session
```

## LLM Prompt Tracking


```python
# LLM Hyperparameters
HPARAMS = {
    "temperature": 0.1,
    "model_name": "gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct",
}

# Bucket used to save prompt logs (Use `None` is used to save the default bucket or otherwise change it)
BUCKET_NAME = None

# Experiment name
EXPERIMENT_NAME = "langchain-sagemaker-tracker"

# Create SageMaker Session with the given bucket
session = Session(default_bucket=BUCKET_NAME)
```

### Scenario 1 - LLM


```python
RUN_NAME = "run-scenario-1"
PROMPT_TEMPLATE = "tell me a joke about {topic}"
INPUT_VARIABLES = {"topic": "fish"}
```


```python
with Run(
    experiment_name=EXPERIMENT_NAME, run_name=RUN_NAME, sagemaker_session=session
) as run:
    # Create SageMaker Callback
    sagemaker_callback = SageMakerCallbackHandler(run)

    # Define LLM model with callback
    llm = OpenAI(callbacks=[sagemaker_callback], **HPARAMS)

    # Create prompt template
    prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(template=PROMPT_TEMPLATE)

    # Create LLM Chain
    chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt, callbacks=[sagemaker_callback])

    # Run chain
    chain.run(**INPUT_VARIABLES)

    # Reset the callback
    sagemaker_callback.flush_tracker()
```

### Scenario 2 - Sequential Chain


```python
RUN_NAME = "run-scenario-2"

PROMPT_TEMPLATE_1 = """You are a playwright. Given the title of play, it is your job to write a synopsis for that title.
Title: {title}
Playwright: This is a synopsis for the above play:"""
PROMPT_TEMPLATE_2 = """You are a play critic from the New York Times. Given the synopsis of play, it is your job to write a review for that play.
Play Synopsis: {synopsis}
Review from a New York Times play critic of the above play:"""

INPUT_VARIABLES = {
    "input": "documentary about good video games that push the boundary of game design"
}
```


```python
with Run(
    experiment_name=EXPERIMENT_NAME, run_name=RUN_NAME, sagemaker_session=session
) as run:
    # Create SageMaker Callback
    sagemaker_callback = SageMakerCallbackHandler(run)

    # Create prompt templates for the chain
    prompt_template1 = PromptTemplate.from_template(template=PROMPT_TEMPLATE_1)
    prompt_template2 = PromptTemplate.from_template(template=PROMPT_TEMPLATE_2)

    # Define LLM model with callback
    llm = OpenAI(callbacks=[sagemaker_callback], **HPARAMS)

    # Create chain1
    chain1 = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt_template1, callbacks=[sagemaker_callback])

    # Create chain2
    chain2 = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt_template2, callbacks=[sagemaker_callback])

    # Create Sequential chain
    overall_chain = SimpleSequentialChain(
        chains=[chain1, chain2], callbacks=[sagemaker_callback]
    )

    # Run overall sequential chain
    overall_chain.run(**INPUT_VARIABLES)

    # Reset the callback
    sagemaker_callback.flush_tracker()
```

### Scenario 3 - Agent with Tools


```python
RUN_NAME = "run-scenario-3"
PROMPT_TEMPLATE = "Who is the oldest person alive? And what is their current age raised to the power of 1.51?"
```


```python
with Run(
    experiment_name=EXPERIMENT_NAME, run_name=RUN_NAME, sagemaker_session=session
) as run:
    # Create SageMaker Callback
    sagemaker_callback = SageMakerCallbackHandler(run)

    # Define LLM model with callback
    llm = OpenAI(callbacks=[sagemaker_callback], **HPARAMS)

    # Define tools
    tools = load_tools(["serpapi", "llm-math"], llm=llm, callbacks=[sagemaker_callback])

    # Initialize agent with all the tools
    agent = initialize_agent(
        tools, llm, agent="zero-shot-react-description", callbacks=[sagemaker_callback]
    )

    # Run agent
    agent.run(input=PROMPT_TEMPLATE)

    # Reset the callback
    sagemaker_callback.flush_tracker()
```

## Load Log Data

Once the prompts are logged, we can easily load and convert them to Pandas DataFrame as follows.


```python
# Load
logs = ExperimentAnalytics(experiment_name=EXPERIMENT_NAME)

# Convert as pandas dataframe
df = logs.dataframe(force_refresh=True)

print(df.shape)
df.head()
```

As can be seen above, there are three runs (rows) in the experiment corresponding to each scenario. Each run logs the prompts and related LLM settings/hyperparameters as json and are saved in s3 bucket. Feel free to load and explore the log data from each json path.


```python

```

# Sales Bot with Llama3 - A Summarization and RAG Use Case

## Overview

In this notebook you'll take an Amazon product reviews dataset from Kaggle and use Llama3 to obtain product review summaries, upsert those summaries in a vector database, then use Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to power a sales chatbot that can make targeted product recommendations.

Let's take a look at the overall workflow:
1. We start with a dataset that contains over 10,000 reviews across 900 Amazon musical instruments and accessories.
2. Using Llama2 70B chat (hosted on OctoAI), we generate summaries of product reviews for each product from the 20 most recent reviews. We format the summaries in JSON format.
3. We then take the summaries and upsert them into a vector database (Weaviate in this case)
4. We then use this vector database and Llama3 70B instruct (hosted on OctoAI) to build a RAG-based sales chatbot that provides targeted recommendations to the user based on the products that are present in the inventory.

Note: at the time of writing this tutorial, JSON mode formatting isn't supported for Llama 3 on OctoAI via constrained sampling which is why we are falling back onto Llama 2. This tutorial will be updated when the feature becomes available to rely on Llama 3 exclusively.

### OctoAI
We'll use [OctoAI](https://octo.ai/) to power all of the GenAI model needs of this notebook: LLMs, image gen, image animation.
* To use OctoAI, you'll need to go to https://octoai.cloud/ and sign in using your Google or GitHub account.
* Next you'll need to generate an OctoAI API token by following these [instructions](https://octo.ai/docs/getting-started/how-to-create-an-octoai-access-token). Keep the API token in hand, we'll need it further down in this notebook.

In this example we will use the Llama 3 70b instruct model. You can find more on Llama models on the [OctoAI text generation solution page](https://octoai.cloud/text).

At the time of writing this notebook the following Llama models are available on OctoAI:
* meta-llama-3-8b-instruct
* meta-llama-3-70b-instruct
* codellama-7b-instruct
* codellama-13b-instruct
* codellama-34b-instruct
* llama-2-13b-chat
* llama-2-70b-chat
* llamaguard-7b

### Weaviate
We'll use Weaviate Cloud Services (WCS) for our vector database. You can create an account and Weaviate clusters easily at the following link: https://console.weaviate.cloud/.
You can then create a cluster, from which you can obtain the REST Endpoint URL and the API key to use the cluster endpoint.

### OpenAI
We'll be using OpenAI for its embedding model to upsert our vectors into the Weaviate vector database. Create an account and obtain an API key here: https://openai.com/api/

### Local Python Notebook
We highly recommend launching this notebook from a fresh python environment, for instance you can run the following:
```
python3 -m venv .venv         
source .venv/bin/activate
```
All you need to run this notebook is to install jupyter notebook with `python3 -m pip install notebook` then run `jupyter notebook` ([link](https://jupyter.org/install)) in the same directory as this `.ipynb` file.
You don't need to install additional pip packages ahead of running the notebook, since those will be installed right at the beginning. You will need to ensure your system has `imagemagick` installed by following the [instructions](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php).


```python
# Let's start by installing the appropriate python packages
! pip install octoai===1.0.2 openai weaviate-client pandas gradio pydantic
```

## Part 1: Review Summarization

Let's start by importing all of the packages we need for this example


```python
import gradio
import json
import langchain
import os
import openai
import weaviate
from getpass import getpass
from json import loads
from pandas import DataFrame, concat, read_csv
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import List
import weaviate.classes as wvc
```

Enter your OctoAI, Weaviate, and OpenAI tokens below


```python
# Get OctoAI API token for Llama 2 & 3
OCTOAI_API_TOKEN = getpass()
os.environ["OCTOAI_API_TOKEN"] = OCTOAI_API_TOKEN
```


```python
# Get WCS API key
WCS_API_KEY = getpass()
os.environ["WCS_API_KEY"] = WCS_API_KEY
```


```python
# Get WCS URL
WCS_URL = getpass()
os.environ["WCS_URL"] = WCS_URL
```


```python
# Get OpenAI API key for the embedding model
OPENAI_API_KEY = getpass()
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = OPENAI_API_KEY
```


```python
# First let's load the dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/eswarchandt/amazon-music-reviews
df = read_csv('Musical_instruments_reviews.csv')
```

Set `product_record_limit` to a lower number if you just want to do a test run


```python
# Set a product record limit
product_record_limit = 900
```

# List all of the unique ASIN:
asin_list = df.asin.unique()
print("There are {} unique products in the music product inventory".format(len(asin_list)))

For each one of the unique products, let's group the reviews together and sort them by how recent they are


```python
# Get the reviews for the product ASIN, sorted by recency and store in dict
review_dict = {}
for asin in asin_list[0:product_record_limit]:
    reviews = df.loc[df['asin'] == asin]\
                .sort_values(["unixReviewTime"], axis=0, ascending=False)\
                .reviewText.tolist()
    review_dict[asin] = reviews
```

To be able to store our summaries into our vector DB, we need to have the fields formatted into a JSON object. We use Pydantic base class model here to define our formatting.


```python
# Define the Pydantic model that specifies how our output should be formatted
class ProductRecord(BaseModel):
    """The record of a given product"""
    description: str = Field(description="Description of the product")
    name: str = Field(description="Name of the product")
    review_summary: str = Field(description="Summary of all of the reviews")
    ASIN: str = Field(description="ASIN of the product")
    features: str = Field(description="Features of the product based on the reviews")
```

We define our prompt template below.


```python
# Prepare a prompt template
template = '''
Here are product reviews for a music product with an ID of {asin}.
 - Respond back only as only JSON!
 - Provide:
     - the product "description",
     - the product "name",
     - a summary of all the reviews as "review_summary",
     - the "ASIN" and
     - and the product "features" based on the content of these reviews. 
 - The "features" should be a string describing the features and NOT JSON. 
 - Do not include the ASIN in the description field.
 
The reviews for the product are: {reviews}
'''
```

We initialize the OctoAI client using OpenAI's API. All we have to do is override the `base_url` and `api_key`.


```python
# Init OctoAI client
client = openai.OpenAI(
    base_url="https://text.octoai.run/v1",
    api_key=os.environ["OCTOAI_API_TOKEN"]
)
```

Iterate over all product ASINs and summarize the top 20 most recent reviews. Note: this takes a while to run unless we parallelize it.


```python
# Produce the 900 product summaries
review_summaries = []
counter = 0

# This can take a while to process serially (30min+)
# TODO: Optimize to run in a few parallel threads to run faster while meeting the 240RPM limit
for asin, review_list in review_dict.items():
    print(f'Getting review summary {counter} of {len(review_dict)}, ASIN: {asin}')
    try:
        response = client.chat.completions.create(
            model="llama-2-70b-chat",
            messages=[
                {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
                {"role": "user", "content": template.format(
                    asin = asin,
                    reviews = review_list[0:20]
                )},
            ],
            temperature=0,
            response_format={"type": "json_object", "schema": ProductRecord.model_json_schema()},
            max_tokens=1024
        )
        print("\n{}\n".format(response.choices[0].message.content))
        summary = loads(response.choices[0].message.content)
        summary["ASIN"] = asin
        review_summaries.append(summary)
    except:
        print(f'Issue with ASIN {asin}, skipping')
        pass
    counter += 1

review_summaries = DataFrame(review_summaries)

print(review_summaries)
```

# Part 2: Retrieval Augmented Generation

For our RAG use case we're going to rely on Weaviate vector database and on an OpenAI embedding model. 

When you define your collection, you'll need to provide properties, i.e. object attributes that you want to store in the collection. These properties map 1:1 to the JSON dictionary keys defined earlier for the `ProductRecord` Pydantic base model.


```python
# Connect to WCS
wcs_client = weaviate.connect_to_wcs(
    cluster_url=os.getenv("WCS_URL"),
    auth_credentials=weaviate.auth.AuthApiKey(os.getenv("WCS_API_KEY")),
    headers={
        "X-OpenAI-Api-Key": os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]
    }
)
```


```python
# Create the collection if it doesn't already exist
try:
    collection = wcs_client.collections.get("Products")
except:
    # Create the collection for products
    collection = wcs_client.collections.create(
        name="Products",
        vectorizer_config=wvc.config.Configure.Vectorizer.text2vec_openai(),
        properties=[
            wvc.config.Property(
                name="ASIN",
                data_type=wvc.config.DataType.TEXT
            ),
             wvc.config.Property(
                name="name",
                data_type=wvc.config.DataType.TEXT
            ),
             wvc.config.Property(
                name="review_summary",
                data_type=wvc.config.DataType.TEXT
            ),
             wvc.config.Property(
                name="features",
                data_type=wvc.config.DataType.TEXT
            ),
             wvc.config.Property(
                name="description",
                data_type=wvc.config.DataType.TEXT
            ),
        ]
    )
    print("Collection Created!")
```

Now we upsert all of the vectors into the databse using OpenAI's embedding model.


```python
# Convert df to JSON string and then to a list of dictionaries
data = review_summaries.to_json(orient='records')
data_list = json.loads(data)

items_to_insert = []

for d in data_list:
    new_item = {
        "ASIN": d["ASIN"],
        "name": d["name"],
        "description": d["description"],  \
        "features": d["features"],
        "review_summary": d["review_summary"]
    }
    items_to_insert.append(new_item)

    # Insert every 100 items
    if len(items_to_insert) == 100:
        collection.data.insert_many(items_to_insert)
        items_to_insert.clear()

# Insert remaining items
if len(items_to_insert) > 0:
    collection.data.insert_many(items_to_insert)
```

Let's now try to run a hybrid search on the following query below.
Hybrid search combines the results of a vector search and a keyword (BM25F) search by fusing the two result sets.
It will return the 3 closest entries in the database according to the search criteria.


```python
# Hybrid search
response = collection.query.hybrid(
    query="easy to learn instrument",
    limit=3
)
for o in response.objects:
    print(o.properties)
```

Let's now define a helper function that gives us the relevant context given a string query. Let's see what it returns based on the question: "What is a good beginner harmonica"


```python
# Helper function to run hybrid search on a user query and return the closest
# product review summaries relevant to the user query
def get_context(question, limit=3):
    response = collection.query.hybrid(
        query=question,
        limit=limit
    )
    return "\n".join([str(o.properties) for o in response.objects])

print(get_context("What is a good beginner harmonica"))
```

Great, we're now ready to build a sales assistant helper function.

We first define a prompt template for Llama 3 - based on the context provided by the vector hybrid search (i.e. collection of product summaries of relevance to the question), provide a helpful recommendation to the customer. 

Also provide links to the product that the user can click on to view the product on Amazon's website. For that we use the fact that any product referenced by its aSIN can be accessed at the following url: `https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/<insert aSIN here>`


```python
sales_template = """
You are a sales assistant. Answer the user questions as helpfully as possible.
Only recommend the products that are provided in the context provided below.

Provide a reference to each product you mention with hyperlinks:
* Provide the name of the product
* Embed the hyperlink in the name of the product as follows
    * If the product name is "Solid Electric Guitar Case with Accessories Compartment"
    * And the aSIN is "B001EL6I8W"
    * Format the reference as follows: 
         [Solid Electric Guitar Case with Accessories Compartment](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B001EL6I8W)

Finish with a references section.

Customer question: {}

Product context: {}

AI:
"""

def sales_assistant(question):  
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
                model="meta-llama-3-70b-instruct",
                messages=[
                    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
                    {"role": "user", "content": sales_template.format(question, get_context(question, limit=10))},
                ],
                temperature=0,
                max_tokens=1024
            )
    
    return response.choices[0].message.content

print(sales_assistant("what is must have accessory for my new electric guitar"))
```

# Part 3: Gradio-based sales assistant demo

In this section we build a simple an interactive sales bot assistant using Gradio.


```python
import gradio as gr

# SalesGPT - Context-Aware AI Sales Assistant With Knowledge Base and Ability Generate Stripe Payment Links

This notebook demonstrates an implementation of a **Context-Aware** AI Sales agent with a Product Knowledge Base which can actually close sales. 

This notebook was originally published at [filipmichalsky/SalesGPT](https://github.com/filip-michalsky/SalesGPT) by [@FilipMichalsky](https://twitter.com/FilipMichalsky).

SalesGPT is context-aware, which means it can understand what section of a sales conversation it is in and act accordingly.
 
As such, this agent can have a natural sales conversation with a prospect and behaves based on the conversation stage. Hence, this notebook demonstrates how we can use AI to automate sales development representatives activites, such as outbound sales calls. 

Additionally, the AI Sales agent has access to tools, which allow it to interact with other systems.

Here, we show how the AI Sales Agent can use a **Product Knowledge Base** to speak about a particular's company offerings,
hence increasing relevance and reducing hallucinations.

Furthermore, we show how our AI Sales Agent can **generate sales** by integration with the AI Agent Highway called [Mindware](https://www.mindware.co/). In practice, this allows the agent to autonomously generate a payment link for your customers **to pay for your products via Stripe**.

We leverage the [`langchain`](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) library in this implementation, specifically [Custom Agent Configuration](https://langchain-langchain.vercel.app/docs/modules/agents/how_to/custom_agent_with_tool_retrieval) and are inspired by [BabyAGI](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi) architecture .

### SalesGPT architecture

1. Seed the SalesGPT agent
2. Run Sales Agent to decide what to do:

    a) Use a tool, such as look up Product Information in a Knowledge Base or Generate a Payment Link
    
    b) Output a response to a user 
3. Run Sales Stage Recognition Agent to recognize which stage is the sales agent at and adjust their behaviour accordingly.

Here is the schematic of the architecture:

### Sales conversation stages.

The agent employs an assistant who keeps it in check as in what stage of the conversation it is in. These stages were generated by ChatGPT and can be easily modified to fit other use cases or modes of conversation.

1. Introduction: Start the conversation by introducing yourself and your company. Be polite and respectful while keeping the tone of the conversation professional.

2. Qualification: Qualify the prospect by confirming if they are the right person to talk to regarding your product/service. Ensure that they have the authority to make purchasing decisions.

3. Value proposition: Briefly explain how your product/service can benefit the prospect. Focus on the unique selling points and value proposition of your product/service that sets it apart from competitors.

4. Needs analysis: Ask open-ended questions to uncover the prospect's needs and pain points. Listen carefully to their responses and take notes.

5. Solution presentation: Based on the prospect's needs, present your product/service as the solution that can address their pain points.

6. Objection handling: Address any objections that the prospect may have regarding your product/service. Be prepared to provide evidence or testimonials to support your claims.

7. Close: Ask for the sale by proposing a next step. This could be a demo, a trial or a meeting with decision-makers. Ensure to summarize what has been discussed and reiterate the benefits.



```python

            Now determine what should be the next immediate conversation stage for the agent in the sales conversation by selecting ony from the following options:
            1. Introduction: Start the conversation by introducing yourself and your company. Be polite and respectful while keeping the tone of the conversation professional.
            2. Qualification: Qualify the prospect by confirming if they are the right person to talk to regarding your product/service. Ensure that they have the authority to make purchasing decisions.

            7. Close: Ask for the sale by proposing a next step. This could be a demo, a trial or a meeting with decision-makers. Ensure to summarize what has been discussed and reiterate the benefits.

            Only answer with a number between 1 through 7 with a best guess of what stage should the conversation continue with. 
            The answer needs to be one number only, no words.
            If there is no conversation history, output 1.
            Do not answer anything else nor add anything to you answer."""

### Payment gateway

In order to set up your AI agent to use a payment gateway to generate payment links for your users you need two things:

1. Sign up for a Stripe account and obtain a STRIPE API KEY
2. Create products you would like to sell in the Stripe UI. Then follow out example of `example_product_price_id_mapping.json`
to feed the product name to price_id mapping which allows you to generate the payment links.


```python
import json

from litellm import completion

# set GPT model env variable
os.environ["GPT_MODEL"] = "gpt-4-turbo-preview"

product_price_id_mapping = {

2: Qualification: Qualify the prospect by confirming if they are the right person to talk to regarding your product/service. Ensure that they have the authority to make purchasing decisions.
3: Value proposition: Briefly explain how your product/service can benefit the prospect. Focus on the unique selling points and value proposition of your product/service that sets it apart from competitors.
4: Needs analysis: Ask open-ended questions to uncover the prospect's needs and pain points. Listen carefully to their responses and take notes.

Thought: Do I need to use a tool? Yes
Action: the action to take, should be one of {tools}
Action Input: the input to the action, always a simple string input
Observation: the result of the action
```

If the result of the action is "I don't know." or "Sorry I don't know", then you have to say that to the user as described in the next sentence.
When you have a response to say to the Human, or if you do not need to use a tool, or if tool did not help, you MUST use the format:

```
Thought: Do I need to use a tool? No
{salesperson_name}: [your response here, if previously used a tool, rephrase latest observation, if unable to find the answer, say it]
```

You must respond according to the previous conversation history and the stage of the conversation you are at.

### Installation

The LangChain __SambaNovaCloud__ integration lives in the `langchain_community` package:


```python
%pip install -qU langchain-community
%pip install -qu sseclient-py
```

## Instantiation

Now we can instantiate our model object and generate chat completions:


```python
from langchain_community.chat_models.sambanova import ChatSambaNovaCloud

llm = ChatSambaNovaCloud(
    model="llama3-405b", max_tokens=1024, temperature=0.7, top_k=1, top_p=0.01
)
```

## Invocation


```python
messages = [
    (
        "system",
        "You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French. Translate the user sentence.",
    ),
    ("human", "I love programming."),
]
ai_msg = llm.invoke(messages)
ai_msg
```




    AIMessage(content="J'adore la programmation.", response_metadata={'finish_reason': 'stop', 'usage': {'acceptance_rate': 11, 'completion_tokens': 9, 'completion_tokens_after_first_per_sec': 97.07042823956884, 'completion_tokens_after_first_per_sec_first_ten': 276.3343994441849, 'completion_tokens_per_sec': 23.775192800224037, 'end_time': 1726158364.7954874, 'is_last_response': True, 'prompt_tokens': 56, 'start_time': 1726158364.3670964, 'time_to_first_token': 0.3459765911102295, 'total_latency': 0.3785458261316473, 'total_tokens': 65, 'total_tokens_per_sec': 171.70972577939582}, 'model_name': 'Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct', 'system_fingerprint': 'fastcoe', 'created': 1726158364}, id='7154b676-9d5a-4b1a-a425-73bbe69f28fc')




```python
print(ai_msg.content)
```

    J'adore la programmation.
    

## Chaining

We can [chain](/docs/how_to/sequence/) our model with a prompt template like so:


```python
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

prompt = ChatPromptTemplate(
    [
        (
            "system",
            "You are a helpful assistant that translates {input_language} to {output_language}.",
        ),
        ("human", "{input}"),
    ]
)

chain = prompt | llm
chain.invoke(
    {
        "input_language": "English",
        "output_language": "German",
        "input": "I love programming.",
    }
)
```

## Streaming


```python
system = "You are a helpful assistant with pirate accent."
human = "I want to learn more about this animal: {animal}"
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([("system", system), ("human", human)])

chain = prompt | llm

for chunk in chain.stream({"animal": "owl"}):
    print(chunk.content, end="", flush=True)
```

    Yer lookin' fer some info on owls, eh? Alright then, matey, settle yerself down with a pint o' grog and listen close.
    
    Owls be nocturnal birds o' prey, meanin' they do most o' their huntin' at night. They got big, round eyes that be perfect fer seein' in the dark, like a trusty lantern on a dark sea. Their ears be sharp as a cutlass, too, helpin' 'em pinpoint the slightest sound o' a scurvy rodent scurryin' through the underbrush.
    
    These birds be known fer their silent flight, like a ghost ship sailin' through the night. Their feathers be special, with a soft, fringed edge that helps 'em sneak up on their prey. And when they strike, it be swift and deadly, like a pirate's sword.
    
    Owls be found all over the world, from the frozen tundras o' the north to the scorching deserts o' the south. They come in all shapes and sizes, from the tiny elf owl to the great grey owl, which be as big as a small dog.
    
    Now, I know what ye be thinkin', "Pirate, what about their hootin'?" Aye, owls be famous fer their hoots, which be a form o' communication. They use different hoots to warn off predators, attract a mate, or even just to say, "Shiver me timbers, I be happy to be alive!"
    
    So there ye have it, me hearty. Owls be fascinatin' creatures, and I hope ye found this info as interestin' as a chest overflowin' with gold doubloons. Fair winds and following seas!

)
chain = prompt | llm

async for chunk in chain.astream({"num_words": 30, "topic": "quantum computers"}):
    print(chunk.content, end="", flush=True)

    Arrr, ye landlubber! Ye be wantin' to learn about owls, eh? Well, matey, settle yerself down with a pint o' grog and listen close, for I be tellin' ye about these fascinatin' creatures o' the night!
    
    Owls be birds, but not just any birds, me hearty! They be nocturnal, meanin' they do their huntin' at night, when the rest o' the world be sleepin'. And they be experts at it, too! Their big, round eyes be designed for seein' in the dark, with a special reflective layer called the tapetum lucidum that helps 'em spot prey in the shadows. It's like havin' a built-in lantern, savvy?
    
    But that be not all, me matey! Owls also have acute hearin', which helps 'em pinpoint the slightest sounds in the dark. And their ears be asymmetrical, meanin' one ear be higher than the other, which gives 'em better depth perception. It's like havin' a built-in sonar system, arrr!
    
    Now, ye might be wonderin' how owls fly so silently, like ghosts in the night. Well, it be because o' their special feathers, me hearty! They have soft, fringed feathers on their wings that help reduce noise and turbulence, makin' 'em the sneakiest flyers on the seven seas... er, skies!
    
    Owls come in all shapes and sizes, from the tiny elf owl to the great grey owl, which be one o' the largest owl species in the world. And they be found on every continent, except Antarctica, o' course. They be solitary creatures, but some species be known to form long-term monogamous relationships, like the barn owl and its mate.
    
    So, there ye have it, me hearty! Owls be amazin' creatures, with their clever adaptations and stealthy ways. Now, go forth and spread the word about these magnificent birds o' the night! And remember, if ye ever encounter an owl in the wild, be sure to show respect and keep a weather eye open, or ye might just find yerself on the receivin' end o' a silent, flyin' tackle! Arrr!

# SAP HANA Cloud Vector Engine

>[SAP HANA Cloud Vector Engine](https://www.sap.com/events/teched/news-guide/ai.html#article8) is a vector store fully integrated into the `SAP HANA Cloud` database.

You'll need to install `langchain-community` with `pip install -qU langchain-community` to use this integration

## Setting up

Installation of the HANA database driver.


```python
# Pip install necessary package
%pip install --upgrade --quiet  hdbcli
```

For `OpenAIEmbeddings` we use the OpenAI API key from the environment.


```python
import os
# Use OPENAI_API_KEY env variable
# os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "Your OpenAI API key"
```

Create a database connection to a HANA Cloud instance.


```python
from hdbcli import dbapi

# Use connection settings from the environment
connection = dbapi.connect(
    address=os.environ.get("HANA_DB_ADDRESS"),
    port=os.environ.get("HANA_DB_PORT"),
    user=os.environ.get("HANA_DB_USER"),
    password=os.environ.get("HANA_DB_PASSWORD"),
    autocommit=True,
    sslValidateCertificate=False,
)
```

## Example

Load the sample document "state_of_the_union.txt" and create chunks from it.


```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import TextLoader
from langchain_community.vectorstores.hanavector import HanaDB
from langchain_core.documents import Document
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain_text_splitters import CharacterTextSplitter

text_documents = TextLoader("../../how_to/state_of_the_union.txt").load()
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=0)
text_chunks = text_splitter.split_documents(text_documents)
print(f"Number of document chunks: {len(text_chunks)}")

embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
```

Create a LangChain VectorStore interface for the HANA database and specify the table (collection) to use for accessing the vector embeddings


```python
db = HanaDB(
    embedding=embeddings, connection=connection, table_name="STATE_OF_THE_UNION"
)
```

Add the loaded document chunks to the table. For this example, we delete any previous content from the table which might exist from previous runs.


```python
# Delete already existing documents from the table
db.delete(filter={})

# add the loaded document chunks
db.add_documents(text_chunks)
```

Perform a query to get the two best-matching document chunks from the ones that were added in the previous step.
By default "Cosine Similarity" is used for the search.


```python
query = "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"
docs = db.similarity_search(query, k=2)

for doc in docs:
    print("-" * 80)
    print(doc.page_content)
```

Query the same content with "Euclidian Distance". The results shoud be the same as with "Cosine Similarity".


```python
from langchain_community.vectorstores.utils import DistanceStrategy

db = HanaDB(
    embedding=embeddings,
    connection=connection,
    distance_strategy=DistanceStrategy.EUCLIDEAN_DISTANCE,
    table_name="STATE_OF_THE_UNION",
)

query = "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"
docs = db.similarity_search(query, k=2)
for doc in docs:
    print("-" * 80)
    print(doc.page_content)
```

## Maximal Marginal Relevance Search (MMR)

`Maximal marginal relevance` optimizes for similarity to query AND diversity among selected documents. The first 20 (fetch_k) items will be retrieved from the DB. The MMR algorithm will then find the best 2 (k) matches.


```python
docs = db.max_marginal_relevance_search(query, k=2, fetch_k=20)
for doc in docs:
    print("-" * 80)
    print(doc.page_content)
```

## Basic Vectorstore Operations


```python
db = HanaDB(
    connection=connection, embedding=embeddings, table_name="LANGCHAIN_DEMO_BASIC"
)

# Delete already existing documents from the table
db.delete(filter={})
```

We can add simple text documents to the existing table.


```python
docs = [Document(page_content="Some text"), Document(page_content="Other docs")]
db.add_documents(docs)
```

Add documents with metadata.


```python
docs = [
    Document(
        page_content="foo",
        metadata={"start": 100, "end": 150, "doc_name": "foo.txt", "quality": "bad"},
    ),
    Document(
        page_content="bar",
        metadata={"start": 200, "end": 250, "doc_name": "bar.txt", "quality": "good"},
    ),
]
db.add_documents(docs)
```

Query documents with specific metadata.


```python
docs = db.similarity_search("foobar", k=2, filter={"quality": "bad"})
# With filtering on "quality"=="bad", only one document should be returned
for doc in docs:
    print("-" * 80)
    print(doc.page_content)
    print(doc.metadata)
```

Delete documents with specific metadata.


```python
db.delete(filter={"quality": "bad"})

# Now the similarity search with the same filter will return no results
docs = db.similarity_search("foobar", k=2, filter={"quality": "bad"})
print(len(docs))
```

## Advanced filtering
In addition to the basic value-based filtering capabilities, it is possible to use more advanced filtering.
The table below shows the available filter operators.

| Operator | Semantic                 |
|----------|-------------------------|
| `$eq`    | Equality (==)           |
| `$ne`    | Inequality (!=)         |
| `$lt`    | Less than (&lt;)           |
| `$lte`   | Less than or equal (&lt;=) |
| `$gt`    | Greater than (>)        |
| `$gte`   | Greater than or equal (>=) |
| `$in`    | Contained in a set of given values  (in)    |
| `$nin`   | Not contained in a set of given values  (not in)  |
| `$between` | Between the range of two boundary values |
| `$like`  | Text equality based on the "LIKE" semantics in SQL (using "%" as wildcard)  |
| `$and`   | Logical "and", supporting 2 or more operands |
| `$or`    | Logical "or", supporting 2 or more operands |


```python
# Prepare some test documents
docs = [
    Document(
        page_content="First",
        metadata={"name": "adam", "is_active": True, "id": 1, "height": 10.0},
    ),
    Document(
        page_content="Second",
        metadata={"name": "bob", "is_active": False, "id": 2, "height": 5.7},
    ),
    Document(
        page_content="Third",
        metadata={"name": "jane", "is_active": True, "id": 3, "height": 2.4},
    ),
]

db = HanaDB(
    connection=connection,
    embedding=embeddings,
    table_name="LANGCHAIN_DEMO_ADVANCED_FILTER",
)

# Delete already existing documents from the table
db.delete(filter={})
db.add_documents(docs)


# Helper function for printing filter results
def print_filter_result(result):
    if len(result) == 0:
        print("<empty result>")
    for doc in result:
        print(doc.metadata)
```

Filtering with `$ne`, `$gt`, `$gte`, `$lt`, `$lte`


```python
advanced_filter = {"id": {"$ne": 1}}
print(f"Filter: {advanced_filter}")
print_filter_result(db.similarity_search("just testing", k=5, filter=advanced_filter))

advanced_filter = {"id": {"$gt": 1}}
print(f"Filter: {advanced_filter}")
print_filter_result(db.similarity_search("just testing", k=5, filter=advanced_filter))

advanced_filter = {"id": {"$gte": 1}}
print(f"Filter: {advanced_filter}")
print_filter_result(db.similarity_search("just testing", k=5, filter=advanced_filter))

advanced_filter = {"id": {"$lt": 1}}
print(f"Filter: {advanced_filter}")
print_filter_result(db.similarity_search("just testing", k=5, filter=advanced_filter))

advanced_filter = {"id": {"$lte": 1}}
print(f"Filter: {advanced_filter}")
print_filter_result(db.similarity_search("just testing", k=5, filter=advanced_filter))
```

Filtering with `$between`, `$in`, `$nin`


```python
advanced_filter = {"id": {"$between": (1, 2)}}
print(f"Filter: {advanced_filter}")
print_filter_result(db.similarity_search("just testing", k=5, filter=advanced_filter))

advanced_filter = {"name": {"$in": ["adam", "bob"]}}
print(f"Filter: {advanced_filter}")
print_filter_result(db.similarity_search("just testing", k=5, filter=advanced_filter))

advanced_filter = {"name": {"$nin": ["adam", "bob"]}}
print(f"Filter: {advanced_filter}")
print_filter_result(db.similarity_search("just testing", k=5, filter=advanced_filter))
```

Text filtering with `$like`


```python
advanced_filter = {"name": {"$like": "a%"}}
print(f"Filter: {advanced_filter}")
print_filter_result(db.similarity_search("just testing", k=5, filter=advanced_filter))

advanced_filter = {"name": {"$like": "%a%"}}
print(f"Filter: {advanced_filter}")
print_filter_result(db.similarity_search("just testing", k=5, filter=advanced_filter))
```

Combined filtering with `$and`, `$or`


```python
advanced_filter = {"$or": [{"id": 1}, {"name": "bob"}]}
print(f"Filter: {advanced_filter}")
print_filter_result(db.similarity_search("just testing", k=5, filter=advanced_filter))

advanced_filter = {"$and": [{"id": 1}, {"id": 2}]}
print(f"Filter: {advanced_filter}")
print_filter_result(db.similarity_search("just testing", k=5, filter=advanced_filter))

advanced_filter = {"$or": [{"id": 1}, {"id": 2}, {"id": 3}]}
print(f"Filter: {advanced_filter}")
print_filter_result(db.similarity_search("just testing", k=5, filter=advanced_filter))
```

## Using a VectorStore as a retriever in chains for retrieval augmented generation (RAG)


```python
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# Access the vector DB with a new table
db = HanaDB(
    connection=connection,
    embedding=embeddings,
    table_name="LANGCHAIN_DEMO_RETRIEVAL_CHAIN",
)

# Delete already existing entries from the table
db.delete(filter={})

# add the loaded document chunks from the "State Of The Union" file
db.add_documents(text_chunks)

# Create a retriever instance of the vector store
retriever = db.as_retriever()
```

Define the prompt.


```python
from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate

prompt_template = """
You are an expert in state of the union topics. You are provided multiple context items that are related to the prompt you have to answer.
Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

'''
{context}
'''

Question: {question}
"""

PROMPT = PromptTemplate(
    template=prompt_template, input_variables=["context", "question"]
)
chain_type_kwargs = {"prompt": PROMPT}
```

Create the ConversationalRetrievalChain, which handles the chat history and the retrieval of similar document chunks to be added to the prompt.


```python
from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain

llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo")
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(
    memory_key="chat_history", output_key="answer", return_messages=True
)
qa_chain = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(
    llm,
    db.as_retriever(search_kwargs={"k": 5}),
    return_source_documents=True,
    memory=memory,
    verbose=False,
    combine_docs_chain_kwargs={"prompt": PROMPT},
)
```

Ask the first question (and verify how many text chunks have been used).


```python
question = "What about Mexico and Guatemala?"

result = qa_chain.invoke({"question": question})
print("Answer from LLM:")
print("================")
print(result["answer"])

source_docs = result["source_documents"]
print("================")
print(f"Number of used source document chunks: {len(source_docs)}")
```

Examine the used chunks of the chain in detail. Check if the best ranked chunk contains info about "Mexico and Guatemala" as mentioned in the question.


```python
for doc in source_docs:
    print("-" * 80)
    print(doc.page_content)
    print(doc.metadata)
```

Ask another question on the same conversational chain. The answer should relate to the previous answer given.


```python
question = "What about other countries?"

result = qa_chain.invoke({"question": question})
print("Answer from LLM:")
print("================")
print(result["answer"])
```

## Standard tables vs. "custom" tables with vector data

As default behaviour, the table for the embeddings is created with 3 columns:

- A column `VEC_TEXT`, which contains the text of the Document
- A column `VEC_META`, which contains the metadata of the Document
- A column `VEC_VECTOR`, which contains the embeddings-vector of the Document's text


```python
# Access the vector DB with a new table
db = HanaDB(
    connection=connection, embedding=embeddings, table_name="LANGCHAIN_DEMO_NEW_TABLE"
)

# Delete already existing entries from the table
db.delete(filter={})

# Add a simple document with some metadata
docs = [
    Document(
        page_content="A simple document",
        metadata={"start": 100, "end": 150, "doc_name": "simple.txt"},
    )
]
db.add_documents(docs)
```

Show the columns in table "LANGCHAIN_DEMO_NEW_TABLE"


```python
cur = connection.cursor()
cur.execute(
    "SELECT COLUMN_NAME, DATA_TYPE_NAME FROM SYS.TABLE_COLUMNS WHERE SCHEMA_NAME = CURRENT_SCHEMA AND TABLE_NAME = 'LANGCHAIN_DEMO_NEW_TABLE'"
)
rows = cur.fetchall()
for row in rows:
    print(row)
cur.close()
```

Show the value of the inserted document in the three columns 


```python
cur = connection.cursor()
cur.execute(
    "SELECT VEC_TEXT, VEC_META, TO_NVARCHAR(VEC_VECTOR) FROM LANGCHAIN_DEMO_NEW_TABLE LIMIT 1"
)
rows = cur.fetchall()
print(rows[0][0])  # The text
print(rows[0][1])  # The metadata
print(rows[0][2])  # The vector
cur.close()
```

Custom tables must have at least three columns that match the semantics of a standard table

- A column with type `NCLOB` or `NVARCHAR` for the text/context of the embeddings
- A column with type `NCLOB` or `NVARCHAR` for the metadata 
- A column with type `REAL_VECTOR` for the embedding vector

The table can contain additional columns. When new Documents are inserted into the table, these additional columns must allow NULL values.


```python
# Create a new table "MY_OWN_TABLE" with three "standard" columns and one additional column
my_own_table_name = "MY_OWN_TABLE"
cur = connection.cursor()
cur.execute(
    (
        f"CREATE TABLE {my_own_table_name} ("
        "SOME_OTHER_COLUMN NVARCHAR(42), "
        "MY_TEXT NVARCHAR(2048), "
        "MY_METADATA NVARCHAR(1024), "
        "MY_VECTOR REAL_VECTOR )"
    )
)

# Create a HanaDB instance with the own table
db = HanaDB(
    connection=connection,
    embedding=embeddings,
    table_name=my_own_table_name,
    content_column="MY_TEXT",
    metadata_column="MY_METADATA",
    vector_column="MY_VECTOR",
)

# Add a simple document with some metadata
docs = [
    Document(
        page_content="Some other text",
        metadata={"start": 400, "end": 450, "doc_name": "other.txt"},
    )
]
db.add_documents(docs)

# Check if data has been inserted into our own table
cur.execute(f"SELECT * FROM {my_own_table_name} LIMIT 1")
rows = cur.fetchall()
print(rows[0][0])  # Value of column "SOME_OTHER_DATA". Should be NULL/None
print(rows[0][1])  # The text
print(rows[0][2])  # The metadata
print(rows[0][3])  # The vector

cur.close()
```

Add another document and perform a similarity search on the custom table.


```python
docs = [
    Document(
        page_content="Some more text",
        metadata={"start": 800, "end": 950, "doc_name": "more.txt"},
    )
]
db.add_documents(docs)

query = "What's up?"
docs = db.similarity_search(query, k=2)
for doc in docs:
    print("-" * 80)
    print(doc.page_content)
```

### Filter Performance Optimization with Custom Columns

To allow flexible metadata values, all metadata is stored as JSON in the metadata column by default. If some of the used metadata keys and value types are known, they can be stored in additional columns instead by creating the target table with the key names as column names and passing them to the HanaDB constructor via the specific_metadata_columns list. Metadata keys that match those values are copied into the special column during insert. Filters use the special columns instead of the metadata JSON column for keys in the specific_metadata_columns list.


```python
# Create a new table "PERFORMANT_CUSTOMTEXT_FILTER" with three "standard" columns and one additional column
my_own_table_name = "PERFORMANT_CUSTOMTEXT_FILTER"
cur = connection.cursor()
cur.execute(
    (
        f"CREATE TABLE {my_own_table_name} ("
        "CUSTOMTEXT NVARCHAR(500), "
        "MY_TEXT NVARCHAR(2048), "
        "MY_METADATA NVARCHAR(1024), "
        "MY_VECTOR REAL_VECTOR )"
    )
)

# Create a HanaDB instance with the own table
db = HanaDB(
    connection=connection,
    embedding=embeddings,
    table_name=my_own_table_name,
    content_column="MY_TEXT",
    metadata_column="MY_METADATA",
    vector_column="MY_VECTOR",
    specific_metadata_columns=["CUSTOMTEXT"],
)

# Add a simple document with some metadata
docs = [
    Document(
        page_content="Some other text",
        metadata={
            "start": 400,
            "end": 450,
            "doc_name": "other.txt",
            "CUSTOMTEXT": "Filters on this value are very performant",
        },
    )
]
db.add_documents(docs)

# Check if data has been inserted into our own table
cur.execute(f"SELECT * FROM {my_own_table_name} LIMIT 1")
rows = cur.fetchall()
print(
    rows[0][0]
)  # Value of column "CUSTOMTEXT". Should be "Filters on this value are very performant"
print(rows[0][1])  # The text
print(
    rows[0][2]
)  # The metadata without the "CUSTOMTEXT" data, as this is extracted into a sperate column
print(rows[0][3])  # The vector

cur.close()
```

The special columns are completely transparent to the rest of the langchain interface. Everything works as it did before, just more performant.


```python
docs = [
    Document(
        page_content="Some more text",
        metadata={
            "start": 800,
            "end": 950,
            "doc_name": "more.txt",
            "CUSTOMTEXT": "Another customtext value",
        },
    )
]
db.add_documents(docs)

advanced_filter = {"CUSTOMTEXT": {"$like": "%value%"}}
query = "What's up?"
docs = db.similarity_search(query, k=2, filter=advanced_filter)
for doc in docs:
    print("-" * 80)
    print(doc.page_content)
```

# ScaNN

ScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors) is a method for efficient vector similarity search at scale.

ScaNN includes search space pruning and quantization for Maximum Inner Product Search and also supports other distance functions such as Euclidean distance. The implementation is optimized for x86 processors with AVX2 support. See its [Google Research github](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/scann) for more details.

You'll need to install `langchain-community` with `pip install -qU langchain-community` to use this integration

## Installation
Install ScaNN through pip. Alternatively, you can follow instructions on the [ScaNN Website](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/scann#building-from-source) to install from source.


```python
%pip install --upgrade --quiet  scann
```

## Retrieval Demo

Below we show how to use ScaNN in conjunction with Huggingface Embeddings.


```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import TextLoader
from langchain_community.vectorstores import ScaNN
from langchain_huggingface import HuggingFaceEmbeddings
from langchain_text_splitters import CharacterTextSplitter

loader = TextLoader("state_of_the_union.txt")
documents = loader.load()
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
docs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)


model_name = "sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2"
embeddings = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name=model_name)

db = ScaNN.from_documents(docs, embeddings)
query = "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"
docs = db.similarity_search(query)

docs[0]
```

## RetrievalQA Demo

Next, we demonstrate using ScaNN in conjunction with Google PaLM API.

You can obtain an API key from https://developers.generativeai.google/tutorials/setup


```python
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
from langchain_community.chat_models.google_palm import ChatGooglePalm

palm_client = ChatGooglePalm(google_api_key="YOUR_GOOGLE_PALM_API_KEY")

qa = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
    llm=palm_client,
    chain_type="stuff",
    retriever=db.as_retriever(search_kwargs={"k": 10}),
)
```


```python
print(qa.run("What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson?"))
```

    The president said that Ketanji Brown Jackson is one of our nation's top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer's legacy of excellence.
    


```python
print(qa.run("What did the president say about Michael Phelps?"))
```

    The president did not mention Michael Phelps in his speech.
    

## Save and loading local retrieval index


```python
db.save_local("/tmp/db", "state_of_union")
restored_db = ScaNN.load_local("/tmp/db", embeddings, index_name="state_of_union")
```

    Observation: [36;1m[1;3mIn a charmingly whimsical scene, a young girl is seen braving the rain alongside her furry companion, the lovable Totoro. The two are depicted standing on a bustling street corner, where they are sheltered from the rain by a bright yellow umbrella. The girl, dressed in a cheerful yellow frock, holds onto the umbrella with both hands while gazing up at Totoro with an expression of wonder and delight.
    
    Totoro, meanwhile, stands tall and proud beside his young friend, holding his own umbrella aloft to protect them both from the downpour. His furry body is rendered in rich shades of grey and white, while his large ears and wide eyes lend him an endearing charm.
    
    In the background of the scene, a street sign can be seen jutting out from the pavement amidst a flurry of raindrops. A sign with Chinese characters adorns its surface, adding to the sense of cultural diversity and intrigue. Despite the dreary weather, there is an undeniable sense of joy and camaraderie in this heartwarming image.[0m

```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import ScrapingAntLoader

scrapingant_config = {
    "browser": True,  # Enable browser rendering with a cloud browser
    "proxy_type": "datacenter",  # Select a proxy type (datacenter or residential)

# Synthetic Data generation (Part 1)


Synthetic data generation using large language models (LLMs) offers a powerful solution to a commonly faced problem: the availability of high-quality, diverse, and privacy-compliant data. This could be used in a number of scenarios such as training a data science  machine learning model (SVMs, decision trees, KNN's), finetuning a different GPT model on the data, as a solution to the coldstart problem, helping build compelling demos/apps with realistic data, scenario testing etc.

There are a number of key drivers which may see you wanting to leverage synthetic data. 
1. Human data may have privacy restrictions and/or identifiable data within it which we do not want to be used. 
2. Synthetic data can be much more structured and therefore easier to manipulate than real data. 
3. In domains where data is sparse or data of certain categories is sparse we may want to augment the data. 
4. When dealing with imbalanced datasets or datasets which lack diversity, we may want to create data to improve the richness of our datasets.

Unlike traditional data augmentation or manual data creation methods, using LLMs allows for the generation of rich, nuanced, and contextually relevant datasets that can significantly enhance it's usefulness to enterprises and developers.

We split this tutorial into 2 parts. In this cookbook, we will have the following agenda:
1. CSV with a structured prompt
2. CSV with a Python program
3. Multitable CSV with a python program
4. Simply creating textual data
5. Dealing with imbalanced or non-diverse textual data
while in part 2, we will look at prompting strategies for getting better textual data.

The last two in particular are useful for creating synthetic data to finetune another GPT model. For example using higher quality data produced by `gpt-4o` to finetune the cheaper and quicker `gpt-3.5-turbo` for improved performance while reducing costs.


### Getting setup


```python
%pip install openai
%pip install pandas
%pip install scikit-learn
%pip install matplotlib
```


```python
from openai import OpenAI
import os
import re
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import json
import matplotlib

client = OpenAI(api_key=os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY", "<your OpenAI API key if not set as env var>"))
```

### 1. CSV with a structure prompt
Here we create data in the simplest way. You can quickly generate data by addressing 3 key points: telling it the format of the data (CSV), the schema, and useful information regarding how columns relate (the LLM will be able to deduce this from the column names but a helping hand will improve performance).


```python
datagen_model = "gpt-4o-mini"
question = """
Create a CSV file with 10 rows of housing data.
Each row should include the following fields:
 - id (incrementing integer starting at 1)
 - house size (m^2)
 - house price
 - location
 - number of bedrooms

Make sure that the numbers make sense (i.e. more rooms is usually bigger size, more expensive locations increase price. more size is usually higher price etc. make sure all the numbers make sense). Also only respond with the CSV.
"""

response = client.chat.completions.create(
  model=datagen_model,
  messages=[
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant designed to generate synthetic data."},
    {"role": "user", "content": question}
  ]
)
res = response.choices[0].message.content
print(res)
```

    ```csv
    id,house_size_m2,house_price,location,number_of_bedrooms
    1,50,150000,Suburban,2
    2,75,250000,City Center,3
    3,100,350000,Suburban,4
    4,120,450000,Suburban,4
    5,80,300000,City Center,3
    6,90,400000,City Center,3
    7,150,600000,Premium Area,5
    8,200,750000,Premium Area,5
    9,55,180000,Suburban,2
    10,300,950000,Premium Area,6
    ```
    

### 2. CSV with a Python program
The issue with generating data directly is we are limited in the amount of data we can generate because of the context. Instead what we can do is ask the LLM to generate a python program to generate the synthetic data. This allows us to scale to much more data while also providing us a view into how the data was generated by inspecting the python program.

This would then let us edit the python program as we desire while giving us a good basis to start from.



```python
question = """
Create a Python program to generate 100 rows of housing data.
I want you to at the end of it output a pandas dataframe with 100 rows of data.
Each row should include the following fields:
 - id (incrementing integer starting at 1)
 - house size (m^2)
 - house price
 - location
 - number of bedrooms

Make sure that the numbers make sense (i.e. more rooms is usually bigger size, more expensive locations increase price. more size is usually higher price etc. make sure all the numbers make sense).
"""

response = client.chat.completions.create(
  model=datagen_model,
  messages=[
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant designed to generate synthetic data."},
    {"role": "user", "content": question}
  ]
)
res = response.choices[0].message.content
print(res)
```

    Certainly! Below is a Python program that generates synthetic housing data according to your specifications. We will create a pandas DataFrame with the defined fields and characteristics.
    
    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    import random
    
    def generate_housing_data(num_rows):
        data = []
        
        locations = [
            ('City Center', 10000, 150),  # (location name, base price per m², base size)
            ('Suburban Area', 8000, 100),
            ('Country Side', 5000, 80),
            ('Coastal Region', 12000, 110),
            ('Urban Neighborhood', 9000, 130)
        ]
        
        for i in range(1, num_rows + 1):
            # Randomly pick a location
            location, base_price_per_m2, base_size = random.choice(locations)
            
            # Generate number of bedrooms (1 to 5)
            number_of_bedrooms = random.randint(1, 5)
            
            # Calculate house size based on the number of bedrooms
            house_size = base_size + (10 * number_of_bedrooms) + random.randint(-5, 15)  # Adding some noise
            
            # Calculate house price based on house size and location
            house_price = base_price_per_m2 * house_size + random.randint(-5000, 10000)  # Adding some noise
    
            # Append the generated data to the list
            data.append({
                'id': i,
                'house_size_m2': house_size,
                'house_price': house_price,
                'location': location,
                'number_of_bedrooms': number_of_bedrooms
            })
    
        # Create a pandas DataFrame
        df = pd.DataFrame(data)
        return df
    
    # Generate 100 rows of housing data
    housing_data_df = generate_housing_data(100)
    
    # Show the result
    print(housing_data_df)
    ```
    
    ### Explanation:
    - The `generate_housing_data` function creates synthetic housing data for a specified number of rows (`num_rows`).
    - We define different locations with corresponding base prices per square meter and average house sizes.
    - For each house, we randomly select a location, number of bedrooms, and calculate house size and price to ensure a sensible correlation between the values.
    - Finally, we create a pandas DataFrame from the generated data and return it.
    
    You can run this program in your Python environment, and it will output a DataFrame containing 100 rows of synthetic housing data.
    

We need to make sure to parse the output of this appropriately as often there may be surrounding text to the python code. We can also explicitly ask it to state all assumptions it made about the data it's generating, however in this circumstance it told us that automatically.

### 3. Multitable CSV with a python program
For more complex relationships however we need to make sure to specify a few more characteristics. 

To create multiple different datasets which relate to each other (for example housing, location, house type), as before we would need to specify the format, schema and useful information. However, the useful information required to get good performance is higher now. It's case-specific but a good amount of things to describe would be how the datasets relate to each other, addressing the size of the datasets in relation to one another, making sure foreign and primary keys are made appropriately and ideally using previously generated datasets to populate new ones so the actual data values match where necessary.


```python
question = """
Create a Python program to generate 3 different pandas dataframes.

1. Housing data
I want 100 rows. Each row should include the following fields:
 - id (incrementing integer starting at 1)
 - house size (m^2)
 - house price
 - location
 - number of bedrooms
 - house type
 + any relevant foreign keys

2. Location
Each row should include the following fields:
 - id (incrementing integer starting at 1)
 - country
 - city
 - population
 - area (m^2)
 + any relevant foreign keys

 3. House types
 - id (incrementing integer starting at 1)
 - house type
 - average house type price
 - number of houses
 + any relevant foreign keys

Make sure that the numbers make sense (i.e. more rooms is usually bigger size, more expensive locations increase price. more size is usually higher price etc. make sure all the numbers make sense).
Make sure that the dataframe generally follow common sense checks, e.g. the size of the dataframes make sense in comparison with one another.
Make sure the foreign keys match up and you can use previously generated dataframes when creating each consecutive dataframes.
You can use the previously generated dataframe to generate the next dataframe.
"""

response = client.chat.completions.create(
  model=datagen_model,
  messages=[
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant designed to generate synthetic data."},
    {"role": "user", "content": question}
  ]
)
res = response.choices[0].message.content
print(res)
```

    Certainly! Below is a Python program that generates the three specified pandas DataFrames for housing data, location data, and house types. Each DataFrame will include the necessary fields, and the foreign keys will ensure proper relationships among them.
    
    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np

    np.random.seed(0)

        locations = {

        }
        return pd.DataFrame(locations)
    
    # Function to generate house types DataFrame
    def generate_house_type_data(num_house_types):
        house_types = {
            "id": range(1, num_house_types + 1),

    ### Explanation of the Code:
    1. **Location DataFrame:** 
       - Generates random locations with attributes such as country, city, population, and area.
      
    2. **House Types DataFrame:** 
       - Generates different types of houses along with average prices and quantity available.
      
    3. **Housing DataFrame:** 
       - Generates housing data with increments on price based on house size, location, and house type, while also ensuring foreign keys (IDs) for location and house type.
    
    ### Output:
    The three DataFrames generated will logically relate to one another with consistent data types and primary–foreign key relationships, resulting in a coherent representation of the housing dataset. The output displays heads of each DataFrame and their shapes for verification.
    

### 4. Simply creating textual data
Here we take a first look at creating textual data. This can be used to finetune another GPT model for example. In this case we imagine ourselves a retailer trying to streamline the process of creating descriptions for items they are selling. We again need to specify the format of the data, in particular in this case we want one which is easy to parse as an output.

The example we consider below is one in which we want to create input output training pairs for GPT model to finetune on. We will have the products' name and the category it belongs to as input and the output will be a description. 

Specifying the structure of the output explicitly and giving commands to not deviate from this help enforce the output structure. You can run this in a loop and append the data to generate more synthetic data. Again, as before we will need to parse the data well so that our code further downstream does not break.


```python
output_string = ""
for i in range(3):
  question = f"""
  I am creating input output training pairs to fine tune my gpt model. The usecase is a retailer generating a description for a product from a product catalogue. I want the input to be product name and category (to which the product belongs to) and output to be description.
  The format should be of the form:
  1.
  Input: product_name, category
  Output: description
  2.
  Input: product_name, category
  Output: description

  Do not add any extra characters around that formatting as it will make the output parsing break.
  Create as many training pairs as possible.

pattern = re.compile(r'Input:\s*(.+?),\s*(.+?)\nOutput:\s*(.+?)(?=\n\n|\Z)', re.DOTALL)
matches = pattern.findall(output_string)

### 5. Dealing with imbalanced or non-diverse textual data
Some of the most important aspects of generating high-quality synthetic data are accuracy (does the data make sense), consistency (are two separate data points for the same input roughly the same) and diversity (making sure our data distribution matches as much of the distribution that exists in production).


To increase the diversity of our data, we start first by clustering the data. This will provide us information about which clusters are underrepresented (imbalanced dataset) or which data is not addressed at all (widening the data distribution). Then, we will either suggest new clusters (using self-reflection type call from GPT) or ask the next iteration of our synthetic generation calls to explicitly target the underrepresented clusters. 

We can then recursively run this generation and analysis of cluster loop to automate generating diverse synthetic data.

For demonstrative purposes, we explicitly prompt the LLM to generate information about 4 different topical areas: vehicle, clothing, toiletries, food. We will then cluster the data and see if it managed to find these 4 topic areas.


```python
output_string = ""
for i in range(3):
  question = f"""
  I am creating input output training pairs to fine tune my gpt model. I want the input to be product name and category and output to be description. the category should be things like: mobile phones, shoes, headphones, laptop, electronic toothbrush, etc. and also more importantly the categories should come under 4 main topics: vehicle, clothing, toiletries, food)
  After the number of each example also state the topic area. The format should be of the form:
  1. topic_area
  Input: product_name, category
  Output: description

  Do not add any extra characters around that formatting as it will make the output parsing break.

  Here are some helpful examples so you get the style of output correct.

  1) clothing
  Input: "Shoe Name, Shoes"
  Output: "Experience unparalleled comfort. These shoes feature a blend of modern style and the traditional superior cushioning, perfect for those always on the move."
  """

  response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[
      {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant designed to generate synthetic data."},
      {"role": "user", "content": question}
    ]
  )
  res = response.choices[0].message.content
  output_string += res + "\n" + "\n"
print(output_string[:1000]) #displaying truncated response
```

    1. vehicle  
    Input: "Tesla Model 3, Electric Car"  
    Output: "The Tesla Model 3 is a revolutionary electric car with impressive range and cutting-edge technology, designed to provide an exhilarating driving experience while minimizing environmental impact."
    
    2. clothing  
    Input: "Nike Air Max, Shoes"  
    Output: "Elevate your sneaker game with Nike Air Max. Combining iconic style with superior comfort and support, these shoes are perfect for both workouts and casual outings."
    
    3. toiletries  
    Input: "Oral-B Pro 1000, Electronic Toothbrush"  
    Output: "Achieve a superior clean with the Oral-B Pro 1000. This electronic toothbrush features 3D cleaning action that pulsates and oscillates to remove more plaque than a regular manual toothbrush."
    
    4. food  
    Input: "Chobani Greek Yogurt, Yogurt"  
    Output: "Indulge in a nutritious snack with Chobani Greek Yogurt. Packed with protein and delicious flavors, it’s the perfect choice for a healthy breakfast or a satisfying treat anytime."
    
    5. vehicle  
    
    

Note: The above output is truncated. In the example above, we would explicitly include the topic area as part of the response per example as it helps condition the proceeding output and tends to give better performance. We can also give it an actual example of what the output should look like so it gets the right idea of style of output but also to help enforce structure.


```python
pattern = re.compile(r'(\d+)\.\s*(\w+)\s*Input:\s*"(.+?),\s*(.+?)"\s*Output:\s*"(.*?)"', re.DOTALL)
matches = pattern.findall(output_string)

topics = []
products = []
categories = []
descriptions = []

for match in matches:
    number, topic, product, category, description = match
    topics.append(topic)
    products.append(product)
    categories.append(category)
    descriptions.append(description)

```


```python
products
```




    ['Tesla Model 3',
     'Nike Air Max',
     'Oral-B Pro 1000',
     'Chobani Greek Yogurt',
     'Ford F-150',
     "Levi's 511",
     'Philips Sonicare',

We will now cluster the data to analyze it. We will use K-means clustering to segregate the data. An important parameter of K-means to set is K, the number of clusters.

We know that there should be 4 cluster (4 topics) since we specified this in prompt: vehicle, electronics, clothing, food. However in general for our data, we do not know the number of clusters that exist. Therefore we will use the elbow method to find the optimal number of clusters.

In the elbow method, we iterate through a range of different K's, each time storing the inertia. The inertia measures the sum of the squared distances between each point in a cluster and the centroid of that cluster thus telling us how well-separated and dense each cluster is. If we plot K against the inertia, we are able to see how the inertia drops and where the drop in inertia is least rapid (often making an elbow shape) we can set our optimal number of clusters. You can read into more depth about the elbow method [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow_method_(clustering)).

First let's store our data into a pandas dataframe for ease of analysis




```python
data = {
    'Product': products,
    'Category': categories,
    'Description': descriptions
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
```

Next let us embed our data as the embeddings is what we will cluster since they should be close to each other in vector space if they are similar.


```python
def get_embedding(text, model="text-embedding-3-small"):
    text = text.replace("\n", " ")

    response = client.embeddings.create(input=[text], model=model)

    return response.data[0].embedding

embedding_model = "text-embedding-3-small"
df["embedding"] = df.Category.apply(lambda x: get_embedding(x, model=embedding_model))

# Ensure there are embeddings to concatenate
if len(df.embedding.values) > 0:
    matrix = np.vstack(df.embedding.values)
else:
    matrix = np.array([])  # Handle the case where there are no embeddings

```


```python
df
```

Now we perform the elbow method. 


```python
# Determine the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method
inertias = []
range_of_clusters = range(1, 13)  # Adjust the range as necessary

for n_clusters in range_of_clusters:
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=n_clusters, init="k-means++", random_state=42, n_init=10)
    kmeans.fit(matrix)
    inertias.append(kmeans.inertia_)

```

This will output a chart for us in which we have to visually tell where the optimal cluster point is. We can see below that we see a gradual decrease of inertia rather than a sharp elbow but the point of steepest decrease appears to occur around 3, 4 or 5 clusters which lines up with our expectations given our prompt. 


```python
# Plotting the elbow plot
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(range_of_clusters, inertias, '-o')
plt.title('Elbow Method to Determine Optimal Number of Clusters')
plt.xlabel('Number of Clusters')
plt.ylabel('Inertia')
plt.xticks(range_of_clusters)
plt.show()
```


    
![png](output_32_0.png)
    


![elbow_chart](../images/elbow_chart.png)

For demonstration purposes we will pick 5 as the optimal cluster number to show it doesn't matter exactly where we pick it as long as we are approximately right. There are numerous correct ways to categorize data. We also store which cluster each data point belongs to.


```python
n_clusters = 5

kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=n_clusters, init="k-means++", random_state=42)
kmeans.fit(matrix)
labels = kmeans.labels_
df["Cluster"] = labels
```

We will analyze the cluster data now. There are two separate things we will look to address. 1. imbalanced data, 2. Expanding the data distribution.

First for imbalanced data we count the number of examples in each cluster. Then we select a few examples from each cluster at random and ask the LLM what topics these map to. 


```python
cluster_counts = df["Cluster"].value_counts().sort_index()
print(cluster_counts)
```

    Cluster
    0    5
    1    7
    2    8
    3    6
    4    2
    Name: count, dtype: int64
    

We can see the topics found here:
Eco-friendly Transportation, Luxury and Leisure Items, Personal Care Products, Electronic Toothbrushes and Clothing and Apparel
match well enough but not exactly to our initial prompt of:
vehicle, clothing, toiletries, food.

As we chose 5 clusters, it split up toiletries into Skincare and Personal Care which doesn't affect us too much further downstream.


```python
df

      {

      }
    ]
    

We now have the clusters and their counts so we could prompt the LLM to generate more examples within the topics we want. However for this example we won't take that further as they are well-split and you would just follow the procedure above for prompting the model to generate data while passing in the underrepresented topics.

Next, we will try and deal with increasing the diversity of our data distribution. 

First we start in a similar way by finding a few examples from each cluster at random and ask the LLM what topics these map to. In addition to this in the same LLM call, we will ask it to generate more topics to increase the diversity of our data. We do this in one call to save time/cost.


```python
selected_examples = df.groupby('Cluster').apply(lambda x: x.sample(3, replace=True)).reset_index(drop=True)

# Format the selected examples
formatted_examples = "\n".join(
    f'Input: "{row["Product"]}, {row["Category"]}"\nOutput: "{row["Description"]}"\nCluster: "{row["Cluster"]}"'
    for _, row in selected_examples.iterrows()

topic_prompt = f"""
    I previously generated some examples of input output trainings pairs and then I clustered them based on category. From each cluster I picked 3 example data point which you can find below.
    I want to promote diversity in my examples across categories so follow the procedure below:
    1. You must identify the broad topic areas these clusters belong to.
    2. You should generate further topic areas which don't exist so I can generate data within these topics to improve diversity.


    Previous examples:
    {formatted_examples}


    Your output should be strictly of the format:

    1. Cluster topic mapping
    Cluster: number, topic: topic
    Cluster: number, topic: topic
    Cluster: number, topic: topic

    2. New topics
    1. topic
    2. topic
    3. topic
    4. topic

    Do not add any extra characters around that formatting as it will make the output parsing break. It is very important you stick to that output format
    """

response = client.chat.completions.create(
  model=datagen_model,
  messages=[
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant designed to analyze clustered data"},
    {"role": "user", "content": topic_prompt}
  ]
)
res = response.choices[0].message.content
print(res)

```

    1. Cluster topic mapping
    Cluster: 0, topic: Automotive
    Cluster: 1, topic: Personal Care
    Cluster: 2, topic: Footwear
    Cluster: 3, topic: Food
    Cluster: 4, topic: Electric Vehicles
    
    2. New topics
    1. topic: Home Appliances
    2. topic: Outdoor Equipment
    3. topic: Smart Home Technology
    4. topic: Fitness Equipment
    

We can see here again that we explicitly prompt the output structure it should follow. I also tell it the purpose of generating topics (to promote diversity) so the model has full context.

We then parse the data into a list of cluster-mapping jsons and a list of topics


```python
parts = res.split("\n\n")
cluster_mapping_part = parts[0]
new_topics_part = parts[1]

# Parse cluster topic mapping
cluster_topic_mapping_lines = cluster_mapping_part.split("\n")[1:]  # Skip the first two lines
cluster_topic_mapping = [{"cluster": int(line.split(",")[0].split(":")[1].strip()), "topic": line.split(":")[2].strip()} for line in cluster_topic_mapping_lines]

# Parse new topics
new_topics_lines = new_topics_part.split("\n")[1:]  # Skip the first line
new_topics = [line.split(". ")[1] for line in new_topics_lines]

cluster_topic_mapping, new_topics
```




    ([{'cluster': 0, 'topic': 'Automotive'},
      {'cluster': 1, 'topic': 'Personal Care'},
      {'cluster': 2, 'topic': 'Footwear'},
      {'cluster': 3, 'topic': 'Food'},
      {'cluster': 4, 'topic': 'Electric Vehicles'}],
     ['topic: Home Appliances',
      'topic: Outdoor Equipment',
      'topic: Smart Home Technology',
      'topic: Fitness Equipment'])



And finally we can use this information to further prompt a model to keep generating synthetic data. We do this by passing all the topics in the list of jsons to the prompt below.


```python

  I am creating input output training pairs to fine tune my gpt model. I want the input to be product name and category and output to be description. the category should be things like: mobile phones, shoes, headphones, laptop, electronic toothbrush, etc. and also more importantly the categories should come under some main topics: {[entry['topic'] for entry in cluster_topic_mapping]})
  After the number of each example also state the topic area. The format should be of the form:
  1. topic_area
  Input: product_name, category
  Output: description

  Do not add any extra characters around that formatting as it will make the output parsing break.

  Here are some helpful examples so you get the style of output correct.

# Structured Data Extraction: Social Determinants of Health from Clinical Notes with Groq API's Json Mode

Since the dawn of the Electronic Health Record, deriving meaningful insights about the social determinants of health of a patient population has been the holy grail of healthcare analytics. While discrete clinical data (vitals, lab results, diagnoses, etc) is well understood, social determinants - things like financial insecurity, which can determine patient outcomes and barriers to care as much as the patient's clinical chart - are often hidden in clinical notes and unused by analytics departments. While some providers code social determinants using [Z codes](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/zcodes-infographic.pdf), these are often too inconsistently documented and many risk models seeking to add a social determinant score will simply default to using zip code as a crude proxy. With the emergence of Large Language Models, AI has the ability to extract and structure meaningful insights from free-text clinical notes at scale, enabling more effective patient outreach, better risk modeling and a more robust understanding of a patient population as a whole.

This notebook shows how we can use Groq API's [JSON mode](https://console.groq.com/docs/text-chat#json-mode-object-object) feature to extract social determinants of health from fake clinical notes, structure them into a neat table that can be used for analytics and load them into [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery). With JSON mode, we can return structured data from the chat completion in a pre-defined format, making it a great feature for structuring unstructrued data. We will read in each note, ask the LLM to determine if certain social determinant features are met, output structured data and load it into a database to be incorporated with the rest of our clinical data marts.

### Setup


```python
# Import packages
from groq import Groq
import pandas as pd
import os
from IPython.display import Markdown
import json
from google.cloud import bigquery
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

This code block loads in clinical notes from [our repository](https://github.com/groq/groq-api-cookbook/json-mode-social-determinants-of-health/clinical_notes) and displays the first note. As you can see, this hypothetical patient has quite a few notable social determinants of health that contribute to their health outcomes and treatment:


```python
# Define the directory path
folder_path = 'clinical_notes/'

# List all files in the directory
file_list = os.listdir(folder_path)
text_files = sorted([file for file in file_list if file.endswith('.txt')])

with open(os.path.join(folder_path, text_files[0]), 'r') as file:
    clinical_note = file.read()

display(Markdown(clinical_note))
```


**Date:** March 28, 2024

**Patient:** David Smith, 42 years old

**MRN:** 00456321

**Chief Complaint:** "I've been feeling really tired lately, more than usual."

**History of Present Illness:** The patient is a 42-year-old who presents with a 3-week history of increased fatigue, decreased energy, and occasional headaches. The patient reports struggling with sleep due to stress from work and personal life. The patient is currently working two part-time jobs but still finds it hard to make ends meet, indicating financial stress. They express concern over the cost of medications and healthcare visits.

**Past Medical History:** Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Hypertension

**Social History:**
The patient juggles two jobs to make ends meet, one at a local retail store and another in a fast-food chain, neither offering full-time hours or benefits. Despite the long hours, the patient mentions financial difficulties, especially with covering rent and providing. They share an apartment with three others in an area described as 'not the safest,' due to recent break-ins and a noticeable police presence. Meals are often missed or minimal, as the patient tries to stretch their budget, sometimes seeking help from local food banks when things get particularly tight.

Educationally, the patient completed high school but hasn't pursued further studies, citing lack of funds and the immediate need to support their family after graduation. They rely on buses and trains for transportation, which complicates timely access to healthcare, often causing delays or missed appointments. Socially, the patient admits to feeling isolated, with most of their family living out of state after their divorce and a personal life that has been 'on hold' due to work and financial pressures. They have a basic health insurance plan with high co-payments, which has led to skipping some recommended medical tests and treatments.

**Review of Systems:** Denies chest pain, shortness of breath, or fever. Reports occasional headaches.

**Physical Examination:**
- General: Appears tired but is alert and oriented.
- Vitals: BP 142/89, HR 78, Temp 98.6°F, Resp 16/min

**Assessment/Plan:**
- Continue to monitor blood pressure and diabetes control.
- Discuss affordable medication options with a pharmacist.
- Refer to a social worker to address food security, housing concerns, and access to healthcare services.
- Encourage the patient to engage with community support groups for social support.
- Schedule a follow-up appointment in 4 weeks or sooner if symptoms worsen.

**Comments:** The patient's health concerns are compounded by socioeconomic factors, including employment status, housing stability, food security, and access to healthcare. Addressing these social determinants of health is crucial for improving the patient's overall well-being.



### Define System and User Prompts

Crafting clear and effective prompts is crucial for generating valid LLM responses. In our case, we've defined the exact JSON schema for our social determinants of health table we expect the LLM to output and are including it in the system prompt. Then in the user prompt, we will include the entire clinical note in the context window.


```python
# Define system prompt (note: system prompt must contain "JSON" in it)
system_prompt = '''
You are a medical coding API specializing in social determinants of health that responds in JSON.
Your job is to extract structured SDOH data from an unstructured clinical note and output the structured data in JSON.
The JSON schema should include:
  {
    "employment_status": "string (categorical: 'Unemployed', 'Part-time', 'Full-time', 'Retired')",
    "financial_stress": "boolean (TRUE if the patient mentions financial difficulties)",
    "housing_insecurity": "boolean (TRUE if the patient does not live in stable housing conditions)",
    "neighborhood_unsafety": "boolean (TRUE if the patient expresses concerns about safety)",
    "food_insecurity": "boolean (TRUE if the patient does not have reliable access to sufficient food)",
    "education_level": "string (categorical: 'None', 'High School', 'College', 'Graduate')",
    "transportation_inaccessibility": "boolean (TRUE if the patient does not have reliable transportation to healthcare appointments)",
    "social_isolation": "boolean (TRUE if the patient mentions feeling isolated or having a lack of social support)",
    "health_insurance_inadequacy": (boolean: TRUE if the patient's health insurance is insufficient),
    "skipped_care_due_to_cost": "boolean (TRUE if the patient mentions skipping medical tests or treatments due to cost)",
    "marital_status": "string (categorical: 'Single', 'Married', 'Divorced', 'Widowed')",
    "language_barrier": "boolean (TRUE if the patient has language barriers to healthcare access)"
  }
'''
```


```python
# Define user prompt template
user_prompt_template = '''
Use information from following clinical note to construct the proper JSON output:

{clinical_note}
'''
```

### Executing Chat Completions with JSON Mode 

Now that we have our notes and our prompts, let's try running a Groq chat completion with JSON mode enabled on the first clinical note to see if the speedy ```llama3-8b-8192``` model can correctly identify this patient's social determinants. Note that you will need a Groq API Key to proceed and can create an account [here](https://console.groq.com/) to generate one for free:


```python
# Establish client with GROQ_API_KEY environment variable
client = Groq(api_key=os.getenv('GROQ_API_KEY'))
model = "llama3-8b-8192"

# Create chat completion object with JSON response format
chat_completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages = [
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": system_prompt
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": user_prompt_template.format(clinical_note=clinical_note),
        }
    ],
    model = model,
    response_format = {"type": "json_object"} # Add this response format to configure JSON mode
)

social_determinants_json_string = chat_completion.choices[0].message.content
print(social_determinants_json_string)
```

    {
      "employment_status": "Part-time",
      "financial_stress": true,
      "housing_insecurity": true,
      "neighborhood_unsafety": true,
      "food_insecurity": true,
      "education_level": "High School",
      "transportation_inaccessibility": true,
      "social_isolation": true,
      "health_insurance_inadequacy": true,
      "skipped_care_due_to_cost": true,
      "marital_status": "Divorced",
      "language_barrier": false
    }
    

Looks good! The patient does in fact work part time, is divorced and has expressed concerns pertaining their financial, housing and transportation situations, food insecurity, social isolation and healthcare costs. They do not have a language barrier.

Now, let's wrap this in a function and apply it to the rest of our clinical notes:


```python
def extract_sdoh_json(system_prompt,user_prompt,model):
    
    # Establish client with GROQ_API_KEY environment variable
    client = Groq(api_key=os.getenv('GROQ_API_KEY'))
    
    # Create chat completion object with JSON response format
    chat_completion = client.chat.completions.create(
        messages = [
            {
                "role": "system",
                "content": system_prompt
            },
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": user_prompt_template.format(clinical_note=clinical_note),
            }
        ],
        model = model,
        response_format = {"type": "json_object"} # Add this response format to configure JSON mode
    )
    
    social_determinants_json_string = chat_completion.choices[0].message.content

    # Return json object of the chat output
    return json.loads(social_determinants_json_string)
```


```python
# Total latency: 4s

model = "llama3-8b-8192"

patients_data = []
# Loop through each patient clinical note, extract structured SDOH and compile a list of JSON objects
for file_name in text_files:
    with open(os.path.join(folder_path, file_name), 'r') as file:
        clinical_note = file.read()
        user_prompt = user_prompt_template.format(clinical_note=clinical_note)
        social_determinants_json = extract_sdoh_json(system_prompt,user_prompt,model)
        social_determinants_json['mrn'] = file_name[:-4] # The name of the file is the patient's MRN 
        patients_data.append(social_determinants_json)

# Flatten the results into a dataframe
flattened_data = []
for patient in patients_data:
    flattened_data.append({'mrn': patient['mrn'],
                           'employment_status': patient['employment_status'],

Nice! In just 4 seconds we've parsed through five clinical notes, extracted discrete features and structured them into a neat table. That low latency is important for scaling up, and is why Groq's best-in-class speed makes it an ideal provider for this type of task - in a healthcare network with many providers, it would allow us to process clinical notes for 900 patients in an hour.

### Analyzing Structured Data

Now that our Social Determinants of Health are stored in a neat, structured format, we can analyze them much easier than when they're trapped in unstructured clinical notes. Here is a bar plot showing the percent of the patient population impacted by each social determinant - but with more data we could do far more advanced analyses such as showing which determinants are most correlated with each other, or which ones are most predictive of various chronic conditions or negative health outcomes:


```python
# Limit dataframe to boolean fields

### Loading to a Database

Finally, we will use [SQLAlchemy](https://pypi.org/project/SQLAlchemy/) to load the results to our database - in this case, a BigQuery dataset called ```clinical```. In a real production environment, we could use a tool like [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) to orchestrate the scheduling of this script and process any new notes from recent appointments. 


```python
# Append results to a pre-existing BigQuery table
client = bigquery.Client()
sdoh_df.to_gbq('clinical.social_determinants',client.project,credentials=client._credentials,if_exists='append')
```

### Conclusion

In this notebook, we've used Llama3 with Groq API's JSON mode to extract social determinants of health from and structure them in a relational table, then loaded the results into BigQuery where they can be combined and analyzed with the rest of our patient data. With our social determinants of health now structured in our clinical data warehouse, our analytics team can use it in countless ways by delivering much-needed SDOH insights and enhancing risk models. This allows the clinical practice to not just identify high-risk patients in their population, but to implement more targeted interventions by better understanding their barriers to care.

More broadly, we've shown how to use Groq to build an LLM-infused data pipeline, one that transforms unstructured text data into structured, relational data that can reside in a warehouse. And with Groq's low latency, the ability to process more files per minute makes for a more efficient pipeline.

## Overview

### Search
Vertex AI Search brings together the power of deep information retrieval, state-of-the-art natural language processing, and the latest in large language processing to understand user intent and return the most relevant results for the user.

With Vertex AI Search, you can create apps for searching and for making recommendations. Vertex AI Search also has special capabilities for some industries, such as media, healthcare, and retail.



### Gemini

Gemini is a family of generative AI models developed by Google DeepMind that is designed for multimodal use cases. The Gemini API gives you access to the Gemini Pro and Gemini Pro Vision models.

### Gemini API in Vertex AI

The Gemini API in Vertex AI provides a unified interface for interacting with Gemini models.

You can interact with the Gemini API using the following methods:

- Use [Vertex AI Studio](https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-studio) for quick testing and command generation
- Use cURL commands
- Use the Vertex AI SDK

For more information, see the [Generative AI on Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/learn/overview) documentation.

This tutorial explains how to call a search app with mixed datastore, get search snippets and summarize the response using Gemini Pro. 


### Create a Search App with Mixed Datastores

1. Follow the steps listed here to create a Search App
   - https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/create-engine-es 
2. Create the relevant data stores (GCS, BQ, Website)
   - https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/create-data-store-es
3. Link the data stores to the Search App
   - https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/create-data-store-es#multi-data-stores

The example query and results are based on the data used in this tutorial:
   - https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/try-enterprise-search

### Install the Relevant packages


```
%pip install --upgrade --user -q google-cloud-aiplatform google-cloud-discoveryengine
```

### Restart current runtime

To use the newly installed packages in this Jupyter runtime, you must restart the runtime. You can do this by running the cell below, which will restart the current kernel.


```
# Restart kernel after installs so that your environment can access the new packages
import IPython

app = IPython.Application.instance()
app.kernel.do_shutdown(True)
```

### Authenticate your notebook environment (Colab only)

If you are running this notebook on Google Colab, run the following cell to authenticate your environment. This step is not required if you are using [Vertex AI Workbench](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai-workbench).



```
import sys

# Additional authentication is required for Google Colab
if "google.colab" in sys.modules:
    # Authenticate user to Google Cloud
    from google.colab import auth

    auth.authenticate_user()
```

### Define Google Cloud project information


```
PROJECT_ID = "PROJECT_ID"  # @param {type:"string"}
SEARCH_APP_LOCATION = "global"  # @param {type:"string"}
SEARCH_ENGINE_ID = "VERTEX_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID"  # @param {type:"string"}
LOCATION_GEMINI_MODEL = "us-central1"  # @param {type:"string"}
```

### Initialize the Vertex AI SDK


```
import vertexai

vertexai.init(project=PROJECT_ID, location=LOCATION_GEMINI_MODEL)
```

### Import the Relevant packages


```
import re

from google.api_core.client_options import ClientOptions
from google.cloud import discoveryengine_v1alpha as discoveryengine
from vertexai.generative_models import (
    GenerationConfig,
    GenerativeModel,
    HarmBlockThreshold,
    HarmCategory,
)
```

### Send a Request to Vertex AI Search App with Data Blending (Mixed Datastore) 

- https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/create-data-store-es#multi-data-stores


```
search_query = "What was Google's revenue in Q4 2020?"
```


```
# Create a client using a regional endpoint
client = discoveryengine.SearchServiceClient(
    client_options=(
        ClientOptions(
            api_endpoint=f"{SEARCH_APP_LOCATION}-discoveryengine.googleapis.com"
        )
        if SEARCH_APP_LOCATION != "global"
        else None
    )
)

# The full resource name of the search app serving config
serving_config = f"projects/{PROJECT_ID}/locations/{SEARCH_APP_LOCATION}/collections/default_collection/engines/{SEARCH_ENGINE_ID}/servingConfigs/default_config"

response = client.search(
    discoveryengine.SearchRequest(
        serving_config=serving_config,
        query=search_query,
        page_size=10,
    )
)
```

### Extract & clean up snippets from search results



```
retrieved_data: list[str] = []

for result in response.results:
    data = result.document.derived_struct_data
    if not data:
        continue

    snippets: list[str] = [
        re.sub("<[^>]*>", "", snippet_item.get("snippet", ""))
        for snippet_item in data.get("snippets", [])
        if snippet_item.get("snippet")
    ]

    extractive_answers: list[str] = [
        re.sub("<[^>]*>", "", snippet_item.get("content", ""))
        for snippet_item in data.get("extractive_answers", [])
        if snippet_item.get("content")
    ]

    if snippets:
        title = data.get("title", "Unknown Title")
        retrieved_data.append(
            f"--- Snippets from Document {title} ---\n{''.join(snippets)}\n"
        )
    elif extractive_answers:
        title = data.get("link", "Unknown")
        retrieved_data.append(
            f"--- Snippets from Document {title} ---\n{''.join(extractive_answers)}\n"
        )
```

### Feed the Search result snippets to Gemini Pro model and formulate a summary/response based on your original prompt

#### Model parameters

Every prompt you send to the model includes parameter values that control how the model generates a response.

The model can generate different results for different parameter values.

You can experiment with different model parameters to see how the results change.



```
generation_config = GenerationConfig(
    temperature=0,
    top_p=1.0,
    max_output_tokens=2048,
)
```


```
# Prompt for Gemini Pro model
PROMPT_GEMINI = f"""Provide an answer to the question based on the information in the Document snippets provided with citations.
Question: {search_query}
{''.join(retrieved_data)}
"""

model = GenerativeModel("gemini-1.5-pro")  # specify the Gemini model version


def generate(PROMPT_GEMINI: str):
    """
    Given the prompt
    output the summarized response to user's original query
    """
    responses = model.generate_content(
        PROMPT_GEMINI,
        generation_config=generation_config,
        safety_settings={
            HarmCategory.HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH: HarmBlockThreshold.BLOCK_MEDIUM_AND_ABOVE,
            HarmCategory.HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT: HarmBlockThreshold.BLOCK_MEDIUM_AND_ABOVE,
            HarmCategory.HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT: HarmBlockThreshold.BLOCK_MEDIUM_AND_ABOVE,
            HarmCategory.HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT: HarmBlockThreshold.BLOCK_MEDIUM_AND_ABOVE,
        },
        stream=True,
    )

    for response in responses:
        print(response.text, end="")


print(f"PROMPT:\n{PROMPT_GEMINI}")

print("Gemini Response:\n")
generate(PROMPT_GEMINI)
```

    PROMPT:
    Provide an answer to the question based on the information in the Document snippets provided with citations.

## Objective

This notebook shows how to use [filters and metadata](https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/filter-search-metadata) in search requests to [Vertex AI Search](https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/introduction).

This works with unstructured apps that contain metadata. You can use metadata fields to restrict your search to a specific set of documents.


Services used in the notebook:

- ✅ Vertex AI Search for document search and retrieval

## Install pre-requisites

If running in Colab install the pre-requisites into the runtime. Otherwise it is assumed that the notebook is running in Vertex AI Workbench. In that case it is recommended to install the pre-requisites from a terminal using the `--user` option.



```
%pip install -q google-cloud-discoveryengine==0.11.2 --upgrade --user
```

    
    [1m[[0m[34;49mnotice[0m[1;39;49m][0m[39;49m A new release of pip is available: [0m[31;49m23.2.1[0m[39;49m -> [0m[32;49m23.3[0m
    [1m[[0m[34;49mnotice[0m[1;39;49m][0m[39;49m To update, run: [0m[32;49mpython3.11 -m pip install --upgrade pip[0m
    Note: you may need to restart the kernel to use updated packages.
    

### Restart current runtime

To use the newly installed packages in this Jupyter runtime, you must restart the runtime. You can do this by running the cell below, which will restart the current kernel.


```
# Restart kernel after installs so that your environment can access the new packages

import IPython

app = IPython.Application.instance()
app.kernel.do_shutdown(True)
```




    {'status': 'ok', 'restart': True}



<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning">
<b>⚠️ The kernel is going to restart. Please wait until it is finished before continuing to the next step. ⚠️</b>
</div>


## Authenticate

If running in Colab authenticate with `google.colab.google.auth` otherwise assume that running on Vertex AI Workbench.



```
import sys

if "google.colab" in sys.modules:
    from google.colab import auth as google_auth

    google_auth.authenticate_user()

from google.auth import default

creds, _ = default()
```

## Configure notebook environment


## Data store metadata

Metadata for the data store `<DATA_STORE_ID>` looks like this:

```json
{
  "id": "1",
  "structData": {
    "title": "Document1",
    "category": [
      "PersonaA"
    ],
    "name": "Document1"
  },
  "content": {
    "mimeType": "application/pdf",
    "uri": "gs://<BUCKETNAME>/data/Document1"
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "id": "2",
  "structData": {
    "title": "Document2",
    "category": [
      "PersonaA",
      "PersonaB"
    ],
    "name": "Document2"
  },
  "content": {
    "mimeType": "application/pdf",
    "uri": "gs://<BUCKETNAME>/data/Document2"
  }
}
```

### Set the following constants to reflect your environment


```
PROJECT_ID = "<PROJECT_ID>"
LOCATION = "global"  # Replace with your data store location
DATA_STORE_ID = "<DATA_STORE_ID>"
```

### REST API examples

The filter `name: ANY("Document1")` ensures the query is against only the documents with `name` matching `Document1`.


```bash
%%bash -s "$PROJECT_ID" "$LOCATION" "$DATA_STORE_ID"

project_id=$1
location=$2
data_store_id=$3

curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
"https://discoveryengine.googleapis.com/v1beta/projects/$project_id/locations/$location/collections/default_collection/dataStores/$data_store_id/servingConfigs/default_search:search" \
-d '{
"query": "claim",
"filter": "name: ANY(\"Document1\")"
}'

```

The filter `category: ANY("PersonaB")` ensures the query is against only the documents with `name` matching `Document1`.


```bash
%%bash -s "$PROJECT_ID" "$LOCATION" "$DATA_STORE_ID"

project_id=$1
location=$2
data_store_id=$3

curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
"https://discoveryengine.googleapis.com/v1beta/projects/$project_id/locations/$location/collections/default_collection/dataStores/$data_store_id/servingConfigs/default_search:search" \
-d '{
"query": "claims",
"filter": "category: ANY(\"PersonaB\")"
}'

```

print("Summary" + "-" * 40)
print(results.summary.summary_text)

```

Here is a slightly more complex filter based on 2 metadata values


```
search_query = "how to process a claim"
filter_str = 'name: ANY("Document1") AND category: ANY("PersonaA")'

results = search_data_store(
    PROJECT_ID, LOCATION, DATA_STORE_ID, search_query, filter_str
)

print(f"\nQuestion: '{search_query}'\n\n")
print("Summary" + "-" * 40)
print(results.summary.summary_text)

print("Raw Results" + "-" * 40)
print(results)
```

### Authentication

To run this notebook, your API key must be stored it in a Colab Secret named GOOGLE_API_KEY. If you are running in a different environment, you can store your key in an environment variable. See [Authentication](../../quickstarts/Authentication.ipynb) to learn more.

This first cell is in python, just to copy your API key to an environment variable, so you can access it from the shell:


```
import os
from google.colab import userdata
os.environ['GOOGLE_API_KEY'] = userdata.get('GOOGLE_API_KEY')
```

## Call the api

Call search grounding. The `dynamic_threshold` is optional, it sets how likely the model is to do a google-search.


```bash
%%bash
curl "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-flash:generateContent?key=$GOOGLE_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

              ]
          }
      ],

Use `jq` to colorize the output, and make it easier to explore.


```
!sudo apt install -q jq
```

Here's all the output:


```
!jq "" -r result.json
```

Here is the text response:


```
!jq -r ".candidates[0].content.parts[0].text" result.json
```

Here is the `groundingMetadata`, including links to any supports used:


```
!jq -r ".candidates[0].groundingMetadata" result.json

This notebook demonstrates the use of embeddings to re-rank search results. This walkthrough will focus on the following objectives:



1.   Setting up your development environment and API access to use Gemini.
2.   Using Gemini's function calling support to access the Wikipedia API.
3.   Embedding content via Gemini API.
4.   Re-ranking the search results.


This is how you will implement search re-ranking:


1.   The user will make a search query.
2.   You will use Wikipedia API to return the relevant search results.
3.   The search results will be embedded and their relevance will be evaluated by calculating distance metrics like cosine similarity.
4.   The most relevant search result will be returned as the final answer.

## Setup



```
!pip install -q -U "google-generativeai>=0.7.2"
```


```
!pip install -q wikipedia
```

Note: The [`wikipedia` package](https://pypi.org/project/wikipedia/) notes that it was "designed for ease of use and simplicity, not for advanced use", and that production or heavy use should instead "use [Pywikipediabot](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Pywikipediabot) or one of the other more advanced [Python MediaWiki API wrappers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Creating_a_bot#Python)".


```
import json
import textwrap

import google.generativeai as genai

import wikipedia
from wikipedia.exceptions import DisambiguationError, PageError

import numpy as np

from IPython.display import Markdown

def to_markdown(text):
  text = text.replace('•', '  *')
  return Markdown(textwrap.indent(text, '> ', predicate=lambda _: True))
```

To run the following cell, your API key must be stored it in a Colab Secret named `GOOGLE_API_KEY`. If you don't already have an API key, or you're not sure how to create a Colab Secret, see the [Authentication](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Authentication.ipynb) quickstart for an example.


```
from google.colab import userdata
GOOGLE_API_KEY=userdata.get('GOOGLE_API_KEY')
genai.configure(api_key=GOOGLE_API_KEY)
```

## Define tools

As stated earlier, this tutorial uses Gemini's function calling support to access the Wikipedia API. Please refer to the [docs](https://ai.google.dev/docs/function_calling) to learn more about function calling.

### Define the search function

To cater to the search engine needs, you will design this function in the following way:


*   For each search query, the search engine will use the `wikipedia.search` method to get relevant topics.
*   From the relevant topics, the engine will choose `n_topics(int)` top candidates and will use `gemini-1.5-flash` to extract relevant information from the page.
*   The engine will avoid duplicate entries by maintaining a search history.



```
def wikipedia_search(search_queries: list[str]) -> list[str]:
  """Search wikipedia for each query and summarize relevant docs."""
  n_topics=3
  search_history = set() # tracking search history
  search_urls = []
  mining_model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash')
  summary_results = []

  for query in search_queries:
    print(f'Searching for "{query}"')
    search_terms = wikipedia.search(query)

    print(f"Related search terms: {search_terms[:n_topics]}")
    for search_term in search_terms[:n_topics]: # select first `n_topics` candidates
      if search_term in search_history: # check if the topic is already covered
        continue

      print(f'Fetching page: "{search_term}"')
      search_history.add(search_term) # add to search history

      try:
        # extract the relevant data by using `gemini-1.5-flash` model
        page = wikipedia.page(search_term, auto_suggest=False)

> ## Relevant information about LLMs from the source:
> 
> * **LLMs are described as "stochastic parrots"**: This means they can generate plausible language but lack understanding of the meaning of the words they process.
> * **The term was coined in 2021**:  By Emily Bender, Timnit Gebru, Angelina McMillan-Major, and Margaret Mitchell in their paper "On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big?" 🦜.
> * **LLMs have limitations**: They are limited by the data they are trained on and may produce dangerous outputs due to biases or limitations in the training data.
> * **LLMs don't understand the meaning of language**: They only statistically link words and sentences together, unable to differentiate facts and fiction.
> * **The debate about LLMs understanding is ongoing**: While some researchers argue LLMs are merely pattern matchers, others believe they are capable of understanding language.
> * **LLMs' performance on benchmarks and experiments is contested**: Some argue their performance proves understanding, while others say they are exploiting shortcuts and correlations within the data.
> * **The "stochastic parrot" concept is widely used**: It's a popular term among AI skeptics and has been adopted by some AI professionals to describe LLMs' limitations.

### Pass the tools to the model

If you pass a list of functions to the `GenerativeModel`'s `tools` argument,
it will extract a schema from the function's signature and type hints, and then pass schema along to the API calls. In response the model may return a `FunctionCall` object asking to call the function.

Note: This approach only handles annotations of `AllowedTypes = int | float | str | dict | list['AllowedTypes']`

The `GenerativeModel` will keep a reference to the function inself, so that it _can_ execute the function locally later.


```
model = genai.GenerativeModel(
    'gemini-1.5-flash',
    tools=[wikipedia_search],
    generation_config={'temperature': 0.6})
```

## Generate supporting search queries

In order to have multiple supporting search queries to the user's original query, you will ask the model to generate more such queries. This would help the engine to cover the asked question on comprehensive levels.


```
instructions = """You have access to the Wikipedia API which you will be using
to answer a user's query. Your job is to generate a list of search queries which
might answer a user's question. Be creative by using various key-phrases from
the user's query. To generate variety of queries, ask questions which are
related to  the user's query that might help to find the answer. The more
queries you generate the better are the odds of you finding the correct answer.
Here is an example:

user: Tell me about Cricket World cup 2023 winners.

function_call: wikipedia_search(['What is the name of the team that
won the Cricket World Cup 2023?', 'Who was the captain of the Cricket World Cup
2023 winning team?', 'Which country hosted the Cricket World Cup 2023?', 'What
was the venue of the Cricket World Cup 2023 final match?', 'Cricket World cup 2023',
'Who lifted the Cricket World Cup 2023 trophy?'])

The search function will return a list of article summaries, use these to
answer the  user's question.

Here is the user's query: {query}
"""
```

In order to yield creative and a more random variety of questions, you will set the model's temperature parameter to a value higher. Values can range from [0.0,1.0], inclusive. A value closer to 1.0 will produce responses that are more varied and creative, while a value closer to 0.0 will typically result in more straightforward responses from the model.

## Enable automatic function calling and call the API

Now start a new chat with `enable_automatic_function_calling=True`. With it enabled, the `genai.ChatSession` will handle the back and forth required to call the function, and return the final response:


```
model = genai.GenerativeModel(
    'gemini-1.5-flash', tools=[wikipedia_search], generation_config={'temperature': 0.6})

chat = model.start_chat(enable_automatic_function_calling=True)

query = "Explain how deep-sea life survives."

res = chat.send_message(instructions.format(query=query))

> Deep-sea life faces unique challenges due to the extreme environment. Here's how they survive:
> 
> * **Food Scarcity:**  The deep sea has limited food sources. Creatures rely on marine snow (sinking organic matter), whale falls (dead whale carcasses), and chemosynthesis (using chemicals from hydrothermal vents or cold seeps for energy).
> * **Pressure:** Deep-sea animals have evolved to withstand immense pressure. They have small sizes, gelatinous flesh, minimal skeletal structure, and lack internal cavities that could collapse.
> * **Darkness:**  The lack of sunlight has led to adaptations like large eyes for visual hunting and communication, bioluminescence for camouflage, and vertical migrations for food in the twilight zone. In the midnight zone, organisms have reduced or absent organs, relying on detritus for food. 
> * **Temperature:**  While generally cold and stable, deep-sea temperatures vary near hydrothermal vents, where extreme changes occur.
> * **Salinity:**  Deep-sea salinity is generally constant, except in areas like the Mediterranean Sea and brine pools.
> 
> Deep-sea creatures have evolved remarkable adaptations to thrive in this challenging environment.

            "## Relevant Information about Deep-Sea Creature Survival:\n\n**Energy Sources:**\n\n* **Marine Snow:**  Deep-sea organisms rely on organic matter (POM) that sinks from the surface, often repackaged into larger, faster-sinking particles known as \"marine snow.\"\n* **Whale Falls:** The death of a whale provides a significant influx of organic matter, supporting a unique ecosystem through different stages: mobile scavengers, opportunistic colonizers, and sulfide-loving creatures.\n* **Chemosynthesis:** \n    * **Hydrothermal Vents:**  Bacteria utilize chemicals from these vents to produce energy, supporting a diverse ecosystem independent from sunlight.\n    * **Cold Seeps:** Similar to hydrothermal vents, these areas release chemicals that fuel chemosynthetic bacteria, creating a specialized ecosystem.\n\n**Adaptations to the Deep Sea Environment:**\n\n* **Pressure:** Deep-sea creatures have evolved to survive immense pressure, with adaptations such as small size, gelatinous flesh, minimal skeletal structure, and the absence of internal cavities that could collapse.\n* **Darkness:**  Organisms in the aphotic zone (perpetual darkness) have adapted to lack of light:\n    * **Mesopelagic zone (Twilight zone):**  Large eyes for visual hunting and communication, bioluminescence for camouflage, and vertical migrations for food.\n    * **Bathyal zone (Midnight zone):**  Reduced or absent organs, slimy skin, weak skeletal structure, and reliance on detritus for food.\n* **Temperature:**  The deep sea is generally cold and stable, except near hydrothermal vents, where extreme temperature changes occur.\n* **Salinity:** Salinity is generally constant in the deep sea, with notable exceptions like the Mediterranean Sea and brine pools.\n\n**Challenges to Deep Sea Research:**\n\n* **Extreme Pressure:** The significant difference in pressure between the seafloor and the surface makes it difficult to bring deep-sea creatures to the surface alive for study.\n* **Limited Exploration:**  Only a small percentage of the ocean floor has been explored.\n\n**Research Innovations:**\n\n* **Pressurized Fish Traps:**  Designed to slowly adjust the internal pressure of captured creatures as they are brought to the surface.\n* **PERISCOP:**  A capture device that maintains water pressure during ascent, keeping samples in a pressurized environment for study. \n\n\nBased on:\n  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep-sea_community",

            "Deep-sea animals get food in a variety of ways, depending on their location and the availability of resources. Here's a breakdown of some key methods:\n\n* **Filter Feeding:** Many deep-sea animals, like sponges, filter food particles out of the water using specialized structures. They may use cilia to create currents, trapping small organisms like plankton, bacteria, and detritus. \n* **Predation:** Some deep-sea creatures are predators, hunting and consuming other animals. These animals may use bioluminescence to attract prey, or have specialized adaptations like sharp teeth or venomous stings.\n* **Scavenging:** Scavengers, such as some fish and invertebrates, feed on dead animals and decaying organic matter. This is especially important in the deep sea, where food is scarce.\n* **Symbiosis:** Some deep-sea organisms form symbiotic relationships with other creatures. For example, some fish live in close association with hydrothermal vents and rely on chemosynthetic bacteria for food. \n* **Chemosynthesis:**  In areas with limited sunlight, like hydrothermal vents and cold seeps, some bacteria use chemosynthesis to create food. They obtain energy from the oxidation of inorganic compounds, like hydrogen sulfide, and provide a food source for other animals. \n\n\nBased on:\n  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_life",

The ocean is a vast ecosystem with a complex food web, with primary producers at the bottom and apex predators at the top.  Primary producers like algae, plants, bacteria, and protists acquire energy from sunlight through photosynthesis.  Herbivores, known as primary consumers, eat these plants, and carnivores, known as secondary consumers, eat the herbivores.  Some organisms are omnivores and eat both plants and animals.

These plumes increase water turbidity (cloudiness) and can harm filter-feeding organisms and impact the food web.\n* **Benthic Disturbance:**  Removing parts of the seafloor disrupts the habitat of benthic organisms, potentially causing significant damage to fragile deep-sea ecosystems.\n* **Noise and Light Pollution:**  Deep-sea mining generates noise and light pollution that can negatively impact marine life. This includes behavioral changes, communication difficulties, and hearing damage in fish and marine mammals. \n\n**Impact on Deep-Sea Organisms:**\n\n* **Polymetallic nodule fields** are hotspots of abundance and diversity for abyssal fauna. Mining these fields can destroy crucial habitats and impact biodiversity.\n* **Sediment plumes** can clog filter-feeding organisms such as manta rays.\n* **Light and turbidity** inhibit growth of photosynthesizing organisms, including coral and phytoplankton, which are at the bottom of the food chain. This can reduce food availability for other organisms.\n* **Metals** carried by plumes can accumulate in tissues of shellfish and work their way through the food web, impacting predators, including humans.\n\n**Studies Highlight Concern:**\n\n*  Researchers have identified **over 1,000 species, 90% previously unknown, with over 50% dependent on polymetallic nodules for survival**, highlighting the vulnerability of these ecosystems.\n*  While some reports claim that biomass loss from deep-sea mining is smaller than that from land mining, others suggest that deep-sea mining would be **approximately 25 times worse for biodiversity** than land mining.\n\n**Recovery Time:**\n\n*  Preliminary studies indicate that the **seabed requires decades to recover** from even minor disturbances, raising concerns about the long-term impact of deep-sea mining.\n\n**Need for Further Research:**\n\n*  Deep-sea mining has yet to receive a **comprehensive evaluation of its environmental impacts**. More research is urgently needed to fully understand the potential risks to deep-sea ecosystems. \n\n\nBased on:\n  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_sea_mining"

They have small sizes, gelatinous flesh, minimal skeletal structure, and lack internal cavities that could collapse.\n* **Darkness:**  The lack of sunlight has led to adaptations like large eyes for visual hunting and communication, bioluminescence for camouflage, and vertical migrations for food in the twilight zone. In the midnight zone, organisms have reduced or absent organs, relying on detritus for food. \n* **Temperature:**  While generally cold and stable, deep-sea temperatures vary near hydrothermal vents, where extreme changes occur.\n* **Salinity:**  Deep-sea salinity is generally constant, except in areas like the Mediterranean Sea and brine pools.\n\nDeep-sea creatures have evolved remarkable adaptations to thrive in this challenging environment. \n"

## Re-ranking the search results

Helper function to embed the content:


```
def get_embeddings(content: list[str]) -> np.ndarray:
  embeddings = genai.embed_content('models/embedding-001', content, 'SEMANTIC_SIMILARITY')
  embds = embeddings.get('embedding', None)
  embds = np.array(embds).reshape(len(embds), -1)
  return embds
```

Please refer to the [embeddings guide](https://ai.google.dev/docs/embeddings_guide) for more information on embeddings.

Your next step is to define functions that you can use to calculate similarity scores between two embedding vectors. These scores will help you decide which embedding vector is the most relevant vector to the user's query.


You will now implement cosine similarity as your metric. Here returned embedding vectors will be of unit length and hence their L1 norm (`np.linalg.norm()`) will be ~1. Hence, calculating cosine similarity is esentially same as calculating their dot product score.


```
def dot_product(a: np.ndarray, b: np.ndarray):
  return (a @ b.T)

# Search reranking with cross-encoders

This notebook takes you through examples of using a cross-encoder to re-rank search results.

This is a common use case with our customers, where you've implemented semantic search using embeddings (produced using a [bi-encoder](https://www.sbert.net/examples/applications/retrieve_rerank/README.html#retrieval-bi-encoder)) but the results are not as accurate as your use case requires. A possible cause is that there is some business rule you can use to rerank the documents such as how recent or how popular a document is. 

However, often there are subtle domain-specific rules that help determine relevancy, and this is where a cross-encoder can be useful. Cross-encoders are more accurate than bi-encoders but they don't scale well, so using them to re-order a shortened list returned by semantic search is the ideal use case.

### Example

Consider a search task with D documents and Q queries.

The brute force approach of computing every pairwise relevance is expensive; its cost scales as ```D * Q```. This is known as **cross-encoding**.

A faster approach is **embeddings-based search**, in which an embedding is computed once for each document and query, and then re-used multiple times to cheaply compute pairwise relevance. Because embeddings are only computed once, its cost scales as ```D + Q```. This is known as **bi-encoding**.

Although embeddings-based search is faster, the quality can be worse. To get the best of both, one common approach is to use embeddings (or another bi-encoder) to cheaply identify top candidates, and then use GPT (or another cross-encoder) to expensively re-rank those top candidates. The cost of this hybrid approach scales as ```(D + Q) * cost of embedding + (N * Q) * cost of re-ranking```, where ```N``` is the number of candidates re-ranked.

### Walkthrough

To illustrate this approach we'll use ```text-davinci-003``` with ```logprobs``` enabled to build a GPT-powered cross-encoder. Our GPT models have strong general language understanding, which when tuned with some few-shot examples can provide a simple and effective cross-encoding option.

This notebook drew on this great [article](https://weaviate.io/blog/cross-encoders-as-reranker) by Weaviate, and this [excellent explanation](https://www.sbert.net/examples/applications/cross-encoder/README.html) of bi-encoders vs. cross-encoders from Sentence Transformers.

## Cross-encoder

We'll create a cross-encoder using the ```Completions``` endpoint - the key factors to consider here are:
- Make your examples domain-specific - the strength of cross-encoders comes when you tailor them to your domain.
- There is a trade-off between how many potential examples to re-rank vs. processing speed. Consider batching and parallel processing cross-encoder requests to process them more quickly.

The steps here are:
- Build a prompt to assess relevance and provide few-shot examples to tune it to your domain.
- Add a ```logit bias``` for the tokens for ``` Yes``` and ``` No``` to decrease the likelihood of any other tokens occurring.
- Return the classification of yes/no as well as the ```logprobs```.
- Rerank the results by the ```logprobs``` keyed on ``` Yes```.


```python
tokens = [" Yes", " No"]
tokenizer = tiktoken.encoding_for_model(OPENAI_MODEL)
ids = [tokenizer.encode(token) for token in tokens]
ids[0], ids[1]
```

Unless situated in sufficiently (re)ionised regions, Lyman-α emission from these galaxies would be strongly absorbed by neutral gas in the intergalactic medium (IGM). We conservatively estimate sizes of the ionised regions required to reconcile the relatively low Lyman-α velocity offsets (ΔvLyα<300kms−1) with moderately high Lyman-α escape fractions (fesc,Lyα>5%) observed in our sample of LAEs, indicating the presence of ionised ``bubbles'' with physical sizes of the order of 0.1pMpc≲Rion≲1pMpc in a patchy reionisation scenario where the bubbles are embedded in a fully neutral IGM. Around half of the LAEs in our sample are found to coincide with large-scale galaxy overdensities seen in FRESCO at z∼5.8-5.9 and z∼7.3, suggesting Lyman-α transmission is strongly enhanced in such overdense regions, and underlining the importance of LAEs as tracers of the first large-scale ionised bubbles. Considering only spectroscopically confirmed galaxies, we find our sample of UV-faint LAEs (MUV≳−20mag) and their direct neighbours are generally not able to produce the required ionised regions based on the Lyman-α transmission properties, suggesting lower-luminosity sources likely play an important role in carving out these bubbles.

    'In Search for Linear Relations in Sentence Embedding Spaces: We present an introductory investigation into continuous-space vector\nrepresentations of sentences. We acquire pairs of very similar sentences\ndiffering only by a small alterations (such as change of a noun, adding an\nadjective, noun or punctuation) from datasets for natural language inference\nusing a simple pattern method. We look into how such a small change within the\nsentence text affects its representation in the continuous space and how such\nalterations are reflected by some of the popular sentence embedding models. We\nfound that vector differences of some embeddings actually reflect small changes\nwithin a sentence.'



## Conclusion

We've shown how to create a tailored cross-encoder to rerank academic papers. This approach will work best where there are domain-specific nuances that can be used to pick the most relevant corpus for your users, and where some pre-filtering has taken place to limit the amount of data the cross-encoder will need to process. 

A few typical use cases we've seen are:
- Returning a list of 100 most relevant stock reports, then re-ordering into a top 5 or 10 based on the detailed context of a particular set of customer portfolios
- Running after a classic rules-based search that gets the top 100 or 1000 most relevant results to prune it according to a specific user's context


### Taking this forward

Taking the few-shot approach, as we have here, can work well when the domain is general enough that a small number of examples will cover most reranking cases. However, as the differences between documents become more specific you may want to consider the ```Fine-tuning``` endpoint to make a more elaborate cross-encoder with a wider variety of examples.

There is also a latency impact of using ```text-davinci-003``` that you'll need to consider, with even our few examples above taking a couple seconds each - again, the ```Fine-tuning``` endpoint may help you here if you are able to get decent results from an ```ada``` or ```babbage``` fine-tuned model.

We've used the ```Completions``` endpoint from OpenAI to build our cross-encoder, but this area is well-served by the open-source community. [Here](https://huggingface.co/jeffwan/mmarco-mMiniLMv2-L12-H384-v1) is an example from HuggingFace, for example.

We hope you find this useful for tuning your search use cases, and look forward to seeing what you build.

# Search and Summarize: AI-Powered Web Research Tool

## Overview
This Jupyter notebook implements an intelligent web research assistant that combines web search capabilities with AI-powered summarization. It automates the process of gathering information from the internet and distilling it into concise, relevant summaries, enhancing the efficiency of online research tasks.

## Motivation
In the age of information overload, efficiently extracting relevant knowledge from the vast expanse of the internet is increasingly challenging. This tool addresses several key pain points:

1. Time consumption in manual web searches
2. Information overload from multiple sources
3. Difficulty in quickly grasping key points from lengthy articles
4. Need for focused research on specific websites

By automating the search and summarization process, this tool aims to significantly reduce the time and cognitive load associated with web research, allowing users to quickly gain insights on any topic.

## Key Components
The notebook consists of several integral components:

1. **Web Search Module**: Utilizes DuckDuckGo's search API to fetch relevant web pages based on user queries.
2. **Result Parser**: Processes raw search results into a structured format for further analysis.
3. **Text Summarization Engine**: Leverages OpenAI's language models to generate concise summaries of web content.
4. **Integration Layer**: Combines the search and summarization functionalities into a seamless workflow.

## Method Details

### Web Search Process
1. The user provides a search query and optionally specifies a target website.
2. If a specific site is given, the tool performs two searches:
   a. A site-specific search within the specified domain
   b. A general search excluding the specified site
3. Without a specific site, it conducts a general web search.
4. Search results are parsed to extract snippets, titles, and links.

### Summarization Approach
1. For each search result, the tool extracts the relevant text content.
2. The extracted text is sent to the AI model with a prompt requesting a concise summary.
3. The AI generates a summary in the form of 1-2 bullet points, capturing the key information.
4. Summaries are compiled along with their sources (title and link).

### Integration and Output
1. The tool combines the web search and summarization processes into a single function call.
2. It returns a formatted output containing summaries from multiple sources, each clearly attributed.
3. The output is designed to provide a quick overview of the topic, with links to full sources for further reading.

## Conclusion
This notebook demonstrates the power of combining web search capabilities with AI-driven summarization. It offers a practical solution for rapid information gathering and synthesis, applicable in various domains such as research, journalism, business intelligence, and general knowledge acquisition. By automating the tedious aspects of web research, it allows users to focus on higher-level analysis and decision-making based on quickly acquired, relevant information.

The modular design of this tool also allows for future enhancements, such as integration with different search engines, implementation of more advanced summarization techniques, or adaptation to specific domain knowledge requirements.

In this walkthrough, you will learn how to:


1.   Set up your development environment and API access to use Gemini.
2.   Use a ReAct few-shot prompt.
3.   Use the newly prompted model for multi-turn conversations (chat).
4.   Connect the model to the **Wikipedia API**.
5.  Have conversations with the model (try asking it questions like "how tall is the Eiffel Tower?") and watch it search Wikipedia.

### Background

  


[ReAct](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629) is a prompting method which allows language models to create a trace of their thinking processes and the steps required to answer a user's questions. This improves human interpretability and trustworthiness. ReAct prompted models generate Thought-Action-Observation triplets for every iteration, as you'll soon see. Let's get started!

## Setup



```
!pip install -q "google-generativeai>=0.7.2"
```


```
!pip install -q wikipedia
```

Note: The [`wikipedia` package](https://pypi.org/project/wikipedia/) notes that it was "designed for ease of use and simplicity, not for advanced use", and that production or heavy use should instead "use [Pywikipediabot](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Pywikipediabot) or one of the other more advanced [Python MediaWiki API wrappers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Creating_a_bot#Python)".


```
import re
import os

import wikipedia
from wikipedia.exceptions import DisambiguationError, PageError

import google.generativeai as genai
```

To run the following cell, your API key must be stored it in a Colab Secret named `GOOGLE_API_KEY`. If you don't already have an API key, or you're not sure how to create a Colab Secret, see the [Authentication](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Authentication.ipynb) quickstart for an example.


```
from google.colab import userdata
GOOGLE_API_KEY=userdata.get('GOOGLE_API_KEY')
genai.configure(api_key=GOOGLE_API_KEY)
```

## The ReAct prompt

The prompts used in the paper are available at [https://github.com/ysymyth/ReAct/tree/master/prompts](https://github.com/ysymyth/ReAct/tree/master/prompts)

Here, you will be working with the following ReAct prompt with a few minor adjustments.

> Note: The prompt and in-context examples used here are borrowed from [https://github.com/ysymyth/ReAct](https://github.com/ysymyth/ReAct) which is published under a [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).


```
model_instructions = """Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Action, Observation steps. Thought can reason about the current situation, Observation is understanding relevant information from an Action's output and Action can be of three types:
(1) <search>entity</search>, which searches the exact entity on Wikipedia and returns the first paragraph if it exists. If not, it will return some similar entities to search and you can try to search the information from those topics.
(2) <lookup>keyword</lookup>, which returns the next sentence containing keyword in the current context. This only does exact matches, so keep your searches short.
(3) <finish>answer</finish>, which returns the answer and finishes the task.
"""
```

### Few-shot prompting to enable in-context learning with Gemini


While large language models show good understanding of the instructions they are prompted with, they still may perform poorly on complex tasks in a zero-shot setting. Hence, you will now provide a few examples along with your prompt to steer the model's output according to your needs. This in-context learning improves the model's performance significantly.


```
examples = """
Here are some examples.

Question
What is the elevation range for the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into?

Thought 1
I need to search Colorado orogeny, find the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into, then find the elevation range of the area.

Action 1
<search>Colorado orogeny</search>

Observation 1
The Colorado orogeny was an episode of mountain building (an orogeny) in Colorado and surrounding areas.

Thought 2
It does not mention the eastern sector. So I need to look up eastern sector.

Action 2
<lookup>eastern sector</lookup>

Observation 2
The eastern sector extends into the High Plains and is called the Central Plains orogeny.

Thought 3
The eastern sector of Colorado orogeny extends into the High Plains. So I need to search High Plains and find its elevation range.

Action 3
<search>High Plains</search>

Observation 3
High Plains refers to one of two distinct land regions

Thought 4
I need to instead search High Plains (United States).

Action 4
<search>High Plains (United States)</search>

Observation 4
The High Plains are a subregion of the Great Plains. From east to west, the High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft (550 to 2,130m).

Thought 5
High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft, so the answer is 1,800 to 7,000 ft.

Action 5
<finish>1,800 to 7,000 ft</finish>

Question
Musician and satirist Allie Goertz wrote a song about the "The Simpsons" character Milhouse, who Matt Groening named after who?

Thought 1
The question simplifies to "The Simpsons" character Milhouse is named after who. I only need to search Milhouse and find who it is named after.

Action 1
<search>Milhouse</search>

Observation 1
Milhouse Mussolini Van Houten is a recurring character in the Fox animated television series The Simpsons voiced by Pamela Hayden and created by Matt Groening.

Thought 2
The paragraph does not tell who Milhouse is named after, maybe I can look up "named after".

Action 2
<lookup>named after</lookup>

Observation 2
Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, whose middle name was Milhous.

Thought 3
Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, so the answer is Richard Nixon.

Action 3
<finish>Richard Nixon</finish>

Question
Which documentary is about Finnish rock groups, Adam Clayton Powell or The Saimaa Gesture?

Thought 1
I need to search Adam Clayton Powell and The Saimaa Gesture, and find which documentary is about Finnish rock groups.

Action 1
<search>Adam Clayton Powell</search>

Observation 1
Could not find [Adam Clayton Powell]. Similar: [’Adam Clayton Powell III’, ’Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)’, ’Adam Clayton Powell Jr. State Office Building’, ’Isabel Washington Powell’, ’Adam Powell’, ’Adam Clayton Powell (film)’, ’Giancarlo Esposito’].

Thought 2
To find the documentary, I can search Adam Clayton Powell (film).

Action 2
<search>Adam Clayton Powell (film)</search>

Observation 2
Adam Clayton Powell is a 1989 American documentary film directed by Richard Kilberg. The film is about the rise and fall of influential African-American politician Adam Clayton Powell Jr.[3][4] It was later aired as part of the PBS series The American Experience.

Thought 3
Adam Clayton Powell (film) is a documentary about an African-American politician, not Finnish rock groups. So the documentary about Finnish rock groups must instead be The Saimaa Gesture.

Action 3
<finish>The Saimaa Gesture</finish>

Question
What profession does Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan have in common?

Thought 1
I need to search Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan, find their professions, then find the profession they have in common.

Action 1
<search>Nicholas Ray</search>

Observation 1
Nicholas Ray (born Raymond Nicholas Kienzle Jr., August 7, 1911 - June 16, 1979) was an American film director, screenwriter, and actor best known for the 1955 film Rebel Without a Cause.

Thought 2
Professions of Nicholas Ray are director, screenwriter, and actor. I need to search Elia Kazan next and find his professions.

Action 2
<search>Elia Kazan</search>

Observation 2
Elia Kazan was an American film and theatre director, producer, screenwriter and actor.

Thought 3
Professions of Elia Kazan are director, producer, screenwriter, and actor. So profession Nicholas Ray and Elia Kazan have in common is director, screenwriter, and actor.

Action 3
<finish>director, screenwriter, actor</finish>

Question
Which magazine was started first Arthur’s Magazine or First for Women?

Thought 1
I need to search Arthur’s Magazine and First for Women, and find which was started first.

Action 1
<search>Arthur’s Magazine</search>

Observation 1
Arthur’s Magazine (1844-1846) was an American literary periodical published in Philadelphia in the 19th century.

Thought 2
Arthur’s Magazine was started in 1844. I need to search First for Women next.

Action 2
<search>First for Women</search>

Observation 2
First for Women is a woman’s magazine published by Bauer Media Group in the USA.[1] The magazine was started in 1989.

Thought 3
First for Women was started in 1989. 1844 (Arthur’s Magazine) < 1989 (First for Women), so Arthur’s Magazine was started first.

Action 3
<finish>Arthur’s Magazine</finish>

Question
Were Pavel Urysohn and Leonid Levin known for the same type of work?

Thought 1
I need to search Pavel Urysohn and Leonid Levin, find their types of work, then find if they are the same.

Action 1
<search>Pavel Urysohn</search>

Observation 1
Pavel Samuilovich Urysohn (February 3, 1898 - August 17, 1924) was a Soviet mathematician who is best known for his contributions in dimension theory.

Thought 2
Pavel Urysohn is a mathematician. I need to search Leonid Levin next and find its type of work.

Action 2
<search>Leonid Levin</search>

Observation 2
Leonid Anatolievich Levin is a Soviet-American mathematician and computer scientist.

Thought 3
Leonid Levin is a mathematician and computer scientist. So Pavel Urysohn and Leonid Levin have the same type of work.

Action 3
<finish>yes</finish>

Question
{question}"""
```

Copy the instructions along with examples in a file called `model_instructions.txt`


```
ReAct_prompt = model_instructions + examples
with open('model_instructions.txt', 'w') as f:
  f.write(ReAct_prompt)
```

## The Gemini-ReAct pipeline

### Setup

You will now build an end-to-end pipeline to facilitate multi-turn chat with the ReAct-prompted Gemini model.


```
class ReAct:
  def __init__(self, model: str, ReAct_prompt: str | os.PathLike):
    """Prepares Gemini to follow a `Few-shot ReAct prompt` by imitating
    `function calling` technique to generate both reasoning traces and
    task-specific actions in an interleaved manner.

    Args:
        model: name to the model.
        ReAct_prompt: ReAct prompt OR path to the ReAct prompt.
    """
    self.model = genai.GenerativeModel(model)
    self.chat = self.model.start_chat(history=[])
    self.should_continue_prompting = True
    self._search_history: list[str] = []
    self._search_urls: list[str] = []

    try:
      # try to read the file
      with open(ReAct_prompt, 'r') as f:
        self._prompt = f.read()
    except FileNotFoundError:
      # assume that the parameter represents prompt itself rather than path to the prompt file.
      self._prompt = ReAct_prompt

  @property
  def prompt(self):
    return self._prompt

  @classmethod
  def add_method(cls, func):
    setattr(cls, func.__name__, func)

  @staticmethod
  def clean(text: str):
    """Helper function for responses."""
    text = text.replace("\n", " ")
    return text
```

### Define tools


As instructed by the prompt, the model will be generating **Thought-Action-Observation** traces, where every **Action** trace could be one of the following tokens:


1.   </search/> : Perform a Wikipedia search via external API.
2.   </lookup/> : Lookup for specific information on a page with the Wikipedia API.
3.   </finish/> : Stop the execution of the model and return the answer.

If the model encounters any of these tokens, the model should make use of the `tools` made available to the model. This understanding of the model to leverage acquired toolsets to collect information from the external world is often referred to as **function calling**. Therefore, the next goal is to imitate this function calling technique in order to allow ReAct prompted Gemini model to access the external groundtruth.

The Gemini API supports function calling and you could use this feature to set up your tools. However, for this tutorial, you will learn to simulate it using `stop_sequences` parameter.


Define the tools:

#### Search
Define a method to perform Wikipedia searches


```
@ReAct.add_method
def search(self, query: str):
    """Perfoms search on `query` via Wikipedia api and returns its summary.

    Args:
        query: Search parameter to query the Wikipedia API with.

    Returns:
        observation: Summary of Wikipedia search for `query` if found else
        similar search results.
    """
    observation = None
    query = query.strip()
    try:
      # try to get the summary for requested `query` from the Wikipedia
      observation = wikipedia.summary(query, sentences=4, auto_suggest=False)
      wiki_url = wikipedia.page(query, auto_suggest=False).url
      observation = self.clean(observation)

      # if successful, return the first 2-3 sentences from the summary as model's context
      observation = self.model.generate_content(f'Retun the first 2 or 3 \
      sentences from the following text: {observation}')
      observation = observation.text

      # keep track of the model's search history
      self._search_history.append(query)
      self._search_urls.append(wiki_url)
      print(f"Information Source: {wiki_url}")

    # if the page is ambiguous/does not exist, return similar search phrases for model's context
    except (DisambiguationError, PageError) as e:
      observation = f'Could not find ["{query}"].'
      # get a list of similar search topics
      search_results = wikipedia.search(query)
      observation += f' Similar: {search_results}. You should search for one of those instead.'

    return observation
```

#### Lookup
Look for a specific phrase on the Wikipedia page.


```
@ReAct.add_method
def lookup(self, phrase: str, context_length=200):
    """Searches for the `phrase` in the lastest Wikipedia search page
    and returns number of sentences which is controlled by the
    `context_length` parameter.

    Args:
        phrase: Lookup phrase to search for within a page. Generally
        attributes to some specification of any topic.

        context_length: Number of words to consider
        while looking for the answer.

    Returns:
        result: Context related to the `phrase` within the page.
    """
    # get the last searched Wikipedia page and find `phrase` in it.
    page = wikipedia.page(self._search_history[-1], auto_suggest=False)
    page = page.content
    page = self.clean(page)
    start_index = page.find(phrase)

    # extract sentences considering the context length defined
    result = page[max(0, start_index - context_length):start_index+len(phrase)+context_length]
    print(f"Information Source: {self._search_urls[-1]}")
    return result
```

#### Finish
Instruct the pipline to terminate its execution.


```
@ReAct.add_method
def finish(self, _):
  """Finishes the conversation on encountering <finish> token by
  setting the `self.should_continue_prompting` flag to `False`.
  """
  self.should_continue_prompting = False
  print(f"Information Sources: {self._search_urls}")
```

### Stop tokens and function calling imitation

Now that you are all set with function definitions, the next step is to instruct the model to interrupt its execution upon encountering any of the action tokens. You will make use of the `stop_sequences` parameter from [`genai.GenerativeModel.GenerationConfig`](https://ai.google.dev/api/python/google/generativeai/GenerationConfig) class to instruct the model when to stop. Upon encountering an action token, the pipeline will simply extract what specific token from the `stop_sequences` argument terminated the model's execution, and then call the appropriate **tool** (function).

The function's response will be added to model's chat history for continuing the context link.


```
@ReAct.add_method
def __call__(self, user_question, max_calls: int=8, **generation_kwargs):
  """Starts multi-turn conversation with the chat models with function calling

  Args:
      max_calls: max calls made to the model to get the final answer.

      generation_kwargs: Same as genai.GenerativeModel.GenerationConfig

### Test ReAct prompted Gemini model


```
gemini_ReAct_chat = ReAct(model='gemini-1.5-flash', ReAct_prompt='model_instructions.txt')
# Note: try different combinations of generational_config parameters for variational results
gemini_ReAct_chat("What are the total of ages of the main trio from the new Percy Jackson and the Olympians TV series in real life?", temperature=0.2)
```

    Thought 1
    I need to find the ages of the main trio from the new Percy Jackson and the Olympians TV series in real life, then add them together.
    
    Action 1
    <search>Percy Jackson and the Olympians TV series </search>
    
    Observation 1
    Could not find ["Percy Jackson and the Olympians TV series"]. Similar: ['Percy Jackson and the Olympians (TV series)', 'Percy Jackson & the Olympians', 'Percy Jackson (film series)', 'Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief', 'Percy Jackson (disambiguation)', 'Percy Jackson', 'List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan', 'The Lightning Thief', 'The Heroes of Olympus', 'Brandon T. Jackson']. You should search for one of those instead.
    Thought 2:
    The search for the exact phrase "Percy Jackson and the Olympians TV series" failed. I should try searching for one of the suggested alternatives. "Percy Jackson and the Olympians (TV series)" seems like the most likely match.
    
    Action 2:
    <search>Percy Jackson and the Olympians (TV series) </search>
    Information Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percy_Jackson_and_the_Olympians_(TV_series)
    
    Observation 2
    Percy Jackson and the Olympians is an American fantasy television series created by Rick Riordan and Jonathan E. Steinberg for Disney+, based on the book series of the same name by Riordan.  Walker Scobell stars as Percy Jackson, alongside Leah Sava Jeffries as Annabeth Chase and Aryan Simhadri as Grover Underwood. 
    
    Thought 3:
    The output provides the names of the actors playing the main trio: Walker Scobell, Leah Sava Jeffries, and Aryan Simhadri. I need to find their ages.
    
    Action 3:
    <search>Walker Scobell age </search>
    
    Observation 3
    Could not find ["Walker Scobell age"]. Similar: ['Walker Scobell', 'The Adam Project', 'Percy Jackson', 'Aryan Simhadri', 'Hiro Kanagawa', 'Maximum Effort', 'Michael Douglas on stage and screen', 'List of awards and nominations received by Ryan Reynolds', 'List of American current child actors', 'Oliver Cromwell']. You should search for one of those instead.
    Thought 4:
    The search for "Walker Scobell age" failed. I should try searching for "Walker Scobell" and see if his age is mentioned in the Wikipedia page.
    
    Action 4:
    <search>Walker Scobell </search>
    Information Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walker_Scobell
    
    Observation 4
    Walker Scobell (born January 5, 2009) is an American actor. He has starred in the 2022 action comedy films The Adam Project and Secret Headquarters. 
    
    Thought 5:
    The output tells us Walker Scobell was born on January 5, 2009. To find his age, I need to calculate the difference between his birth year and the current year.
    
    Action 5:
    <finish>14 </finish>
    Information Sources: ['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percy_Jackson_and_the_Olympians_(TV_series)', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walker_Scobell']
    

Now, try asking the same question to `gemini-1.5-flash` model without the ReAct prompt.


```
gemini_ReAct_chat.model.generate_content("What is the total of ages of the main trio from the new Percy Jackson and the Olympians TV series in real life?").text
```




    "It is impossible to determine the total age of the main trio from the new Percy Jackson and the Olympians TV series in real life. This is because:\n\n* **The ages of the actors are not publicly known.** While some websites may have guesses or estimates, these are unreliable. \n* **The characters' ages are different from the actors' ages.**  The characters are teenagers in the series, while the actors are likely older. \n\nTherefore, without knowing the actors' actual birthdates, it is impossible to calculate their combined age. \n"



## Summary

The ReAct prompted Gemini model is grounded by external information sources and hence is less prone to hallucination. Furthermore, Thought-Action-Observation  traces generated by the model enhance human interpretability and trustworthiness by allowing users to witness the model's reasoning process for answering the user's query.


## Next steps


Head over to this [Streamlit app](https://mayochat.streamlit.app/) to interact with a ReAct prompted Gemini bot built with this code.

# SearxNG Search

This notebook goes over how to use a self hosted `SearxNG` search API to search the web.

You can [check this link](https://docs.searxng.org/dev/search_api.html) for more informations about `Searx API` parameters.


```python
import pprint

from langchain_community.utilities import SearxSearchWrapper
```


```python
search = SearxSearchWrapper(searx_host="http://127.0.0.1:8888")
```

For some engines, if a direct `answer` is available the warpper will print the answer instead of the full list of search results. You can use the `results` method of the wrapper if you want to obtain all the results.


```python
search.run("What is the capital of France")
```




    'Paris is the capital of France, the largest country of Europe with 550 000 km2 (65 millions inhabitants). Paris has 2.234 million inhabitants end 2011. She is the core of Ile de France region (12 million people).'



## Custom Parameters

SearxNG supports [135 search engines](https://docs.searxng.org/user/configured_engines.html). You can also customize the Searx wrapper with arbitrary named parameters that will be passed to the Searx search API . In the below example we will making a more interesting use of custom search parameters from searx search api.

In this example we will be using the `engines` parameters to query wikipedia


```python
search = SearxSearchWrapper(
    searx_host="http://127.0.0.1:8888", k=5
)  # k is for max number of items
```


```python
search.run("large language model ", engines=["wiki"])
```




    'Large language models (LLMs) represent a major advancement in AI, with the promise of transforming domains through learned knowledge. LLM sizes have been increasing 10X every year for the last few years, and as these models grow in complexity and size, so do their capabilities.\n\nGPT-3 can translate language, write essays, generate computer code, and more — all with limited to no supervision. In July 2020, OpenAI unveiled GPT-3, a language model that was easily the largest known at the time. Put simply, GPT-3 is trained to predict the next word in a sentence, much like how a text message autocomplete feature works.\n\nA large language model, or LLM, is a deep learning algorithm that can recognize, summarize, translate, predict and generate text and other content based on knowledge gained from massive datasets. Large language models are among the most successful applications of transformer models.\n\nAll of today’s well-known language models—e.g., GPT-3 from OpenAI, PaLM or LaMDA from Google, Galactica or OPT from Meta, Megatron-Turing from Nvidia/Microsoft, Jurassic-1 from AI21 Labs—are...\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3are increasingly being used to generate text. These tools should be used with care, since they can generate content that is biased, non-verifiable, constitutes original research, or violates copyrights.'

## Obtaining results with metadata

In this example we will be looking for scientific paper using the `categories` parameter and limiting the results to a `time_range` (not all engines support the time range option).

We also would like to obtain the results in a structured way including metadata. For this we will be using the `results` method of the wrapper.


```python
search = SearxSearchWrapper(searx_host="http://127.0.0.1:8888")

# SEC filing


>[SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/edgar) is a financial statement or other formal document submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Public companies, certain insiders, and broker-dealers are required to make regular `SEC filings`. Investors and financial professionals rely on these filings for information about companies they are evaluating for investment purposes.
>
>`SEC filings` data powered by [Kay.ai](https://kay.ai) and [Cybersyn](https://www.cybersyn.com/) via [Snowflake Marketplace](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/providers/GZTSZAS2KCS/Cybersyn%2C%20Inc).


## Setup


First, you will need to install the `kay` package. You will also need an API key: you can get one for free at [https://kay.ai](https://kay.ai/). Once you have an API key, you must set it as an environment variable `KAY_API_KEY`.

In this example, we're going to use the `KayAiRetriever`. Take a look at the [kay notebook](/docs/integrations/retrievers/kay) for more detailed information for the parameters that it accepts.`


```python
# Setup API keys for Kay and OpenAI
from getpass import getpass

KAY_API_KEY = getpass()
OPENAI_API_KEY = getpass()
```

     ········
     ········
    


```python
import os

os.environ["KAY_API_KEY"] = KAY_API_KEY
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = OPENAI_API_KEY
```

## Example


```python

```python
def get_context_length(prompt: PromptValue):
    messages = prompt.to_messages()
    tokens = short_context_model.get_num_tokens_from_messages(messages)

## Setup

First, let's import the necessary libraries and set up our environment.


```python
import os
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import random
from collections import Counter

# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()

# Set up OpenAI API key
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')

# Initialize the language model
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini")
```

## Generating Multiple Reasoning Paths

Let's create a function that generates multiple reasoning paths for a given problem.


```python
def generate_multiple_paths(problem, num_paths=3):
    """
    Generate multiple reasoning paths for a given problem.
    
    Args:
    problem (str): The problem statement.
    num_paths (int): Number of reasoning paths to generate.
    
    Returns:
    list: A list of generated reasoning paths.
    """
    prompt_template = PromptTemplate(
        input_variables=["problem", "path_number"],
        template="""Solve the following problem using a unique approach. This is reasoning path {path_number}.
        Problem: {problem}
        Reasoning path {path_number}:"""
    )

    paths = []
    for i in range(num_paths):
        chain = prompt_template | llm
        response = chain.invoke({"problem": problem, "path_number": i+1}).content
        paths.append(response)
    
    return paths
```

Now, let's test our function with a sample problem.


```python
problem = "A ball is thrown upwards with an initial velocity of 20 m/s. How high will it go?"
paths = generate_multiple_paths(problem)

for i, path in enumerate(paths, 1):
    print(f"Path {i}:\n{path}\n")
```

    Path 1:
    To solve the problem of how high a ball will go when thrown upwards with an initial velocity of 20 m/s, we can use the principles of kinematics, particularly the equations of motion under constant acceleration due to gravity.
    
    ### Reasoning Path 1:
    
    1. **Identify the Variables:**
       - Initial velocity (\(v_0\)) = 20 m/s (upward)
       - Final velocity (\(v\)) at the highest point = 0 m/s (the ball stops rising at the peak)
       - Acceleration due to gravity (\(g\)) = -9.81 m/s² (negative because it acts downward)
    
    2. **Use the Kinematic Equation:**
       We can use the following kinematic equation that relates initial velocity, final velocity, acceleration, and displacement (height in this case):
    
       \[
       v^2 = v_0^2 + 2a s
       \]
    
       Here, \(s\) is the maximum height, \(v_0\) is the initial velocity, \(v\) is the final velocity, and \(a\) is the acceleration. Plugging in the values we have:
    
       \[
       0 = (20)^2 + 2(-9.81)s
       \]
    
    3. **Rearranging the Equation:**
       Rearranging this equation to solve for \(s\):
    
       \[
       0 = 400 - 19.62s
       \]
    
       \[
       19.62s = 400
       \]
    
       \[
       s = \frac{400}{19.62}
       \]
    
    4. **Calculate the Height:**
       Performing the calculation:
    
       \[
       s \approx 20.39 \text{ meters}
       \]
    
    ### Conclusion:
    The maximum height the ball will reach when thrown upwards with an initial velocity of 20 m/s is approximately **20.39 meters**.
    
    Path 2:
    To solve the problem of how high a ball will go when thrown upwards with an initial velocity of 20 m/s, we can use the principles of kinematics, specifically focusing on the concepts of initial velocity, acceleration due to gravity, and the point at which the ball reaches its maximum height.
    
    ### Step 1: Understand the situation
    When the ball is thrown upwards, it will eventually slow down due to the force of gravity acting against its motion. The acceleration due to gravity (g) is approximately -9.81 m/s² (the negative sign indicates that gravity acts in the opposite direction to the motion of the ball).
    
    ### Step 2: Use the kinematic equation
    We can use the following kinematic equation to find the maximum height (h) reached by the ball:
    
    \[
    v^2 = u^2 + 2a s
    \]
    
    Where:
    - \( v \) = final velocity at the maximum height (0 m/s, since the ball stops rising at that point)
    - \( u \) = initial velocity (20 m/s)
    - \( a \) = acceleration (which is -9.81 m/s²)
    - \( s \) = displacement (maximum height, h)
    
    ### Step 3: Set up the equation
    At the maximum height, the final velocity \( v \) is 0. Plugging in the values, we get:
    
    \[
    0 = (20)^2 + 2(-9.81)h
    \]
    
    ### Step 4: Simplify and solve for h
    This simplifies to:
    
    \[
    0 = 400 - 19.62h
    \]
    
    Rearranging gives:
    
    \[
    19.62h = 400
    \]
    
    Now, divide both sides by 19.62:
    
    \[
    h = \frac{400}{19.62} \approx 20.39 \text{ meters}
    \]
    
    ### Conclusion
    The maximum height the ball will reach is approximately **20.39 meters**. This unique approach clearly outlines the use of kinematic equations to derive the height based on initial conditions and the effects of gravity.
    
    Path 3:
    To solve the problem of how high a ball will go when thrown upwards with an initial velocity of 20 m/s, we can use the principles of kinematics and energy conservation. Here, we'll use energy conservation as our unique approach.
    
    ### Step 1: Understanding the Energy Conservation Principle
    
    When the ball is thrown upwards, it has kinetic energy due to its initial velocity. As it rises, this kinetic energy is converted into gravitational potential energy until it reaches its maximum height, where its velocity becomes zero.
    
    ### Step 2: Formulating the Energy Equation
    
    The kinetic energy (KE) at the moment the ball is thrown can be expressed as:
    
    \[
    KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2
    \]
    
    where:
    - \( m \) is the mass of the ball,
    - \( v \) is the initial velocity (20 m/s).
    
    The gravitational potential energy (PE) at the maximum height can be expressed as:
    
    \[
    PE = mgh
    \]
    
    where:
    - \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately \( 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)),
    - \( h \) is the maximum height reached.
    
    ### Step 3: Setting Up the Equation
    
    At the maximum height, all the kinetic energy will be converted into potential energy:
    
    \[
    \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = mgh
    \]
    
    Notice that the mass \( m \) can be canceled from both sides of the equation:
    
    \[
    \frac{1}{2}v^2 = gh
    \]
    
    ### Step 4: Solving for Maximum Height
    
    Now we can rearrange the equation to solve for \( h \):
    
    \[
    h = \frac{\frac{1}{2}v^2}{g}
    \]
    
    ### Step 5: Plugging in the Values
    
    Substituting \( v = 20 \, \text{m/s} \) and \( g = 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \):
    
    \[
    h = \frac{\frac{1}{2}(20)^2}{9.81}
    \]
    \[
    h = \frac{200}{9.81}
    \]
    \[
    h \approx 20.39 \, \text{m}
    \]
    
    ### Conclusion
    
    The maximum height the ball will reach is approximately **20.39 meters**. This method effectively utilizes energy conservation principles, providing a unique approach to solving the problem.
    
    

## Aggregating Results

Now that we have multiple reasoning paths, let's create a function to aggregate the results and determine the most consistent answer.


```python
def aggregate_results(paths):
    """
    Aggregate results from multiple reasoning paths.
    
    Args:
    paths (list): List of reasoning paths.
    
    Returns:
    str: The most consistent answer.
    """
    prompt_template = PromptTemplate(
        input_variables=["paths"],
        template="""Analyze the following reasoning paths and determine the most consistent answer. If there are discrepancies, explain why and provide the most likely correct answer.
        Reasoning paths:
        {paths}
        
        Most consistent answer:"""
    )

    chain = prompt_template | llm
    response = chain.invoke({"paths": "\n".join(paths)}).content
    return response
```

Let's apply this aggregation function to our previous results.


```python
aggregated_result = aggregate_results(paths)
print("Aggregated Result:\n", aggregated_result)
```

    Aggregated Result:
     The most consistent answer across all reasoning paths is that the maximum height the ball will reach when thrown upwards with an initial velocity of 20 m/s is approximately **20.39 meters**.
    
    ### Analysis of Reasoning Paths:
    1. **Reasoning Path 1 and Path 2 (Kinematic Equations)**:
       - Both paths correctly identify the necessary variables and apply the kinematic equation \( v^2 = v_0^2 + 2a s \). They both arrive at the same conclusion through proper rearrangement and calculation.
       - The calculations performed in both paths are consistent, leading to the same result of 20.39 meters.
    
    2. **Reasoning Path 3 (Energy Conservation)**:
       - This path uses a different approach by leveraging the conservation of energy. It starts with kinetic energy and equates it to potential energy at the maximum height.
       - The final result of 20.39 meters is consistent with the previous paths, confirming that the calculation is valid regardless of the method used.
    
    ### Conclusion:
    Since all reasoning paths lead to the same calculated height of approximately **20.39 meters**, there are no discrepancies among them. The use of different methods (kinematic equations and energy conservation) corroborates the correctness of the result, making it robust and reliable. Thus, the most likely correct answer is indeed **20.39 meters**.
    

## Self-Consistency Check

To further improve our results, let's implement a self-consistency check that evaluates the reliability of our aggregated answer.


```python
def self_consistency_check(problem, aggregated_result):
    """
    Perform a self-consistency check on the aggregated result.
    
    Args:
    problem (str): The original problem statement.
    aggregated_result (str): The aggregated result to check.
    
    Returns:
    str: An evaluation of the result's consistency and reliability.
    """
    prompt_template = PromptTemplate(
        input_variables=["problem", "result"],
        template="""Evaluate the consistency and reliability of the following result for the given problem.
        Problem: {problem}
        Result: {result}
        
        Evaluation (consider factors like logical consistency, adherence to known facts, and potential biases):"""
    )

    chain = prompt_template | llm
    response = chain.invoke({"problem": problem, "result": aggregated_result}).content
    return response
```

Now, let's apply the self-consistency check to our aggregated result.


```python
consistency_evaluation = self_consistency_check(problem, aggregated_result)
print("Self-Consistency Evaluation:\n", consistency_evaluation)
```

    Self-Consistency Evaluation:
     ### Evaluation of Consistency and Reliability
    
    1. **Logical Consistency**:
       - The reasoning paths presented are logically consistent in their approach to solving the problem. Both kinematic equations and energy conservation principles are valid methods for determining the maximum height of a projectile. The fact that all paths arrive at the same numerical result reinforces the logical soundness of the conclusion.
    
    2. **Adherence to Known Facts**:
       - The use of the kinematic equation \( v^2 = v_0^2 + 2as \) and the principle of energy conservation (where kinetic energy at the initial height is converted to potential energy at the maximum height) are both grounded in classical mechanics. The initial velocity of 20 m/s and acceleration due to gravity (approximately -9.81 m/s²) are standard parameters used in projectile motion problems. The calculations are therefore based on known physical laws and principles.
    
    3. **Calculation Accuracy**:
       - It is important to verify the calculations that lead to the conclusion of 20.39 meters. Using the kinematic equation:
         \[
         v^2 = v_0^2 + 2as
         \]
         where:
         - \( v \) (final velocity at the peak) = 0 m/s,
         - \( v_0 \) (initial velocity) = 20 m/s,
         - \( a \) (acceleration due to gravity) = -9.81 m/s²,
         - \( s \) (displacement or maximum height) is what we want to find.
    
         Rearranging gives:
         \[
         0 = (20)^2 + 2(-9.81)s
         \]
         \[
         0 = 400 - 19.62s
         \]
         \[
         19.62s = 400 \Rightarrow s = \frac{400}{19.62} \approx 20.39 \text{ meters}
         \]
    
       - Similarly, applying energy conservation:
         \[
         \frac{1}{2}mv_0^2 = mgh
         \]
         where \( m \) cancels out, confirms:
         \[
         20^2 = 2gh \Rightarrow h = \frac{20^2}{2 \cdot 9.81} \approx 20.39 \text{ meters}
         \]
    
    4. **Potential Biases**:
       - There appears to be no bias in the reasoning paths, as both methods independently yield the same result. The analysis does not favor one method over the other, ensuring that the conclusion is drawn fairly from multiple approaches.
    
    ### Conclusion:
    The result of approximately **20.39 meters** is consistent and reliable based on the analysis provided. The calculations adhere to established physical laws, and the use of different reasoning paths yields the same outcome, reinforcing the accuracy of the conclusion. Therefore, the evaluation confirms that the result can be accepted with confidence.
    

## Applying to Different Problem Types

Let's demonstrate how this approach can be applied to different types of problems.


```python
def solve_problem(problem):
    """
    Solve a problem using multiple reasoning paths, aggregation, and self-consistency check.
    
    Args:
    problem (str): The problem statement.
    
    Returns:
    tuple: (aggregated_result, consistency_evaluation)
    """
    paths = generate_multiple_paths(problem)
    aggregated_result = aggregate_results(paths)
    consistency_evaluation = self_consistency_check(problem, aggregated_result)
    return aggregated_result, consistency_evaluation

# Example problems
problems = [
    "What is the capital of France?",
    "Explain the concept of supply and demand in economics.",
    "If a train travels at 60 km/h, how long will it take to cover 180 km?"
]

for problem in problems:
    print(f"Problem: {problem}")
    result, evaluation = solve_problem(problem)
    print("Aggregated Result:\n", result)
    print("\nConsistency Evaluation:\n", evaluation)
    print("\n" + "-"*50 + "\n")
```

    Problem: What is the capital of France?
    Aggregated Result:
     The most consistent answer across all three reasoning paths is that the capital of France is **Paris**. 
    
    ### Explanation of Consistency:
    1. **Identification of the Country**: All reasoning paths correctly identify France as the country in question.
    2. **Cultural and Historical Significance**: Each path emphasizes the cultural, historical, and political importance of Paris, which is consistent with its designation as the capital.
    3. **Political Center**: The mention of key political institutions and the central role of Paris in the governance of France is present in all paths.
    4. **Common Knowledge**: Each reasoning path acknowledges that Paris is widely recognized as the capital, reinforcing the answer through common educational knowledge.
    
    ### Conclusion:
    Due to the alignment in identifying Paris as the capital based on cultural, historical, and political significance, as well as its recognition in common knowledge, the most likely correct answer is indeed **Paris**. There are no discrepancies in the reasoning paths that would suggest an alternative answer.
    
    Consistency Evaluation:
     The evaluation of the provided result regarding the capital of France, which is identified as Paris, demonstrates strong consistency and reliability based on several factors. Here’s a detailed assessment:
    
    ### 1. **Logical Consistency**
    - Each reasoning path aligns logically with the question posed. The identification of France as the country and Paris as its capital is coherent and follows a rational framework. There are no contradictions in the reasoning processes, which enhances the overall reliability of the conclusion.
    
    ### 2. **Adherence to Known Facts**
    - The answer explicitly states that Paris is the capital of France, which is a well-established fact recognized internationally. This aligns with historical, political, and cultural knowledge, making the conclusion factually accurate. The reinforcement of this fact across multiple reasoning paths further solidifies its validity.
    
    ### 3. **Cultural and Historical Context**
    - The emphasis on Paris’s cultural, historical, and political significance is pertinent. Not only is Paris the administrative center of France, but it also has a rich heritage that contributes to its status as the capital. This contextualization strengthens the answer and demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.
    
    ### 4. **Common Knowledge and Consensus**
    - The recognition of Paris as the capital of France is pervasive in education and general knowledge.

    Problem: Explain the concept of supply and demand in economics.
    Aggregated Result:
     The most consistent answer is that all three reasoning paths illustrate the fundamental concepts of supply and demand in economics through storytelling, but they each present slightly different scenarios that reinforce the same principles.
    
    ### Analysis of Reasoning Paths
    
    1. **Reasoning Path 1** focuses on a bakery scenario, using the relationship between the price of bread and how it affects consumer demand and the baker's supply. It explains the concepts of supply, demand, market equilibrium, and how changes in price impact both sides.
    
    2. **Reasoning Path 2** introduces Sally's lemonade stand in Econoville, showcasing a similar dynamic where the price of lemonade affects how much consumers are willing to buy and how much Sally is willing to supply. It illustrates the same concepts of supply and demand with a different product and market condition, including shifts in demand due to external factors like weather.
    
    3. **Reasoning Path 3** tells the story of Lucy in a market garden, where the effects of a bountiful harvest and a drought directly influence supply and demand. This narrative also captures the essence of market equilibrium and how external conditions can shift supply and demand.
    
    ### Consistency and Discrepancies
    
    The main consistency across all three paths is the demonstration of the basic economic principles: 
    - **Supply** (the quantity of goods producers are willing to sell at various prices)
    - **Demand** (the quantity of goods consumers are willing to buy at various prices)
    - **Market Equilibrium** (where supply equals demand at a certain price)
    
    Each path uses a relatable story to express these concepts, making them accessible and understandable. While there are different products (bread, lemonade, vegetables) and scenarios (price changes, weather effects), they all effectively illustrate the same underlying economic principles.
    
    ### Conclusion
    
    The most likely correct answer is that supply and demand are interdependent forces in the marketplace, as illustrated through these narratives. The stories effectively demonstrate how price fluctuations affect both supply and demand, leading to market equilibrium. The consistent theme is the relationship between what producers are willing to sell and what consumers are willing to buy, making the economic principles clear through relatable examples.
    
    Consistency Evaluation:
     The evaluation of the provided result regarding the concept of supply and demand in economics reveals several strengths and some areas for consideration in terms of consistency and reliability.
    
    ### Strengths:
    
    1. **Logical Consistency**: The reasoning paths consistently illustrate the fundamental economic principles of supply and demand. Each scenario is framed within the context of how price influences both consumer demand and producer supply, adhering to the basic tenets of microeconomics.
    
    2. **Adherence to Known Facts**: The examples provided (a bakery, a lemonade stand, and a market garden) are all grounded in real-world situations that can be easily understood by a wide audience. They accurately depict how external factors (price changes, weather conditions) can shift supply and demand, which aligns with established economic theories.
    
    3. **Clarity of Explanation**: The use of storytelling makes the concepts of supply and demand accessible and relatable. Each path effectively communicates the relationship between price, supply, and demand, which is essential for understanding market dynamics.
    
    4. **Illustration of Market Equilibrium**: The consistent mention of market equilibrium across all scenarios reinforces the importance of this concept in economics. It demonstrates how supply and demand interact to determine prices in a market.
    
    ### Areas for Consideration:
    
    1. **Potential Bias in Scenarios**: While all paths are valid, the reliance on common scenarios (like lemonade stands and bakeries) may overlook more complex market dynamics that can exist in real economies. For a comprehensive understanding, it could be beneficial to include examples from various industries or more complex market situations (e.g., monopolies, oligopolies, or global markets).
    
    2. **Simplification of Economic Dynamics**: The scenarios presented might simplify some of the complexities of supply and demand. For example, they do not address factors such as consumer preferences, the impact of advertising, or the role of government policies in influencing supply and demand, which are also crucial to a full understanding of these concepts.
    
    3. **Assumption of Rational Behavior**: The narratives appear to assume that consumers and producers act rationally, which is a common assumption in economic models. However, actual consumer behavior can be influenced by irrational factors, emotions, or social influences. Highlighting these aspects could provide a more nuanced understanding of the supply and demand framework.
    
    ### Conclusion:
    
    Overall, the result provided is consistent and reliable in explaining the concept of supply and demand in economics. It effectively utilizes relatable scenarios to illustrate fundamental principles while maintaining logical coherence. However, to enhance the evaluation, it would be beneficial to consider more diverse and complex examples, address potential biases, and acknowledge the limitations of the rational actor model. This would lead to a more comprehensive understanding of supply and demand in real-world economics.

    Problem: If a train travels at 60 km/h, how long will it take to cover 180 km?
    Aggregated Result:
     The most consistent answer across the three reasoning paths is that it will take the train **3 hours** to cover 180 km at a speed of 60 km/h.
    
    ### Explanation of Consistency:
    1. **Formula Used**: All three reasoning paths rely on the same fundamental relationship between distance, speed, and time, represented by the formula:
       \[
       \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
       \]
       This consistency in the formula ensures that the basis of the calculations is the same across all paths.
    
    2. **Substitution of Values**: Each path correctly identifies the distance as 180 km and the speed as 60 km/h, and correctly substitutes these values into the formula.
    
    3. **Calculation**: Each reasoning path performs the division in the same manner, leading to the same result:
       \[
       \text{Time} = \frac{180 \text{ km}}{60 \text{ km/h}} = 3 \text{ hours}
       \]
    
    4. **Conclusion**: Each reasoning path arrives at the same conclusion, affirming that the time required for the train to travel the specified distance at the given speed is indeed 3 hours.
    
    ### Summary:
    There are no discrepancies in any of the reasoning paths. They all correctly apply the distance-speed-time relationship and arrive at the same conclusion. Therefore, the most likely correct answer is **3 hours**.
    
    Consistency Evaluation:
     The evaluation of the result regarding how long it will take a train traveling at 60 km/h to cover 180 km can be broken down into several key factors: logical consistency, adherence to known facts, and potential biases.
    
    ### Logical Consistency:
    1. **Application of the Formula**: The result is based on the correct application of the distance-speed-time relationship, which is a well-established principle in physics. The formula used, \( \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \), is universally accepted and correctly applied here.
      
    2. **Uniform Calculations**: Each reasoning path leading to the final result uses the same mathematical operations to arrive at the conclusion. There is no indication of miscalculation or logical fallacy in any of the paths, reinforcing the reliability of the answer.
    
    ### Adherence to Known Facts:
    1. **Known Values**: The values used in the calculations—180 km as the distance and 60 km/h as the speed—are reasonable and typical for train travel, meaning there are no factual errors in the provided data.
    
    2. **Correct Interpretation of Units**: The reasoning correctly interprets the units of speed (km/h) and distance (km), leading to a coherent final unit of time (hours).
    
    ### Potential Biases:
    1. **Bias in Result Interpretation**: There does not appear to be any bias influencing the interpretation of the result; the answer is purely based on mathematical calculation rather than subjective reasoning.
    
    2. **Confirmation Bias**: If there were any external influences or pre-existing beliefs about the train’s speed or distance, those could lead to confirmation bias. However, in this case, the result is strictly based on calculations without any subjective input.
    
    ### Summary:
    The evaluation of the reasoning paths shows that they are logically consistent, adhere to known facts, and do not exhibit any identifiable biases. Each path arrives at the same conclusion through sound reasoning, confirming that the answer of **3 hours** is both consistent and reliable. The result is robust against scrutiny, and one can confidently assert that it accurately reflects the time required for the train to cover 180 km at a speed of 60 km/h.

     'selected_modules': 'To solve the task of identifying the shape drawn by the given SVG path element, the following reasoning modules are crucial:\n\n1. **Critical Thinking (10)**: This involves analyzing the SVG path commands and coordinates logically to understand the shape they form. It requires questioning assumptions (e.g., not assuming the shape based on a quick glance at the coordinates but rather analyzing the path commands and their implications) and evaluating the information provided by the SVG path data.\n\n2. **Analytical Problem Solving (29)**: The task requires data analysis skills to interpret the SVG path commands and coordinates. Understanding how the "M" (moveto) and "L" (lineto) commands work to draw lines between specified points is essential for determining the shape.\n\n3. **Creative Thinking (11)**: While the task primarily involves analytical skills, creative thinking can help in visualizing the shape that the path commands are likely to form, especially when the path data doesn\'t immediately suggest a common shape.\n\n4. **Systems Thinking (13)**: Recognizing the SVG path as part of a larger system (in this case, the SVG graphics system) and understanding how individual path commands contribute to the overall shape can be helpful. This involves understanding the interconnectedness of the start and end points of each line segment and how they come together to form a complete shape.\n\n5. **Break Down the Problem (9)**: Breaking down the SVG path into its individual commands and analyzing each segment between "M" and "L" commands can simplify the task. This makes it easier to visualize and understand the shape being drawn step by step.\n\n6. **Visualization (not explicitly listed but implied in creative and analytical thinking)**: Visualizing the path that the "M" and "L" commands create is essential. This isn\'t a listed module but is a skill that underpins both creative and analytical approaches to solving this problem.\n\nGiven the SVG path commands, one would analyze each segment drawn by "M" (moveto) and "L" (lineto) commands to determine the shape\'s vertices and sides. This process involves critical thinking to assess the information, analytical skills to interpret the path data, and a degree of creative thinking for visualization. The task does not directly involve assessing risks, long-term implications, or stakeholder perspectives, so modules focused on those aspects (e.g., Risk Analysis (14), Long-term Implications (8)) are less relevant here.',
     'adapted_modules': 'To enhance the process of identifying the shape drawn by the given SVG path element, the reasoning modules can be adapted and specified as follows:\n\n1. **Detailed Path Analysis (Critical Thinking)**: This module focuses on a meticulous examination of the SVG path commands and coordinates. It involves a deep dive into the syntax and semantics of path commands such as "M" (moveto) and "L" (lineto), challenging initial perceptions and rigorously interpreting the sequence of commands to deduce the shape accurately. This analysis goes beyond surface-level inspection, requiring a systematic questioning of each command\'s role in constructing the overall shape.\n\n2. **Path Command Interpretation (Analytical Problem Solving)**: Essential for this task is the ability to decode the SVG path\'s "M" and "L" commands, translating these instructions into a mental or visual representation of the shape\'s geometry. This module emphasizes the analytical dissection of the path data, focusing on how each command contributes to the formation of vertices and edges, thereby facilitating the identification of the shape.\n\n3. **Shape Visualization (Creative Thinking)**: Leveraging imagination to mentally construct the shape from the path commands is the core of this module. It involves creatively synthesizing the segments drawn by the "M" and "L" commands into a coherent visual image, even when the path data does not immediately suggest a recognizable shape. This creative process aids in bridging gaps in the analytical interpretation, offering alternative perspectives on the possible shape outcomes.\n\n4. **Path-to-Shape Synthesis (Systems Thinking)**: This module entails understanding the SVG path as a component within the broader context of vector graphics, focusing on how individual path commands interlink to form a cohesive shape. It requires an appreciation of the cumulative effect of each command in relation to the others, recognizing the systemic relationship between the starting and ending points of segments and their collective role in shaping the final figure.\n\n5. **Sequential Command Analysis (Break Down the Problem)**: By segmenting the SVG path into discrete commands, this approach simplifies the complexity of the task. It advocates for a step-by-step examination of the path, where each "M" to "L" sequence is analyzed in isolation before synthesizing the findings to understand the overall shape. This methodical breakdown facilitates a clearer visualization and comprehension of the shape being drawn.\n\n6. **Command-to-Geometry Mapping (Visualization)**: Central to solving this task is the ability to map the abstract "M" and "L" commands onto a concrete geometric representation. This implicit module underlies both the analytical and creative thinking processes, focusing on converting the path data into a visual form that can be easily understood and manipulated mentally.

Each command specifies a point in a 2D coordinate system.\n- Action: The path commands are as follows:\n  1. M 55.57,80.69 (Move to point)\n  2. L 57.38,65.80 (Line to point)\n  3. M 57.38,65.80 (Move to point)\n  4. L 48.90,57.46 (Line to point)\n  5. M 48.90,57.46 (Move to point)\n  6. L 45.58,47.78 (Line to point)\n  7. M 45.58,47.78 (Move to point)\n  8.

# Self-Improving Agent Tutorial

## Overview
This tutorial demonstrates the implementation of a Self-Improving Agent using LangChain, a framework for developing applications powered by language models. The agent is designed to engage in conversations, learn from its interactions, and continuously improve its performance over time.

## Motivation
As AI systems become more integrated into our daily lives, there's a growing need for agents that can adapt and improve based on their interactions. This self-improving agent serves as a practical example of how we can create AI systems that don't just rely on their initial training, but continue to evolve and enhance their capabilities through ongoing interactions.

## Key Components

1. **Language Model**: The core of the agent, responsible for generating responses and processing information.
2. **Chat History Management**: Keeps track of conversations for context and learning.
3. **Response Generation**: Produces relevant replies to user inputs.
4. **Reflection Mechanism**: Analyzes past interactions to identify areas for improvement.
5. **Learning System**: Incorporates insights from reflection to enhance future performance.

## Method Details

### Initialization
The agent is initialized with a language model, a conversation store, and a system for managing prompts and chains. This setup allows the agent to maintain context across multiple interactions and sessions.

### Response Generation
When the agent receives input, it considers the current conversation history and any recent insights gained from learning. This context-aware approach allows for more coherent and improving responses over time.

### Reflection Process
After a series of interactions, the agent reflects on its performance. It analyzes the conversation history to identify patterns, potential improvements, and areas where it could have provided better responses.

### Learning Mechanism
Based on the reflections, the agent generates learning points. These are concise summaries of how it can improve, which are then incorporated into its knowledge base and decision-making process for future interactions.

### Continuous Improvement Loop
The cycle of interaction, reflection, and learning creates a feedback loop that allows the agent to continuously refine its responses and adapt to different conversation styles and topics.

## Conclusion
This Self-Improving Agent demonstrates a practical implementation of an AI system that can learn and adapt from its interactions. By combining the power of large language models with mechanisms for reflection and learning, we create an agent that not only provides responses but also improves its capabilities over time.

This approach opens up exciting possibilities for creating more dynamic and adaptable AI assistants, chatbots, and other conversational AI applications. As we continue to refine these techniques, we move closer to AI systems that can truly learn and grow from their experiences, much like humans do.

## Imports and Setup

First, we'll import the necessary libraries and load our environment variables.


```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_core.runnables.history import RunnableWithMessageHistory
from langchain.memory import ChatMessageHistory
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os
load_dotenv()
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')
```




    True



## Helper Functions

We'll define helper functions for each capability of our agent.

### Chat History Management


```python
def get_chat_history(store, session_id: str):
    if session_id not in store:
        store[session_id] = ChatMessageHistory()
    return store[session_id]
```

### Response Generation


```python
def generate_response(chain_with_history, human_input: str, session_id: str, insights: str):
    response = chain_with_history.invoke(
        {"input": human_input, "insights": insights},
        config={"configurable": {"session_id": session_id}}
    )
    return response.content
```

### Reflection


```python
def reflect(llm, store, session_id: str):
    reflection_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
        ("system", "Based on the following conversation history, provide insights on how to improve responses:"),
        MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name="history"),
        ("human", "Generate insights for improvement:")
    ])
    reflection_chain = reflection_prompt | llm
    history = get_chat_history(store, session_id)
    reflection_response = reflection_chain.invoke({"history": history.messages})
    return reflection_response.content
```

### Learning


```python
def learn(llm, store, session_id: str, insights: str):
    learning_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
        ("system", "Based on these insights, update the agent's knowledge and behavior:"),
        ("human", "{insights}"),
        ("human", "Summarize the key points to remember:")
    ])
    learning_chain = learning_prompt | llm
    learned_points = learning_chain.invoke({"insights": insights}).content
    get_chat_history(store, session_id).add_ai_message(f"[SYSTEM] Agent learned: {learned_points}")
    return learned_points
```

## Self-Improving Agent Class

Now we'll define our `SelfImprovingAgent` class that uses these functions.


```python
class SelfImprovingAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini", max_tokens=1000, temperature=0.7)
        self.store = {}
        self.insights = ""
        
        self.prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
            ("system", "You are a self-improving AI assistant. Learn from your interactions and improve your performance over time."),
            MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name="history"),
            ("human", "{input}"),
            ("system", "Recent insights for improvement: {insights}")
        ])
        
        self.chain = self.prompt | self.llm
        self.chain_with_history = RunnableWithMessageHistory(
            self.chain,
            lambda session_id: get_chat_history(self.store, session_id),
            input_messages_key="input",
            history_messages_key="history"
        )

    def respond(self, human_input: str, session_id: str):
        return generate_response(self.chain_with_history, human_input, session_id, self.insights)

    def reflect(self, session_id: str):
        self.insights = reflect(self.llm, self.store, session_id)
        return self.insights

    def learn(self, session_id: str):
        self.reflect(session_id)
        return learn(self.llm, self.store, session_id, self.insights)
```

## Example Usage

Let's create an instance of our agent and interact with it to demonstrate its self-improving capabilities.


```python
agent = SelfImprovingAgent()
session_id = "user_123"

# Interaction 1
print("AI:", agent.respond("What's the capital of France?", session_id))

# Interaction 2
print("AI:", agent.respond("Can you tell me more about its history?", session_id))

# Learn and improve
print("\nReflecting and learning...")
learned = agent.learn(session_id)
print("Learned:", learned)

# Interaction 3 (potentially improved based on learning)
print("\nAI:", agent.respond("What's a famous landmark in this city?", session_id))

# Interaction 4 (to demonstrate continued improvement)
print("AI:", agent.respond("What's another interesting fact about this city?", session_id))
```

    AI: The capital of France is Paris.
    AI: Paris has a rich and complex history that spans thousands of years. Its story begins around the 3rd century BC with the Parisii, a Gallic tribe that settled on the banks of the River Seine. The Romans conquered the Parisii in 52 BC, establishing a town known as Lutetia, which flourished as a Roman city.
    
    In the Middle Ages, Paris emerged as a center of learning and the arts, home to one of the first universities in Europe, the University of Paris (founded around 1150). The city expanded its influence and infrastructure, including the construction of the iconic Notre-Dame Cathedral, which began in the 12th century.
    
    The Renaissance era brought further development, but it was also a period of religious strife, highlighted by the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre in 1572, where thousands of Huguenots (French Protestants) were killed. The 17th and 18th centuries were marked by the opulence of the Sun King, Louis XIV, and the construction of architectural marvels such as the Palace of Versailles.
    
    However, wealth disparities led to unrest, culminating in the French Revolution in 1789. Paris was the revolution's heart, witnessing significant events like the storming of the Bastille and the Reign of Terror. The 19th century saw the city transform under Napoleon Bonaparte and later, under Napoleon III and Baron Haussmann, who redesigned Paris with its wide boulevards, parks, and the iconic landmarks we recognize today.
    
    The 20th century was tumultuous, with Paris enduring two world wars, including the Nazi occupation during World War II. The post-war years were a time of reconstruction and cultural renaissance, solidifying Paris's status as a global hub of art, fashion, and gastronomy.
    
    Today, Paris is celebrated for its vibrant culture, historical monuments, and significant contributions to art, science, and philosophy. It remains a symbol of beauty, resilience, and the enduring spirit of enlightenment and innovation.
    
    Reflecting and learning...
    Learned: To enhance responses, especially for historical overviews, keep these key points in mind:
    
    1. **Prioritize Key Information**: Focus on the most significant events or aspects to keep the narrative engaging and digestible.
    
    2. **Incorporate Storytelling Elements**: Use storytelling to create compelling narratives, setting scenes, and highlighting the human aspects of history.
    
    3. **Use Clear, Vivid Language**: Employ descriptive language to paint a vivid picture of historical events and transformations.
    
    4. **Interactive Elements**: Suggest additional resources like further reading or virtual tours to provide a more in-depth understanding, where applicable.
    
    5. **Personalize Responses**: Tailor responses to the user's interests to increase relevance and engagement.
    
    6. **Inclusion of Lesser-Known Facts**: Intersperse lesser-known facts or anecdotes to pique interest and provide a unique perspective.
    
    7. **Clarity and Structure**: Organize the response clearly, possibly with subheadings or a chronological approach, to enhance understandability.
    
    8. **Encourage Interaction**: Conclude with an invitation for further questions, fostering ongoing engagement and tailored information sharing.
    
    By applying these principles, responses can be made more engaging, informative, and satisfying for the reader.
    
    AI: One of the most famous landmarks in Paris is the Eiffel Tower. Constructed from 1887 to 1889 as the entrance to the 1889 World's Fair, it was initially criticized by some of France's leading artists and intellectuals for its design but has since become a global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognizable structures in the world.
    
    Standing at approximately 324 meters (1,063 feet) tall, the Eiffel Tower was the tallest man-made structure in the world until the completion of the Chrysler Building in New York in 1930. It was designed by the French engineer Gustave Eiffel's company. The tower is made of iron and weighs about 10,000 tonnes. Despite its initial intended temporary presence, it was saved from dismantling due to its value as a radiotelegraph station and now attracts millions of visitors each year.
    
    The Eiffel Tower has three levels for visitors. Tickets can be purchased to ascend by stairs or elevators to the first and second levels. The journey to the top level offers a breathtaking panoramic view of Paris, making it one of the most visited monuments in the world.
    
    Beyond its architectural and engineering significance, the Eiffel Tower has become a symbol of French creativity and ingenuity, representing the spirit of progress and the beauty of Paris to the world. Whether seen up close or from one of the many beautiful vantage points in the city, the Eiffel Tower continues to awe visitors with its imposing structure and the story of its creation.
    
    For those interested in exploring more, virtual tours or a visit to the official Eiffel Tower website can offer deeper insights into its history, construction, and the experience of visiting this iconic monument.
    AI: Another interesting fact about Paris is its nickname, "The City of Light" ("La Ville Lumière"). This name originated in the 17th century, during the reign of King Louis XIV, when the city began to replace its dark, narrow streets with wide boulevards and installed thousands of gas lamps to illuminate them. This transformation made Paris one of the first major European cities to use street lighting extensively, enhancing its beauty and safety at night.
    
    However, the nickname also refers to Paris's leading role during the Age of Enlightenment, a period in the 18th century characterized by intellectual, cultural, and scientific advancements. Paris became a center for education, ideas, and philosophical thought, attracting scholars, artists, and writers from all over Europe. It was during this time that the city truly became a beacon of light, symbolizing hope, progress, and innovation.
    
    Today, the moniker "City of Light" aptly reflects both the literal illumination of Paris's streets and monuments, as well as its ongoing influence as a center for culture, art, fashion, and gastronomy. The sparkling lights of the Eiffel Tower at night and the illuminated bridges over the Seine River continue to enchant visitors, embodying the city's enduring charm and its historical significance as a beacon of enlightenment and progress.

Specifically, given any natural language query, the retriever uses a query-constructing LLM chain to write a structured query and then applies that structured query to its underlying VectorStore. This allows the retriever to not only use the user-input query for semantic similarity comparison with the contents of stored documents but to also extract filters from the user query on the metadata of stored documents and to execute those filters.

## Get started
For demonstration purposes we'll use a `Chroma` vector store. We've created a small demo set of documents that contain summaries of movies.

**Note:** The self-query retriever requires you to have `lark` package installed.


```python
%pip install --upgrade --quiet  lark langchain-chroma
```


```python
from langchain_chroma import Chroma
from langchain_core.documents import Document
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings

docs = [
    Document(
        page_content="A bunch of scientists bring back dinosaurs and mayhem breaks loose",
        metadata={"year": 1993, "rating": 7.7, "genre": "science fiction"},
    ),
    Document(
        page_content="Leo DiCaprio gets lost in a dream within a dream within a dream within a ...",
        metadata={"year": 2010, "director": "Christopher Nolan", "rating": 8.2},
    ),
    Document(
        page_content="A psychologist / detective gets lost in a series of dreams within dreams within dreams and Inception reused the idea",
        metadata={"year": 2006, "director": "Satoshi Kon", "rating": 8.6},
    ),
    Document(
        page_content="A bunch of normal-sized women are supremely wholesome and some men pine after them",
        metadata={"year": 2019, "director": "Greta Gerwig", "rating": 8.3},
    ),
    Document(
        page_content="Toys come alive and have a blast doing so",
        metadata={"year": 1995, "genre": "animated"},
    ),
    Document(
        page_content="Three men walk into the Zone, three men walk out of the Zone",
        metadata={
            "year": 1979,
            "director": "Andrei Tarkovsky",
            "genre": "thriller",
            "rating": 9.9,
        },
    ),
]
vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(docs, OpenAIEmbeddings())
```

### Creating our self-querying retriever

Now we can instantiate our retriever. To do this we'll need to provide some information upfront about the metadata fields that our documents support and a short description of the document contents.


```python
from langchain.chains.query_constructor.base import AttributeInfo
from langchain.retrievers.self_query.base import SelfQueryRetriever
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

metadata_field_info = [
    AttributeInfo(
        name="genre",
        description="The genre of the movie. One of ['science fiction', 'comedy', 'drama', 'thriller', 'romance', 'action', 'animated']",
        type="string",
    ),
    AttributeInfo(
        name="year",
        description="The year the movie was released",
        type="integer",
    ),
    AttributeInfo(
        name="director",
        description="The name of the movie director",
        type="string",
    ),
    AttributeInfo(
        name="rating", description="A 1-10 rating for the movie", type="float"
    ),
]
document_content_description = "Brief summary of a movie"
llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)
retriever = SelfQueryRetriever.from_llm(
    llm,
    vectorstore,
    document_content_description,
    metadata_field_info,
)
```

### Testing it out

And now we can actually try using our retriever!


```python
# This example only specifies a filter
retriever.invoke("I want to watch a movie rated higher than 8.5")
```




    [Document(page_content='Three men walk into the Zone, three men walk out of the Zone', metadata={'director': 'Andrei Tarkovsky', 'genre': 'thriller', 'rating': 9.9, 'year': 1979}),
     Document(page_content='A psychologist / detective gets lost in a series of dreams within dreams within dreams and Inception reused the idea', metadata={'director': 'Satoshi Kon', 'rating': 8.6, 'year': 2006})]




```python
# This example specifies a query and a filter
retriever.invoke("Has Greta Gerwig directed any movies about women")
```




    [Document(page_content='A bunch of normal-sized women are supremely wholesome and some men pine after them', metadata={'director': 'Greta Gerwig', 'rating': 8.3, 'year': 2019})]




```python
# This example specifies a composite filter
retriever.invoke("What's a highly rated (above 8.5) science fiction film?")
```




    [Document(page_content='A psychologist / detective gets lost in a series of dreams within dreams within dreams and Inception reused the idea', metadata={'director': 'Satoshi Kon', 'rating': 8.6, 'year': 2006}),
     Document(page_content='Three men walk into the Zone, three men walk out of the Zone', metadata={'director': 'Andrei Tarkovsky', 'genre': 'thriller', 'rating': 9.9, 'year': 1979})]




```python
# This example specifies a query and composite filter
retriever.invoke(
    "What's a movie after 1990 but before 2005 that's all about toys, and preferably is animated"
)
```




    [Document(page_content='Toys come alive and have a blast doing so', metadata={'genre': 'animated', 'year': 1995})]



### Filter k

We can also use the self query retriever to specify `k`: the number of documents to fetch.

We can do this by passing `enable_limit=True` to the constructor.


```python
retriever = SelfQueryRetriever.from_llm(
    llm,
    vectorstore,
    document_content_description,
    metadata_field_info,
    enable_limit=True,
)

# This example only specifies a relevant query
retriever.invoke("What are two movies about dinosaurs")
```




    [Document(page_content='A bunch of scientists bring back dinosaurs and mayhem breaks loose', metadata={'genre': 'science fiction', 'rating': 7.7, 'year': 1993}),
     Document(page_content='Toys come alive and have a blast doing so', metadata={'genre': 'animated', 'year': 1995})]



## Constructing from scratch with LCEL

To see what's going on under the hood, and to have more custom control, we can reconstruct our retriever from scratch.

First, we need to create a query-construction chain. This chain will take a user query and generated a `StructuredQuery` object which captures the filters specified by the user. We provide some helper functions for creating a prompt and output parser. These have a number of tunable params that we'll ignore here for simplicity.


```python
from langchain.chains.query_constructor.base import (
    StructuredQueryOutputParser,
    get_query_constructor_prompt,
)

prompt = get_query_constructor_prompt(
    document_content_description,
    metadata_field_info,
)
output_parser = StructuredQueryOutputParser.from_components()
query_constructor = prompt | llm | output_parser
```

Let's look at our prompt:


```python
print(prompt.format(query="dummy question"))
```

    Your goal is to structure the user's query to match the request schema provided below.
    
    << Structured Request Schema >>
    When responding use a markdown code snippet with a JSON object formatted in the following schema:
    
    ```json
    {
        "query": string \ text string to compare to document contents
        "filter": string \ logical condition statement for filtering documents
    }
    ```
    
    The query string should contain only text that is expected to match the contents of documents. Any conditions in the filter should not be mentioned in the query as well.
    
    A logical condition statement is composed of one or more comparison and logical operation statements.
    
    A comparison statement takes the form: `comp(attr, val)`:
    - `comp` (eq | ne | gt | gte | lt | lte | contain | like | in | nin): comparator
    - `attr` (string):  name of attribute to apply the comparison to
    - `val` (string): is the comparison value
    
    A logical operation statement takes the form `op(statement1, statement2, ...)`:
    - `op` (and | or | not): logical operator
    - `statement1`, `statement2`, ... (comparison statements or logical operation statements): one or more statements to apply the operation to
    
    Make sure that you only use the comparators and logical operators listed above and no others.
    Make sure that filters only refer to attributes that exist in the data source.
    Make sure that filters only use the attributed names with its function names if there are functions applied on them.
    Make sure that filters only use format `YYYY-MM-DD` when handling date data typed values.
    Make sure that filters take into account the descriptions of attributes and only make comparisons that are feasible given the type of data being stored.
    Make sure that filters are only used as needed. If there are no filters that should be applied return "NO_FILTER" for the filter value.
    
    << Example 1. >>
    Data Source:
    ```json
    {
        "content": "Lyrics of a song",
        "attributes": {
            "artist": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "Name of the song artist"
            },
            "length": {
                "type": "integer",
                "description": "Length of the song in seconds"
            },
            "genre": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The song genre, one of "pop", "rock" or "rap""
            }
        }
    }
    ```
    
    User Query:
    What are songs by Taylor Swift or Katy Perry about teenage romance under 3 minutes long in the dance pop genre
    
    Structured Request:
    ```json
    {
        "query": "teenager love",
        "filter": "and(or(eq(\"artist\", \"Taylor Swift\"), eq(\"artist\", \"Katy Perry\")), lt(\"length\", 180), eq(\"genre\", \"pop\"))"
    }
    ```
    
    
    << Example 2. >>
    Data Source:
    ```json
    {
        "content": "Lyrics of a song",
        "attributes": {
            "artist": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "Name of the song artist"
            },
            "length": {
                "type": "integer",
                "description": "Length of the song in seconds"
            },
            "genre": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The song genre, one of "pop", "rock" or "rap""
            }
        }
    }
    ```
    
    User Query:
    What are songs that were not published on Spotify
    
    Structured Request:
    ```json
    {
        "query": "",
        "filter": "NO_FILTER"
    }
    ```
    
    
    << Example 3. >>
    Data Source:
    ```json
    {
        "content": "Brief summary of a movie",
        "attributes": {
        "genre": {
            "description": "The genre of the movie. One of ['science fiction', 'comedy', 'drama', 'thriller', 'romance', 'action', 'animated']",
            "type": "string"
        },
        "year": {
            "description": "The year the movie was released",
            "type": "integer"
        },
        "director": {
            "description": "The name of the movie director",
            "type": "string"
        },
        "rating": {
            "description": "A 1-10 rating for the movie",
            "type": "float"
        }
    }
    }
    ```
    
    User Query:
    dummy question
    
    Structured Request:
    
    

And what our full chain produces:


```python
query_constructor.invoke(
    {
        "query": "What are some sci-fi movies from the 90's directed by Luc Besson about taxi drivers"
    }
)
```




    StructuredQuery(query='taxi driver', filter=Operation(operator=<Operator.AND: 'and'>, arguments=[Comparison(comparator=<Comparator.EQ: 'eq'>, attribute='genre', value='science fiction'), Operation(operator=<Operator.AND: 'and'>, arguments=[Comparison(comparator=<Comparator.GTE: 'gte'>, attribute='year', value=1990), Comparison(comparator=<Comparator.LT: 'lt'>, attribute='year', value=2000)]), Comparison(comparator=<Comparator.EQ: 'eq'>, attribute='director', value='Luc Besson')]), limit=None)



The query constructor is the key element of the self-query retriever. To make a great retrieval system you'll need to make sure your query constructor works well. Often this requires adjusting the prompt, the examples in the prompt, the attribute descriptions, etc. For an example that walks through refining a query constructor on some hotel inventory data, [check out this cookbook](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/blob/master/cookbook/self_query_hotel_search.ipynb).

The next key element is the structured query translator. This is the object responsible for translating the generic `StructuredQuery` object into a metadata filter in the syntax of the vector store you're using. LangChain comes with a number of built-in translators. To see them all head to the [Integrations section](/docs/integrations/retrievers/self_query).


```python
from langchain_community.query_constructors.chroma import ChromaTranslator

retriever = SelfQueryRetriever(
    query_constructor=query_constructor,
    vectorstore=vectorstore,
    structured_query_translator=ChromaTranslator(),
)
```


```python
retriever.invoke(
    "What's a movie after 1990 but before 2005 that's all about toys, and preferably is animated"
)
```




    [Document(page_content='Toys come alive and have a blast doing so', metadata={'genre': 'animated', 'year': 1995})]

# Building hotel room search with self-querying retrieval

In this example we'll walk through how to build and iterate on a hotel room search service that leverages an LLM to generate structured filter queries that can then be passed to a vector store.

For an introduction to self-querying retrieval [check out the docs](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/self_query).

## Imports and data prep

In this example we use `ChatOpenAI` for the model and `ElasticsearchStore` for the vector store, but these can be swapped out with an LLM/ChatModel and [any VectorStore that support self-querying](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/retrievers/self_query/).

## Describe data attributes

We'll use a self-query retriever, which requires us to describe the metadata we can filter on.

Or if we're feeling lazy we can have a model write a draft of the descriptions for us :)


```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4")
res = model.predict(
    "Below is a table with information about hotel rooms. "
    "Return a JSON list with an entry for each column. Each entry should have "
    '{"name": "column name", "description": "column description", "type": "column data type"}'
    f"\n\n{latest_price.head()}\n\nJSON:\n"
)
```


```python
import json

attribute_info = json.loads(res)
attribute_info
```




    [{'name': 'roomtype', 'description': 'The type of the room', 'type': 'string'},
     {'name': 'onsiterate',
      'description': 'The rate of the room',
      'type': 'float'},
     {'name': 'roomamenities',
      'description': 'Amenities available in the room',
      'type': 'string'},
     {'name': 'maxoccupancy',
      'description': 'Maximum number of people that can occupy the room',
      'type': 'integer'},
     {'name': 'roomdescription',
      'description': 'Description of the room',
      'type': 'string'},
     {'name': 'hotelname', 'description': 'Name of the hotel', 'type': 'string'},
     {'name': 'city',
      'description': 'City where the hotel is located',
      'type': 'string'},
     {'name': 'country',
      'description': 'Country where the hotel is located',
      'type': 'string'},
     {'name': 'starrating',
      'description': 'Star rating of the hotel',
      'type': 'integer'},
     {'name': 'mealsincluded',
      'description': 'Whether meals are included or not',
      'type': 'boolean'}]



For low cardinality features, let's include the valid values in the description


```python
latest_price.nunique()[latest_price.nunique() < 40]
```




    maxoccupancy     19
    country          29
    starrating        3
    mealsincluded     2
    dtype: int64




```python
attribute_info[-2]["description"] += (
    f". Valid values are {sorted(latest_price['starrating'].value_counts().index.tolist())}"
)
attribute_info[3]["description"] += (
    f". Valid values are {sorted(latest_price['maxoccupancy'].value_counts().index.tolist())}"
)
attribute_info[-3]["description"] += (
    f". Valid values are {sorted(latest_price['country'].value_counts().index.tolist())}"
)
```


```python
attribute_info
```




    [{'name': 'roomtype', 'description': 'The type of the room', 'type': 'string'},
     {'name': 'onsiterate',

## Creating a query constructor chain

Let's take a look at the chain that will convert natural language requests into structured queries.

To start we can just load the prompt and see what it looks like


```python
from langchain.chains.query_constructor.base import (
    get_query_constructor_prompt,
    load_query_constructor_runnable,
)
```


```python
doc_contents = "Detailed description of a hotel room"
prompt = get_query_constructor_prompt(doc_contents, attribute_info)
print(prompt.format(query="{query}"))
```

    Your goal is to structure the user's query to match the request schema provided below.
    
    << Structured Request Schema >>
    When responding use a markdown code snippet with a JSON object formatted in the following schema:
    
    ```json
    {
        "query": string \ text string to compare to document contents
        "filter": string \ logical condition statement for filtering documents
    }
    ```
    
    The query string should contain only text that is expected to match the contents of documents. Any conditions in the filter should not be mentioned in the query as well.
    
    A logical condition statement is composed of one or more comparison and logical operation statements.
    
    A comparison statement takes the form: `comp(attr, val)`:
    - `comp` (eq | ne | gt | gte | lt | lte | contain | like | in | nin): comparator
    - `attr` (string):  name of attribute to apply the comparison to
    - `val` (string): is the comparison value
    
    A logical operation statement takes the form `op(statement1, statement2, ...)`:
    - `op` (and | or | not): logical operator
    - `statement1`, `statement2`, ... (comparison statements or logical operation statements): one or more statements to apply the operation to
    
    Make sure that you only use the comparators and logical operators listed above and no others.
    Make sure that filters only refer to attributes that exist in the data source.
    Make sure that filters only use the attributed names with its function names if there are functions applied on them.
    Make sure that filters only use format `YYYY-MM-DD` when handling timestamp data typed values.
    Make sure that filters take into account the descriptions of attributes and only make comparisons that are feasible given the type of data being stored.
    Make sure that filters are only used as needed. If there are no filters that should be applied return "NO_FILTER" for the filter value.

    }
    ```
    
    User Query:
    {query}
    
    Structured Request:
    
    


```python
chain = load_query_constructor_runnable(
    ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", temperature=0), doc_contents, attribute_info
)
```


```python
chain.invoke({"query": "I want a hotel in Southern Europe and my budget is 200 bucks."})
```




    StructuredQuery(query='hotel', filter=Operation(operator=<Operator.AND: 'and'>, arguments=[Comparison(comparator=<Comparator.EQ: 'eq'>, attribute='country', value='Italy'), Comparison(comparator=<Comparator.LTE: 'lte'>, attribute='onsiterate', value=200)]), limit=None)




```python
chain.invoke(
    {
        "query": "Find a 2-person room in Vienna or London, preferably with meals included and AC"
    }
)
```




    StructuredQuery(query='2-person room', filter=Operation(operator=<Operator.AND: 'and'>, arguments=[Operation(operator=<Operator.OR: 'or'>, arguments=[Comparison(comparator=<Comparator.EQ: 'eq'>, attribute='city', value='Vienna'), Comparison(comparator=<Comparator.EQ: 'eq'>, attribute='city', value='London')]), Comparison(comparator=<Comparator.EQ: 'eq'>, attribute='maxoccupancy', value=2), Comparison(comparator=<Comparator.EQ: 'eq'>, attribute='mealsincluded', value=True), Comparison(comparator=<Comparator.CONTAIN: 'contain'>, attribute='roomamenities', value='AC')]), limit=None)



## Refining attribute descriptions

We can see that at least two issues above. First is that when we ask for a Southern European destination we're only getting a filter for Italy, and second when we ask for AC we get a literal string lookup for AC (which isn't so bad but will miss things like 'Air conditioning').

As a first step, let's try to update our description of the 'country' attribute to emphasize that equality should only be used when a specific country is mentioned.


```python
attribute_info[-3]["description"] += (
    ". NOTE: Only use the 'eq' operator if a specific country is mentioned. If a region is mentioned, include all relevant countries in filter."
)
chain = load_query_constructor_runnable(
    ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", temperature=0),
    doc_contents,
    attribute_info,
)
```


```python
chain.invoke({"query": "I want a hotel in Southern Europe and my budget is 200 bucks."})
```




    StructuredQuery(query='hotel', filter=Operation(operator=<Operator.AND: 'and'>, arguments=[Comparison(comparator=<Comparator.EQ: 'eq'>, attribute='mealsincluded', value=False), Comparison(comparator=<Comparator.LTE: 'lte'>, attribute='onsiterate', value=200), Operation(operator=<Operator.OR: 'or'>, arguments=[Comparison(comparator=<Comparator.EQ: 'eq'>, attribute='country', value='Italy'), Comparison(comparator=<Comparator.EQ: 'eq'>, attribute='country', value='Spain'), Comparison(comparator=<Comparator.EQ: 'eq'>, attribute='country', value='Greece'), Comparison(comparator=<Comparator.EQ: 'eq'>, attribute='country', value='Portugal'), Comparison(comparator=<Comparator.EQ: 'eq'>, attribute='country', value='Croatia'), Comparison(comparator=<Comparator.EQ: 'eq'>, attribute='country', value='Cyprus'), Comparison(comparator=<Comparator.EQ: 'eq'>, attribute='country', value='Malta'), Comparison(comparator=<Comparator.EQ: 'eq'>, attribute='country', value='Bulgaria'), Comparison(comparator=<Comparator.EQ: 'eq'>, attribute='country', value='Romania'), Comparison(comparator=<Comparator.EQ: 'eq'>, attribute='country', value='Slovenia'), Comparison(comparator=<Comparator.EQ: 'eq'>, attribute='country', value='Czech Republic'), Comparison(comparator=<Comparator.EQ: 'eq'>, attribute='country', value='Slovakia'), Comparison(comparator=<Comparator.EQ: 'eq'>, attribute='country', value='Hungary'), Comparison(comparator=<Comparator.EQ: 'eq'>, attribute='country', value='Poland'), Comparison(comparator=<Comparator.EQ: 'eq'>, attribute='country', value='Estonia'), Comparison(comparator=<Comparator.EQ: 'eq'>, attribute='country', value='Latvia'), Comparison(comparator=<Comparator.EQ: 'eq'>, attribute='country', value='Lithuania')])]), limit=None)



## Refining which attributes to filter on

This seems to have helped! Now let's try to narrow the attributes we're filtering on. More freeform attributes we can leave to the main query, which is better for capturing semantic meaning than searching for specific substrings.


```python
content_attr = ["roomtype", "roomamenities", "roomdescription", "hotelname"]
doc_contents = "A detailed description of a hotel room, including information about the room type and room amenities."
filter_attribute_info = tuple(
    ai for ai in attribute_info if ai["name"] not in content_attr
)
chain = load_query_constructor_runnable(
    ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", temperature=0),
    doc_contents,
    filter_attribute_info,
)
```


```python
chain.invoke(
    {
        "query": "Find a 2-person room in Vienna or London, preferably with meals included and AC"
    }
)
```




    StructuredQuery(query='2-person room', filter=Operation(operator=<Operator.AND: 'and'>, arguments=[Operation(operator=<Operator.OR: 'or'>, arguments=[Comparison(comparator=<Comparator.EQ: 'eq'>, attribute='city', value='Vienna'), Comparison(comparator=<Comparator.EQ: 'eq'>, attribute='city', value='London')]), Comparison(comparator=<Comparator.EQ: 'eq'>, attribute='maxoccupancy', value=2), Comparison(comparator=<Comparator.EQ: 'eq'>, attribute='mealsincluded', value=True)]), limit=None)



## Adding examples specific to our use case

We've removed the strict filter for 'AC' but it's still not being included in the query string. Our chain prompt is a few-shot prompt with some default examples. Let's see if adding use case-specific examples will help:


```python
examples = [
    (
        "I want a hotel in the Balkans with a king sized bed and a hot tub. Budget is $300 a night",
        {
            "query": "king-sized bed, hot tub",
            "filter": 'and(in("country", ["Bulgaria", "Greece", "Croatia", "Serbia"]), lte("onsiterate", 300))',
        },
    ),
    (
        "A room with breakfast included for 3 people, at a Hilton",
        {
            "query": "Hilton",
            "filter": 'and(eq("mealsincluded", true), gte("maxoccupancy", 3))',
        },
    ),
]
prompt = get_query_constructor_prompt(
    doc_contents, filter_attribute_info, examples=examples
)
print(prompt.format(query="{query}"))
```

    Your goal is to structure the user's query to match the request schema provided below.
    
    << Structured Request Schema >>
    When responding use a markdown code snippet with a JSON object formatted in the following schema:

## Automatically ignoring invalid queries

It seems our model get's tripped up on this more complex query and tries to search over an attribute ('description') that doesn't exist. By setting `fix_invalid=True` in our query constructor chain, we can automatically remove any parts of the filter that is invalid (meaning it's using disallowed operations, comparisons or attributes).


```python
chain = load_query_constructor_runnable(
    ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", temperature=0),
    doc_contents,
    filter_attribute_info,
    examples=examples,
    fix_invalid=True,
)
```


```python
chain.invoke(
    {
        "query": "I want to stay somewhere highly rated along the coast. I want a room with a patio and a fireplace."
    }
)
```




    StructuredQuery(query='highly rated, coast, patio, fireplace', filter=Comparison(comparator=<Comparator.EQ: 'eq'>, attribute='starrating', value=4), limit=None)



## Using with a self-querying retriever

Now that our query construction chain is in a decent place, let's try using it with an actual retriever. For this example we'll use the [ElasticsearchStore](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/elasticsearch).


```python
from langchain_elasticsearch import ElasticsearchStore
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings

embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
```

## Populating vectorstore

The first time you run this, uncomment the below cell to first index the data.


```python
# docs = []
# for _, room in latest_price.fillna("").iterrows():
#     doc = Document(
#         page_content=json.dumps(room.to_dict(), indent=2),
#         metadata=room.to_dict()
#     )
#     docs.append(doc)
# vecstore = ElasticsearchStore.from_documents(
#     docs,
#     embeddings,
#     es_url="http://localhost:9200",
#     index_name="hotel_rooms",
#     # strategy=ElasticsearchStore.ApproxRetrievalStrategy(
#     #     hybrid=True,
#     # )
# )
```


```python
vecstore = ElasticsearchStore(
    "hotel_rooms",
    embedding=embeddings,
    es_url="http://localhost:9200",
    # strategy=ElasticsearchStore.ApproxRetrievalStrategy(hybrid=True) # seems to not be available in community version
)
```


```python
from langchain.retrievers import SelfQueryRetriever

retriever = SelfQueryRetriever(
    query_constructor=chain, vectorstore=vecstore, verbose=True
)
```


```python
results = retriever.invoke(
    "I want to stay somewhere highly rated along the coast. I want a room with a patio and a fireplace."
)
for res in results:
    print(res.page_content)
    print("\n" + "-" * 20 + "\n")
```

# Self-RAG: A Dynamic Approach to Retrieval-Augmented Generation

## Overview

Self-RAG is an advanced algorithm that combines the power of retrieval-based and generation-based approaches in natural language processing. It dynamically decides whether to use retrieved information and how to best utilize it in generating responses, aiming to produce more accurate, relevant, and useful outputs.

## Motivation

Traditional question-answering systems often struggle with balancing the use of retrieved information and the generation of new content. Some systems might rely too heavily on retrieved data, leading to responses that lack flexibility, while others might generate responses without sufficient grounding in factual information. Self-RAG addresses these issues by implementing a multi-step process that carefully evaluates the necessity and relevance of retrieved information, and assesses the quality of generated responses.

## Key Components

1. **Retrieval Decision**: Determines if retrieval is necessary for a given query.
2. **Document Retrieval**: Fetches potentially relevant documents from a vector store.
3. **Relevance Evaluation**: Assesses the relevance of retrieved documents to the query.
4. **Response Generation**: Generates responses based on relevant contexts.
5. **Support Assessment**: Evaluates how well the generated response is supported by the context.
6. **Utility Evaluation**: Rates the usefulness of the generated response.

## Method Details

1. **Retrieval Decision**: The algorithm first decides if retrieval is necessary for the given query. This step prevents unnecessary retrieval for queries that can be answered directly.

2. **Document Retrieval**: If retrieval is deemed necessary, the algorithm fetches the top-k most similar documents from a vector store.

3. **Relevance Evaluation**: Each retrieved document is evaluated for its relevance to the query. This step filters out irrelevant information, ensuring that only pertinent context is used for generation.

4. **Response Generation**: The algorithm generates responses using the relevant contexts. If no relevant contexts are found, it generates a response without retrieval.

5. **Support Assessment**: Each generated response is evaluated to determine how well it is supported by the context. This step helps in identifying responses that are grounded in the provided information.

6. **Utility Evaluation**: The utility of each response is rated, considering how well it addresses the original query.

7. **Response Selection**: The final step involves selecting the best response based on the support assessment and utility evaluation.

## Benefits of the Approach

1. **Dynamic Retrieval**: By deciding whether retrieval is necessary, the system can adapt to different types of queries efficiently.

2. **Relevance Filtering**: The relevance evaluation step ensures that only pertinent information is used, reducing noise in the generation process.

3. **Quality Assurance**: The support assessment and utility evaluation provide a way to gauge the quality of generated responses.

4. **Flexibility**: The system can generate responses with or without retrieval, adapting to the available information.

5. **Improved Accuracy**: By grounding responses in relevant retrieved information and assessing their support, the system can produce more accurate outputs.

## Conclusion

Self-RAG represents a sophisticated approach to question-answering and information retrieval tasks. By incorporating multiple evaluation steps and dynamically deciding on the use of retrieved information, it aims to produce responses that are not only relevant and accurate but also useful to the end-user. This method showcases the potential of combining retrieval and generation techniques in a thoughtful, evaluated manner to enhance the quality of AI-generated responses.

### Import relevant libraries


```python
import os
import sys
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_core.pydantic_v1 import BaseModel, Field


sys.path.append(os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.getcwd(), '..'))) # Add the parent directory to the path sicnce we work with notebooks
from helper_functions import *
from evaluation.evalute_rag import *

# Load environment variables from a .env file
load_dotenv()

# Set the OpenAI API key environment variable
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')
```

### Define files path


```python
path = "../data/Understanding_Climate_Change.pdf"
```

### Create a vector store 


```python
vectorstore = encode_pdf(path)
```

### Initialize the language model



```python
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini", max_tokens=1000, temperature=0)
```

### Defining prompt templates


```python
class RetrievalResponse(BaseModel):
    response: str = Field(..., title="Determines if retrieval is necessary", description="Output only 'Yes' or 'No'.")
retrieval_prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["query"],
    template="Given the query '{query}', determine if retrieval is necessary. Output only 'Yes' or 'No'."
)

class RelevanceResponse(BaseModel):
    response: str = Field(..., title="Determines if context is relevant", description="Output only 'Relevant' or 'Irrelevant'.")
relevance_prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["query", "context"],
    template="Given the query '{query}' and the context '{context}', determine if the context is relevant. Output only 'Relevant' or 'Irrelevant'."
)

class GenerationResponse(BaseModel):
    response: str = Field(..., title="Generated response", description="The generated response.")
generation_prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["query", "context"],
    template="Given the query '{query}' and the context '{context}', generate a response."
)

class SupportResponse(BaseModel):
    response: str = Field(..., title="Determines if response is supported", description="Output 'Fully supported', 'Partially supported', or 'No support'.")
support_prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["response", "context"],
    template="Given the response '{response}' and the context '{context}', determine if the response is supported by the context. Output 'Fully supported', 'Partially supported', or 'No support'."
)

class UtilityResponse(BaseModel):
    response: int = Field(..., title="Utility rating", description="Rate the utility of the response from 1 to 5.")
utility_prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["query", "response"],
    template="Given the query '{query}' and the response '{response}', rate the utility of the response from 1 to 5."
)

# Create LLMChains for each step
retrieval_chain = retrieval_prompt | llm.with_structured_output(RetrievalResponse)
relevance_chain = relevance_prompt | llm.with_structured_output(RelevanceResponse)
generation_chain = generation_prompt | llm.with_structured_output(GenerationResponse)
support_chain = support_prompt | llm.with_structured_output(SupportResponse)
utility_chain = utility_prompt | llm.with_structured_output(UtilityResponse)
```

### Defining the self RAG logic flow

    input_data = {"query": query}
    retrieval_decision = retrieval_chain.invoke(input_data).response.strip().lower()
    print(f"Retrieval decision: {retrieval_decision}")
    
    if retrieval_decision == 'yes':

        print("Step 2: Retrieving relevant documents...")
        docs = vectorstore.similarity_search(query, k=top_k)
        contexts = [doc.page_content for doc in docs]
        print(f"Retrieved {len(contexts)} documents")
        
        # Step 3: Evaluate relevance of retrieved documents
        print("Step 3: Evaluating relevance of retrieved documents...")
        relevant_contexts = []
        for i, context in enumerate(contexts):

# SemaDB

> [SemaDB](https://www.semafind.com/products/semadb) from [SemaFind](https://www.semafind.com) is a no fuss vector similarity database for building AI applications. The hosted `SemaDB Cloud` offers a no fuss developer experience to get started.

The full documentation of the API along with examples and an interactive playground is available on [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/semafind-semadb/api/semadb).

This notebook demonstrates usage of the `SemaDB Cloud` vector store.

You'll need to install `langchain-community` with `pip install -qU langchain-community` to use this integration

## Load document embeddings

To run things locally, we are using [Sentence Transformers](https://www.sbert.net/) which are commonly used for embedding sentences. You can use any embedding model LangChain offers.


```python
%pip install --upgrade --quiet  sentence_transformers
```


```python
from langchain_huggingface import HuggingFaceEmbeddings

model_name = "sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2"
embeddings = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name=model_name)
```


```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import TextLoader
from langchain_text_splitters import CharacterTextSplitter

loader = TextLoader("../../how_to/state_of_the_union.txt")
documents = loader.load()
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=400, chunk_overlap=0)
docs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)
print(len(docs))
```

    114
    

## Connect to SemaDB

SemaDB Cloud uses [RapidAPI keys](https://rapidapi.com/semafind-semadb/api/semadb) to authenticate. You can obtain yours by creating a free RapidAPI account.


```python
import getpass
import os

if "SEMADB_API_KEY" not in os.environ:
    os.environ["SEMADB_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("SemaDB API Key:")
```

    SemaDB API Key: ········
    


```python
from langchain_community.vectorstores import SemaDB
from langchain_community.vectorstores.utils import DistanceStrategy
```

The parameters to the SemaDB vector store reflect the API directly:

- "mycollection": is the collection name in which we will store these vectors.
- 768: is dimensions of the vectors. In our case, the sentence transformer embeddings yield 768 dimensional vectors.
- API_KEY: is your RapidAPI key.
- embeddings: correspond to how the embeddings of documents, texts and queries will be generated.
- DistanceStrategy: is the distance metric used. The wrapper automatically normalises vectors if COSINE is used.


```python
db = SemaDB("mycollection", 768, embeddings, DistanceStrategy.COSINE)

# Create collection if running for the first time. If the collection
# already exists this will fail.
db.create_collection()
```




    True



The SemaDB vector store wrapper adds the document text as point metadata to collect later. Storing large chunks of text is *not recommended*. If you are indexing a large collection, we instead recommend storing references to the documents such as external Ids.


```python
db.add_documents(docs)[:2]
```




    ['813c7ef3-9797-466b-8afa-587115592c6c',
     'fc392f7f-082b-4932-bfcc-06800db5e017']



## Similarity Search

We use the default LangChain similarity search interface to search for the most similar sentences.


```python
query = "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"
docs = db.similarity_search(query)
print(docs[0].page_content)
```

    And I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation’s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence.
    


```python
docs = db.similarity_search_with_score(query)
docs[0]
```




    (Document(page_content='And I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation’s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence.', metadata={'source': '../../how_to/state_of_the_union.txt', 'text': 'And I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation’s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence.'}),
     0.42369342)



## Clean up

You can delete the collection to remove all data.


```python
db.delete_collection()
```




    True




```python

```

# How to split text based on semantic similarity

Taken from Greg Kamradt's wonderful notebook:
[5_Levels_Of_Text_Splitting](https://github.com/FullStackRetrieval-com/RetrievalTutorials/blob/main/tutorials/LevelsOfTextSplitting/5_Levels_Of_Text_Splitting.ipynb)

All credit to him.

This guide covers how to split chunks based on their semantic similarity. If embeddings are sufficiently far apart, chunks are split.

At a high level, this splits into sentences, then groups into groups of 3
sentences, and then merges one that are similar in the embedding space.

## Install Dependencies


```python
!pip install --quiet langchain_experimental langchain_openai
```

## Load Example Data


```python
# This is a long document we can split up.
with open("state_of_the_union.txt") as f:
    state_of_the_union = f.read()
```

## Create Text Splitter

To instantiate a [SemanticChunker](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/experimental/text_splitter/langchain_experimental.text_splitter.SemanticChunker.html), we must specify an embedding model. Below we will use [OpenAIEmbeddings](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/embeddings/langchain_community.embeddings.openai.OpenAIEmbeddings.html). 


```python
from langchain_experimental.text_splitter import SemanticChunker
from langchain_openai.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings

text_splitter = SemanticChunker(OpenAIEmbeddings())
```

## Split Text

We split text in the usual way, e.g., by invoking `.create_documents` to create LangChain [Document](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/core/documents/langchain_core.documents.base.Document.html) objects:


```python
docs = text_splitter.create_documents([state_of_the_union])
print(docs[0].page_content)
```

    Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans. Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. Six days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. He met the Ukrainian people. From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland. In this struggle as President Zelenskyy said in his speech to the European Parliament “Light will win over darkness.” The Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States is here tonight. Let each of us here tonight in this Chamber send an unmistakable signal to Ukraine and to the world. Please rise if you are able and show that, Yes, we the United States of America stand with the Ukrainian people. Throughout our history we’ve learned this lesson when dictators do not pay a price for their aggression they cause more chaos. They keep moving.
    

## Breakpoints

This chunker works by determining when to "break" apart sentences. This is done by looking for differences in embeddings between any two sentences. When that difference is past some threshold, then they are split.

There are a few ways to determine what that threshold is, which are controlled by the `breakpoint_threshold_type` kwarg.

### Percentile

The default way to split is based on percentile. In this method, all differences between sentences are calculated, and then any difference greater than the X percentile is split.


```python
text_splitter = SemanticChunker(
    OpenAIEmbeddings(), breakpoint_threshold_type="percentile"
)
```


```python
docs = text_splitter.create_documents([state_of_the_union])
print(docs[0].page_content)
```

### Standard Deviation

In this method, any difference greater than X standard deviations is split.


```python
text_splitter = SemanticChunker(
    OpenAIEmbeddings(), breakpoint_threshold_type="standard_deviation"
)
```


```python
docs = text_splitter.create_documents([state_of_the_union])

Let each of us here tonight in this Chamber send an unmistakable signal to Ukraine and to the world. Please rise if you are able and show that, Yes, we the United States of America stand with the Ukrainian people. Throughout our history we’ve learned this lesson when dictators do not pay a price for their aggression they cause more chaos. They keep moving. And the costs and the threats to America and the world keep rising. That’s why the NATO Alliance was created to secure peace and stability in Europe after World War 2. The United States is a member along with 29 other nations. It matters. American diplomacy matters. American resolve matters. Putin’s latest attack on Ukraine was premeditated and unprovoked. He rejected repeated efforts at diplomacy. He thought the West and NATO wouldn’t respond. And he thought he could divide us at home. Putin was wrong. We were ready. Here is what we did. We prepared extensively and carefully. We spent months building a coalition of other freedom-loving nations from Europe and the Americas to Asia and Africa to confront Putin. I spent countless hours unifying our European allies. We shared with the world in advance what we knew Putin was planning and precisely how he would try to falsely justify his aggression. We countered Russia’s lies with truth. And now that he has acted the free world is holding him accountable. Along with twenty-seven members of the European Union including France, Germany, Italy, as well as countries like the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, and many others, even Switzerland. We are inflicting pain on Russia and supporting the people of Ukraine. Putin is now isolated from the world more than ever. Together with our allies –we are right now enforcing powerful economic sanctions. We are cutting off Russia’s largest banks from the international financial system. Preventing Russia’s central bank from defending the Russian Ruble making Putin’s $630 Billion “war fund” worthless. We are choking off Russia’s access to technology that will sap its economic strength and weaken its military for years to come. Tonight I say to the Russian oligarchs and corrupt leaders who have bilked billions of dollars off this violent regime no more. The U.S. Department of Justice is assembling a dedicated task force to go after the crimes of Russian oligarchs. We are joining with our European allies to find and seize your yachts your luxury apartments your private jets. We are coming for your ill-begotten gains. And tonight I am announcing that we will join our allies in closing off American air space to all Russian flights – further isolating Russia – and adding an additional squeeze –on their economy. The Ruble has lost 30% of its value. The Russian stock market has lost 40% of its value and trading remains suspended. Russia’s economy is reeling and Putin alone is to blame. Together with our allies we are providing support to the Ukrainians in their fight for freedom. Military assistance. Economic assistance. Humanitarian assistance. We are giving more than $1 Billion in direct assistance to Ukraine. And we will continue to aid the Ukrainian people as they defend their country and to help ease their suffering. Let me be clear, our forces are not engaged and will not engage in conflict with Russian forces in Ukraine. Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine, but to defend our NATO Allies – in the event that Putin decides to keep moving west. For that purpose we’ve mobilized American ground forces, air squadrons, and ship deployments to protect NATO countries including Poland, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. As I have made crystal clear the United States and our Allies will defend every inch of territory of NATO countries with the full force of our collective power. And we remain clear-eyed. The Ukrainians are fighting back with pure courage. But the next few days weeks, months, will be hard on them. Putin has unleashed violence and chaos. But while he may make gains on the battlefield – he will pay a continuing high price over the long run. And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards. To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. And I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world. America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies. These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming.

### Interquartile

In this method, the interquartile distance is used to split chunks.


```python
text_splitter = SemanticChunker(
    OpenAIEmbeddings(), breakpoint_threshold_type="interquartile"
)
```


```python
docs = text_splitter.create_documents([state_of_the_union])
print(docs[0].page_content)

```

### Gradient

In this method, the gradient of distance is used to split chunks along with the percentile method.
This method is useful when chunks are highly correlated with each other or specific to a domain e.g. legal or medical. The idea is to apply anomaly detection on gradient array so that the distribution become wider and easy to identify boundaries in highly semantic data.


```python
text_splitter = SemanticChunker(
    OpenAIEmbeddings(), breakpoint_threshold_type="gradient"
)
```


```python
docs = text_splitter.create_documents([state_of_the_union])
print(docs[0].page_content)

    Title: Biases in Large Language Models: Origins, Inventory, and Discussion
    Authors: Roberto Navigli, Simone Conia, Björn Ross
    Astract: In this article, we introduce and discuss the pervasive issue of bias in the large language models that are currently at the core of mainstream approaches to Natural Language Processing (NLP). We first introduce data selection bias, that is, the bias caused by the choice of texts that make up a training corpus. Then, we survey the different types of social bias evidenced in the text generated by language models trained on such corpora, ranging from gender to age, from sexual orientation to ethnicity, and from religion to culture. We conclude with directions focused on measuring, reducing, and tackling the aforementioned types of bias.

    Title: Surfacing Biases in Large Language Models using Contrastive Input Decoding
    Authors: G. Yona, Or Honovich, Itay Laish, Roee Aharoni
    Astract: Ensuring that large language models (LMs) are fair, robust and useful requires an understanding of how different modifications to their inputs impact the model's behaviour. In the context of open-text generation tasks, however, such an evaluation is not trivial. For example, when introducing a model with an input text and a perturbed,"contrastive"version of it, meaningful differences in the next-token predictions may not be revealed with standard decoding strategies. With this motivation in mind, we propose Contrastive Input Decoding (CID): a decoding algorithm to generate text given two inputs, where the generated text is likely given one input but unlikely given the other. In this way, the contrastive generations can highlight potentially subtle differences in how the LM output differs for the two inputs in a simple and interpretable manner. We use CID to highlight context-specific biases that are hard to detect with standard decoding strategies and quantify the effect of different input perturbations.

    Title: Benchmarking Cognitive Biases in Large Language Models as Evaluators
    Authors: Ryan Koo, Minhwa Lee, Vipul Raheja, Jong Inn Park, Zae Myung Kim, Dongyeop Kang
    Astract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been shown to be effective as automatic evaluators with simple prompting and in-context learning. In this work, we assemble 15 LLMs of four different size ranges and evaluate their output responses by preference ranking from the other LLMs as evaluators, such as System Star is better than System Square. We then evaluate the quality of ranking outputs introducing the Cognitive Bias Benchmark for LLMs as Evaluators (CoBBLEr), a benchmark to measure six different cognitive biases in LLM evaluation outputs, such as the Egocentric bias where a model prefers to rank its own outputs highly in evaluation. We find that LLMs are biased text quality evaluators, exhibiting strong indications on our bias benchmark (average of 40% of comparisons across all models) within each of their evaluations that question their robustness as evaluators. Furthermore, we examine the correlation between human and machine preferences and calculate the average Rank-Biased Overlap (RBO) score to be 49.6%, indicating that machine preferences are misaligned with humans. According to our findings, LLMs may still be unable to be utilized for automatic annotation aligned with human preferences.

    Title: Should ChatGPT be Biased? Challenges and Risks of Bias in Large Language Models
    Authors: Emilio Ferrara
    Astract: As generative language models, exemplified by ChatGPT, continue to advance in their capabilities, the spotlight on biases inherent in these models intensifies. This paper delves into the distinctive challenges and risks associated with biases specifically in large-scale language models. We explore the origins of biases, stemming from factors such as training data, model specifications, algorithmic constraints, product design, and policy decisions. Our examination extends to the ethical implications arising from the unintended consequences of biased model outputs. In addition, we analyze the intricacies of mitigating biases, acknowledging the inevitable persistence of some biases, and consider the consequences of deploying these models across diverse applications, including virtual assistants, content generation, and chatbots. Finally, we provide an overview of current approaches for identifying, quantifying, and mitigating biases in language models, underscoring the need for a collaborative, multidisciplinary effort to craft AI systems that embody equity, transparency, and responsibility. This article aims to catalyze a thoughtful discourse within the AI community, prompting researchers and developers to consider the unique role of biases in the domain of generative language models and the ongoing quest for ethical AI.

    Title: Towards Understanding and Mitigating Social Biases in Language Models
    Authors: P. Liang, Chiyu Wu, Louis-Philippe Morency, R. Salakhutdinov
    Astract: As machine learning methods are deployed in real-world settings such as healthcare, legal systems, and social science, it is crucial to recognize how they shape social biases and stereotypes in these sensitive decision-making processes. Among such real-world deployments are large-scale pretrained language models (LMs) that can be potentially dangerous in manifesting undesirable representational biases - harmful biases resulting from stereotyping that propagate negative generalizations involving gender, race, religion, and other social constructs. As a step towards improving the fairness of LMs, we carefully define several sources of representational biases before proposing new benchmarks and metrics to measure them. With these tools, we propose steps towards mitigating social biases during text generation. Our empirical results and human evaluation demonstrate effectiveness in mitigating bias while retaining crucial contextual information for high-fidelity text generation, thereby pushing forward the performance-fairness Pareto frontier.

    Title: In-Contextual Bias Suppression for Large Language Models
    Authors: Daisuke Oba, Masahiro Kaneko, D. Bollegala
    Astract: Despite their impressive performance in a wide range of NLP tasks, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been reported to encode worrying-levels of gender bias. Prior work has proposed debiasing methods that require human labelled examples, data augmentation and fine-tuning of the LLMs, which are computationally costly. Moreover, one might not even have access to the internal parameters for performing debiasing such as in the case of commercially available LLMs such as GPT-4. To address this challenge we propose bias suppression, a novel alternative to debiasing that does not require access to model parameters. We show that text-based preambles, generated from manually designed templates covering counterfactual statements, can accurately suppress gender biases in LLMs. Moreover, we find that descriptive sentences for occupations can further suppress gender biases. Interestingly, we find that bias suppression has a minimal adverse effect on downstream task performance, while effectively mitigating the gender biases.

# Implementing semantic cache to improve a RAG system with FAISS.

_Authored by:[Pere Martra](https://github.com/peremartra)_

In this notebook, we will explore a typical RAG solution where we will utilize an open-source model and the vector database Chroma DB. **However, we will integrate a semantic cache system that will store various user queries and decide whether to generate the prompt enriched with information from the vector database or the cache.**

A semantic caching system aims to identify similar or identical user requests. When a matching request is found, the system retrieves the corresponding information from the cache, reducing the need to fetch it from the original source.

As the comparison takes into account the semantic meaning of the requests, they don't have to be identical for the system to recognize them as the same question.  They can be formulated differently or contain inaccuracies, be they typographical or in the sentence structure, and we can identify that the user is actually requesting the same information.

For instance, queries like **What is the capital of France?**, **Tell me the name of the capital of France?**, and **What The capital of France is?** all convey the same intent and should be identified as the same question.

While the model's response may differ based on the request for a concise answer in the second example, the information retrieved from the vector database should be the same. This is why I'm placing the cache system between the user and the vector database, not between the user and the Large Language Model.


<img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/cookbook-images/resolve/main/semantic_cache.jpg">


Most tutorials that guide you through creating a RAG system are designed for single-user use, meant to operate in a testing environment. In other words, within a notebook, interacting with a local vector database and making API calls or using a locally stored model.

This architecture quickly becomes insufficient when attempting to transition one of these models to production, where they might encounter from tens to thousands of recurrent requests.

One way to enhance performance is through one or multiple semantic caches. This cache retains the results of previous requests, and before resolving a new request, it checks if a similar one has been received before. If so, instead of re-executing the process, it retrieves the information from the cache.

In a RAG system, there are two points that are time consuming:
* Retrieve the information used to construct the enriched prompt:
* Call the Large Language Model to obtain the response.

In both points, a semantic cache system can be implemented, and we could even have two caches, one for each point.

Placing it at the model's response point may lead to a loss of influence over the obtained response. Our cache system could consider "Explain the French Revolution in 10 words" and "Explain the French Revolution in a hundred words" as the same query. If our cache system stores model responses, users might think that their instructions are not being followed accurately.

But both requests will require the same information to enrich the prompt. This is the main reason why I chose to place the semantic cache system between the user's request and the retrieval of information from the vector database.

However, this is a design decision. Depending on the type of responses and system requests, it can be placed at one point or another. It's evident that caching model responses would yield the most time savings, but as I've already explained, it comes at the cost of losing user influence over the response.


# Import and load the libraries.
To start we need to install the necesary Python packages.
* **[sentence transformers](https://www.sbert.net/)**. This library is necessary to transform the sentences into fixed-length vectors, also know as embeddings.
* **[xformers](https://github.com/facebookresearch/xformers)**. it's a package that provides libraries an utilities to facilitate the work with transformers models. We need to install in order to avoid an error when we work with the model and embeddings.  
* **[chromadb](https://www.trychroma.com/)**. This is our vector Database. ChromaDB is easy to use and open source, maybe the most used Vector Database used to store embeddings.
* **[accelerate](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate)** Necesary to run the Model in a GPU.  


```python
!pip install -q transformers==4.38.1
!pip install -q accelerate==0.27.2
!pip install -q sentence-transformers==2.5.1
!pip install -q xformers==0.0.24
!pip install -q chromadb==0.4.24
!pip install -q datasets==2.17.1
```


```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
```

# Load the Dataset
As we are working in a free and limited space, and we can use just a few GB of memory I limited the number of rows to use from the Dataset with the variable `MAX_ROWS`.


```python
#Login to Hugging Face. It is mandatory to use the Gemma Model,
#and recommended to acces public models and Datasets.
from getpass import getpass
if 'hf_key' not in locals():
  hf_key = getpass("Your Hugging Face API Key: ")
!huggingface-cli login --token $hf_key
```


```python
from datasets import load_dataset

data = load_dataset("keivalya/MedQuad-MedicalQnADataset", split='train')
```

ChromaDB requires that the data has a unique identifier. We can make it with this statement, which will create a new column called **Id**.



```python
data = data.to_pandas()
data["id"]=data.index
data.head(10)
```

```python
MAX_ROWS = 15000
DOCUMENT="Answer"
TOPIC="qtype"
```


```python
#Because it is just a sample we select a small portion of News.
subset_data = data.head(MAX_ROWS)
```

# Import and configure the Vector Database
To store the information, I've chosen to use ChromaDB, one of the most well-known and widely used open-source vector databases.

First we need to import ChromaDB.


```python
import chromadb
```

Now we only need to indicate the path where the vector database will be stored.


```python
chroma_client = chromadb.PersistentClient(path="/path/to/persist/directory")
```

# Filling and Querying the ChromaDB Database
The Data in ChromaDB is stored in collections. If the collection exist we need to delete it.

In the next lines, we are creating the collection by calling the `create_collection` function in the `chroma_client` created above.


```python
collection_name = "news_collection"
if len(chroma_client.list_collections()) > 0 and collection_name in [chroma_client.list_collections()[0].name]:
    chroma_client.delete_collection(name=collection_name)

collection = chroma_client.create_collection(name=collection_name)

```

We are now ready to add the data to the collection using the `add` function. This function requires three key pieces of information:

* In the **document** we store the content of the `Answer` column in the Dataset.
* In **metadatas**, we can inform a list of topics. I used the value in the column `qtype`.
* In **id** we need to inform an unique identificator for each row. I'm creating the ID using the range of `MAX_ROWS`.



```python
collection.add(
    documents=subset_data[DOCUMENT].tolist(),
    metadatas=[{TOPIC: topic} for topic in subset_data[TOPIC].tolist()],
    ids=[f"id{x}" for x in range(MAX_ROWS)],
)
```

    /root/.cache/chroma/onnx_models/all-MiniLM-L6-v2/onnx.tar.gz: 100%|██████████| 79.3M/79.3M [00:01<00:00, 68.1MiB/s]
    

Once we have the information in the Database we can query it, and ask for data that matches our needs. The search is done inside the content of the document, and it dosn't look for the exact word, or phrase. The results will be based on the similarity between the search terms and the content of documents.

Metadata isn't directly involved in the initial search process, it can be used to filter or refine the results after retrieval, enabling further customization and precision.

Let's define a function to query the ChromaDB Database.


```python
def query_database(query_text, n_results=10):
    results = collection.query(query_texts=query_text, n_results=n_results )
    return results
```

## Creating the semantic cache system
To implement the cache system, we will use Faiss, a library that allows storing embeddings in memory. It's quite similar to what Chroma does, but without its persistence.

For this purpose, we will create a class called `semantic_cache` that will work with its own encoder and provide the necessary functions for the user to perform queries.

In this class, we first query the cache implemented with Faiss, that contains the previous petitions, and if the returned results are above a specified threshold, it will return the content of the cache. Otherwise, it will fetch the result from the Chroma database.

The cache is stored in a .json file.


```python
!pip install -q faiss-cpu==1.8.0
```


```python
import faiss
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
import time
import json
```

The `init_cache()` function below initializes the semantic cache.

It employs the FlatLS index, which might not be the fastest but is ideal for small datasets. Depending on the characteristics of the data intended for the cache and the expected dataset size, another index such as HNSW or IVF could be utilized.

I chose this index because it aligns well with the example. It can be used with vectors of high dimensions, consumes minimal memory, and performs well with small datasets.

I outline the key features of the various indices available with Faiss.

* FlatL2 or FlatIP. Well-suited for small datasets, it may not be the fastest, but its memory consumption is not excessive.
* LSH. It works effectively with small datasets and is recommended for use with vectors of up to 128 dimensions.
* HNSW. Very fast but demands a substantial amount of RAM.
* IVF. Works well with large datasets without consuming much memory or compromising performance.

More information about the different indices available with Faiss can be found at this link: https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss/wiki/Guidelines-to-choose-an-index


```python
def init_cache():
  index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(768)
  if index.is_trained:
    print('Index trained')

  # Initialize Sentence Transformer model
  encoder = SentenceTransformer('all-mpnet-base-v2')

  return index, encoder
```

In the `retrieve_cache` function, the .json file is retrieved from disk in case there is a need to reuse the cache across sessions.


```python
def retrieve_cache(json_file):
  try:
    with open(json_file, 'r') as file:
      cache = json.load(file)
  except FileNotFoundError:
      cache = {'questions': [], 'embeddings': [], 'answers': [], 'response_text': []}

  return cache
```

The `store_cache` function saves the file containing the cache data to disk.


```python
def store_cache(json_file, cache):
  with open(json_file, 'w') as file:
    json.dump(cache, file)
```

These functions will be used within the `SemanticCache` class, which includes the search function and its initialization function.

Even though the `ask` function has a substantial amount of code, its purpose is quite straightforward. It looks in the cache for the closest question to the one just made by the user.

Afterward, checks if it is within the specified threshold. If positive, it directly returns the response from the cache; otherwise, it calls the `query_database` function to retrieve the data from ChromaDB.

I've used Euclidean distance instead of Cosine, which is widely employed in vector comparisons. This choice is based on the fact that Euclidean distance is the default metric used by Faiss. Although Cosine distance can also be calculated, doing so adds complexity that may not significantly contribute to the final result.

I have included FIFO eviction policy in the semantic_cache class, which aims to improve its efficiency and flexibility. By introducing eviction policies, we provide users with the ability to control how the cache behaves when it reaches its maximum capacity. This is crucial for maintaining optimal cache performance and for handling situations where the available memory is constrained. 

Looking at the structure of the cache, the implementation of FIFO seemed straightforward. Whenever a new question-answer pair is added to the cache, it's appended to the end of the lists. Thus, the oldest (first-in) items are at the front of the lists. When the cache reaches its maximum size and you need to evict an item, you remove (pop) the first item from each list. This is the FIFO eviction policy. 


Another eviction policy is the Least Recently Used (LRU) policy, which is more complex because it requires knowledge of when each item in the cache was last accessed. However, this policy is not yet available and will be implemented later.



```python
class semantic_cache:
  def __init__(self, json_file="cache_file.json", thresold=0.35, max_response=100, eviction_policy=None):
    """Initializes the semantic cache.

    Args:
    json_file (str): The name of the JSON file where the cache is stored.
    thresold (float): The threshold for the Euclidean distance to determine if a question is similar.
    max_response (int): The maximum number of responses the cache can store.
    eviction_policy (str): The policy for evicting items from the cache. 
                            This can be any policy, but 'FIFO' (First In First Out) has been implemented for now.
                            If None, no eviction policy will be applied.

```python
results = cache.ask("How do vaccines work?")
```

    Answer recovered from ChromaDB. 
    response_text: Summary : Shots may hurt a little, but the diseases they can prevent are a lot worse. Some are even life-threatening. Immunization shots, or vaccinations, are essential. They protect against things like measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitis B, polio, tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (whooping cough). Immunizations are important for adults as well as children.    Your immune system helps your body fight germs by producing substances to combat them. Once it does, the immune system "remembers" the germ and can fight it again. Vaccines contain germs that have been killed or weakened. When given to a healthy person, the vaccine triggers the immune system to respond and thus build immunity.     Before vaccines, people became immune only by actually getting a disease and surviving it. Immunizations are an easier and less risky way to become immune.

As expected, this response has been obtained from ChromaDB. The class then stores it in the cache.

Now, if we send a second question that is quite different, the response should also be retrieved from ChromaDB. This is because the question stored previously is so dissimilar that it would surpass the specified threshold in terms of Euclidean distance.


```python

results = cache.ask("Explain briefly what is a Sydenham chorea")
```

    Answer recovered from ChromaDB. 
    response_text: Sydenham chorea (SD) is a neurological disorder of childhood resulting from infection via Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS), the bacterium that causes rheumatic fever. SD is characterized by rapid, irregular, and aimless involuntary movements of the arms and legs, trunk, and facial muscles. It affects girls more often than boys and typically occurs between 5 and 15 years of age. Some children will have a sore throat several weeks before the symptoms begin, but the disorder can also strike up to 6 months after the fever or infection has cleared. Symptoms can appear gradually or all at once, and also may include uncoordinated movements, muscular weakness, stumbling and falling, slurred speech, difficulty concentrating and writing, and emotional instability. The symptoms of SD can vary from a halting gait and slight grimacing to involuntary movements that are frequent and severe enough to be incapacitating. The random, writhing movements of chorea are caused by an auto-immune reaction to the bacterium that interferes with the normal function of a part of the brain (the basal ganglia) that controls motor movements. Due to better sanitary conditions and the use of antibiotics to treat streptococcal infections, rheumatic fever, and consequently SD, are rare in North America and Europe. The disease can still be found in developing nations.

Perfect, the semantic cache system is behaving as expected.

Let's proceed to test it with a question very similar to the one we just asked.

In this case, the response should come directly from the cache without the need to access the ChromaDB database.




```python
results = cache.ask("Briefly explain me what is a Sydenham chorea.")
```

    Answer recovered from Cache.

The two questions are so similar that their Euclidean distance is truly minimal, almost as if they were identical.

Now, let's try another question, this time a bit more distinct, and observe how the system behaves.


```python
question_def = "Write in 20 words what is a Sydenham chorea."
results = cache.ask(question_def)
```

    Answer recovered from Cache. 
    0.228 smaller than 0.35
    Found cache in row: 1 with score 0.228
    response_text: Sydenham chorea (SD) is a neurological disorder of childhood resulting from infection via Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS), the bacterium that causes rheumatic fever.

The disease can still be found in developing nations.
    Time taken: 0.016 seconds
    

We observe that the Euclidean distance has increased, but it still remains within the specified threshold. Therefore, it continues to return the response directly from the cache.

# Loading the model and creating the prompt
Time to use the library **transformers**, the most famous library from [hugging face](https://huggingface.co/) for working with language models.

We are importing:
* **Autotokenizer**: It is a utility class for tokenizing text inputs that are compatible with various pre-trained language models.
* **AutoModelForCausalLM**: it provides an interface to pre-trained language models specifically designed for language generation tasks using causal language modeling (e.g., GPT models), or the model used in this notebook [Gemma-2b-it](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-2b-it).

Please, feel free to test [different Models](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=text-generation&sort=trending), you need to search for NLP models trained for text-generation.



```python
!pip install torch
```


```python
from torch import cuda, torch
#In a MAC Silicon the device must be 'mps'
# device = torch.device('mps') #to use with MAC Silicon
device = f'cuda:{cuda.current_device()}' if cuda.is_available() else 'cpu'
```


```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

model_id = "google/gemma-2b-it"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id,
                                             device_map="cuda",
                                            torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16)
```



## Creating the extended prompt
To create the prompt we use the result from query the 'semantic_cache' class  and the question introduced by the user.

The prompt have two parts, the **relevant context** that is the information recovered from the database and the **user's question**.

We only need to put the two parts together to create the prompt then send it to the model.


```python
prompt_template = f"Relevant context: {results}\n\n The user's question: {question_def}"
prompt_template
```




    "Relevant context: Sydenham chorea (SD) is a neurological disorder of childhood resulting from infection via Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS), the bacterium that causes rheumatic fever.

```python
input_ids = tokenizer(prompt_template, return_tensors="pt").to("cuda")
```

Now all that remains is to send the prompt to the model and wait for its response!



```python
outputs = model.generate(**input_ids,
                         max_new_tokens=256)
print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))
```

     The user's question: Write in 20 words what is a Sydenham chorea.
    
    Sure, here is a 20-word answer:
    
    Sydenham chorea is a neurological disorder of childhood resulting from infection via Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS).<eos>
    

# Conclusion.
There's a 50% reduction in data retrieval time between accessing ChromaDB and going directly to the cache. However, in larger projects, this difference increases, leading to enhancements of 90-95%.

We have very few data in Chroma, and only a single instance of the cache class. Typically, the data behind the cache system is much larger, possibly involving more than just a query to a vector database but sourced from various places.

It's common to have multiple instances of the cache class, usually based on user typology, as questions tend to repeat more among users who share common traits.

In summary, we have created a very simple RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system and enhanced it with a semantic cache layer between the user's question and obtaining the information necessary to create the enriched prompt.

# Semantic Chunking for Document Processing

## Overview

This code implements a semantic chunking approach for processing and retrieving information from PDF documents, [first proposed by Greg Kamradt](https://youtu.be/8OJC21T2SL4?t=1933) and subsequently [implemented in LangChain](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/node_parsers/semantic_chunking/). Unlike traditional methods that split text based on fixed character or word counts, semantic chunking aims to create more meaningful and context-aware text segments.

## Motivation

Traditional text splitting methods often break documents at arbitrary points, potentially disrupting the flow of information and context. Semantic chunking addresses this issue by attempting to split text at more natural breakpoints, preserving semantic coherence within each chunk.

## Key Components

1. PDF processing and text extraction
2. Semantic chunking using LangChain's SemanticChunker
3. Vector store creation using FAISS and OpenAI embeddings
4. Retriever setup for querying the processed documents

## Method Details

### Document Preprocessing

1. The PDF is read and converted to a string using a custom `read_pdf_to_string` function.

### Semantic Chunking

1. Utilizes LangChain's `SemanticChunker` with OpenAI embeddings.
2. Three breakpoint types are available:
   - 'percentile': Splits at differences greater than the X percentile.
   - 'standard_deviation': Splits at differences greater than X standard deviations.
   - 'interquartile': Uses the interquartile distance to determine split points.
3. In this implementation, the 'percentile' method is used with a threshold of 90.

### Vector Store Creation

1. OpenAI embeddings are used to create vector representations of the semantic chunks.
2. A FAISS vector store is created from these embeddings for efficient similarity search.

### Retriever Setup

1. A retriever is configured to fetch the top 2 most relevant chunks for a given query.

## Key Features

1. Context-Aware Splitting: Attempts to maintain semantic coherence within chunks.
2. Flexible Configuration: Allows for different breakpoint types and thresholds.
3. Integration with Advanced NLP Tools: Uses OpenAI embeddings for both chunking and retrieval.

## Benefits of this Approach

1. Improved Coherence: Chunks are more likely to contain complete thoughts or ideas.
2. Better Retrieval Relevance: By preserving context, retrieval accuracy may be enhanced.
3. Adaptability: The chunking method can be adjusted based on the nature of the documents and retrieval needs.
4. Potential for Better Understanding: LLMs or downstream tasks may perform better with more coherent text segments.

## Implementation Details

1. Uses OpenAI's embeddings for both the semantic chunking process and the final vector representations.
2. Employs FAISS for creating an efficient searchable index of the chunks.
3. The retriever is set up to return the top 2 most relevant chunks, which can be adjusted as needed.

## Example Usage

The code includes a test query: "What is the main cause of climate change?". This demonstrates how the semantic chunking and retrieval system can be used to find relevant information from the processed document.

## Conclusion

Semantic chunking represents an advanced approach to document processing for retrieval systems. By attempting to maintain semantic coherence within text segments, it has the potential to improve the quality of retrieved information and enhance the performance of downstream NLP tasks. This technique is particularly valuable for processing long, complex documents where maintaining context is crucial, such as scientific papers, legal documents, or comprehensive reports.

path = "../data/Understanding_Climate_Change.pdf"
```

### Read PDF to string


```python
content = read_pdf_to_string(path)
```

### Breakpoint types: 
* 'percentile': all differences between sentences are calculated, and then any difference greater than the X percentile is split.
* 'standard_deviation': any difference greater than X standard deviations is split.
* 'interquartile': the interquartile distance is used to split chunks.


```python
text_splitter = SemanticChunker(OpenAIEmbeddings(), breakpoint_threshold_type='percentile', breakpoint_threshold_amount=90) # chose which embeddings and breakpoint type and threshold to use
```

```

### Create vector store and retriever


```python
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
vectorstore = FAISS.from_documents(docs, embeddings)
chunks_query_retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever(search_kwargs={"k": 2})
```

### Test the retriever


```python
test_query = "What is the main cause of climate change?"
context = retrieve_context_per_question(test_query, chunks_query_retriever)
show_context(context)

# Semantic reranking with Elasticsearch and Hugging Face

_Authored by: [Liam Thompson](https://github.com/leemthompo)_

In this notebook we will learn how to implement semantic reranking in Elasticsearch by uploading a model from Hugging Face into an Elasticsearch cluster. We'll use the `retriever` abstraction, a simpler Elasticsearch syntax for crafting queries and combining different search operations.

You will:

- Choose a cross-encoder model from Hugging Face to perform semantic reranking
- Upload the model to your Elasticsearch deployment using [Eland](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/eland/current/machine-learning.html)— a Python client for machine learning with Elasticsearch 
- Create an inference endpoint to manage your `rerank` task
- Query your data using the `text_similarity_rerank` retriever

## 🧰 Requirements

For this example, you will need:

- An Elastic deployment on version 8.15.0 or above (for non-serverless deployments)
    
    - We'll be using Elastic Cloud for this example (available with a [free trial](https://cloud.elastic.co/registration)).
    - See our other [deployment options](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/elasticsearch-intro.html#elasticsearch-intro-deploy)
-  You'll need to find your deployment's Cloud ID and create an API key. [Learn more](https://www.elastic.co/search-labs/tutorials/install-elasticsearch/elastic-cloud#finding-your-cloud-id).


## Install and import packages

ℹ️ The `eland` installation will take a couple of minutes.


```python
!pip install -qU elasticsearch
!pip install eland[pytorch]
from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch, helpers
```

## Initialize Elasticsearch Python client

First you need to connect to your Elasticsearch instance.


```python
from getpass import getpass

# https://www.elastic.co/search-labs/tutorials/install-elasticsearch/elastic-cloud#finding-your-cloud-id
ELASTIC_CLOUD_ID = getpass("Elastic Cloud ID: ")

# https://www.elastic.co/search-labs/tutorials/install-elasticsearch/elastic-cloud#creating-an-api-key
ELASTIC_API_KEY = getpass("Elastic Api Key: ")

# Create the client instance
client = Elasticsearch(
    # For local development
    # hosts=["http://localhost:9200"]
    cloud_id=ELASTIC_CLOUD_ID,
    api_key=ELASTIC_API_KEY,
)
```

    Elastic Cloud ID: ··········
    Elastic Api Key: ··········
    

## Test connection

Confirm that the Python client has connected to your Elasticsearch instance with this test.




```python
print(client.info())
```

This examples uses a small dataset of movies.


```python
from urllib.request import urlopen
import json
import time

url = "https://huggingface.co/datasets/leemthompo/small-movies/raw/main/small-movies.json"
response = urlopen(url)

# Load the response data into a JSON object
data_json = json.loads(response.read())

# Prepare the documents to be indexed
documents = []
for doc in data_json:
    documents.append(
        {
            "_index": "movies",
            "_source": doc,
        }
    )

# Use helpers.bulk to index
helpers.bulk(client, documents)

print("Done indexing documents into `movies` index!")
time.sleep(3)
```

    Done indexing documents into `movies` index!
    

## Upload Hugging Face model using Eland

Now we'll use Eland's `eland_import_hub_model` command to upload the model to Elasticsearch. For this example we've chosen the `cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2` text similarity model.


```python
!eland_import_hub_model \
  --cloud-id $ELASTIC_CLOUD_ID \
  --es-api-key $ELASTIC_API_KEY \
  --hub-model-id cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2 \
  --task-type text_similarity \
  --clear-previous \
  --start
```

## Create inference endpoint

Next we'll create an inference endpoint for the `rerank` task to deploy and manage our model and, if necessary, spin up the necessary ML resources behind the scenes.


```python
client.inference.put(
    task_type="rerank",
    inference_id="my-msmarco-minilm-model",
    inference_config={
        "service": "elasticsearch",
        "service_settings": {
            "model_id": "cross-encoder__ms-marco-minilm-l-6-v2",
            "num_allocations": 1,
            "num_threads": 1,
        },
    },
)
```




    ObjectApiResponse({'endpoints': [{'model_id': 'my-msmarco-minilm-model', 'inference_id': 'my-msmarco-minilm-model', 'task_type': 'rerank', 'service': 'elasticsearch', 'service_settings': {'num_allocations': 1, 'num_threads': 1, 'model_id': 'cross-encoder__ms-marco-minilm-l-6-v2'}, 'task_settings': {'return_documents': True}}]})



Run the following command to confirm your inference endpoint is deployed.


```python
client.inference.get()
```


⚠️ When you deploy your model, you might need to sync your ML saved objects in the Kibana (or Serverless) UI.
Go to **Trained Models** and select **Synchronize saved objects**.

## Lexical queries

First let's use a `standard` retriever to test out some lexical (or full-text) searches and then we'll compare the improvements when we layer in semantic reranking.

### Lexical match with `query_string` query

Let's say we vaguely remember that there is a famous movie about a killer who eats his victims. For the sake of argument, pretend we've momentarily forgotten the word "cannibal".

Let's perform a [`query_string` query](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-query-string-query.html) to find the phrase "flesh-eating bad guy" in the `plot` fields of our Elasticsearch documents.


```python
resp = client.search(
    index="movies",
    retriever={
        "standard": {
            "query": {
                "query_string": {
                    "query": "flesh-eating bad guy",
                    "default_field": "plot",
                }
            }
        }
    },
)

if resp["hits"]["hits"]:
    for hit in resp["hits"]["hits"]:
        title = hit["_source"]["title"]
        plot = hit["_source"]["plot"]
        print(f"Title: {title}\nPlot: {plot}\n")
else:
    print("No search results found")
```

    No search results found
    

No results! Unfortunately we don't have any near exact matches for "flesh-eating bad guy". Because we don't have any more specific information about the exact phrasing in the Elasticsearch data, we'll need to cast our search net wider.

### Simple `multi_match` query

This lexical query performs a standard keyword search for the term "crime" within the "plot" and "genre" fields of our Elasticsearch documents.


```python
resp = client.search(
    index="movies",
    retriever={
        "standard": {
            "query": {"multi_match": {"query": "crime", "fields": ["plot", "genre"]}}
        }
    },
)

for hit in resp["hits"]["hits"]:
    title = hit["_source"]["title"]
    plot = hit["_source"]["plot"]
    print(f"Title: {title}\nPlot: {plot}\n")
```

    Title: The Godfather
    Plot: An organized crime dynasty's aging patriarch transfers control of his clandestine empire to his reluctant son.
    
    Title: Goodfellas
    Plot: The story of Henry Hill and his life in the mob, covering his relationship with his wife Karen Hill and his mob partners Jimmy Conway and Tommy DeVito in the Italian-American crime syndicate.
    
    Title: The Silence of the Lambs
    Plot: A young F.B.I. cadet must receive the help of an incarcerated and manipulative cannibal killer to help catch another serial killer, a madman who skins his victims.
    
    Title: Pulp Fiction
    Plot: The lives of two mob hitmen, a boxer, a gangster and his wife, and a pair of diner bandits intertwine in four tales of violence and redemption.
    
    Title: Se7en
    Plot: Two detectives, a rookie and a veteran, hunt a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his motives.
    
    Title: The Departed
    Plot: An undercover cop and a mole in the police attempt to identify each other while infiltrating an Irish gang in South Boston.
    
    Title: The Usual Suspects
    Plot: A sole survivor tells of the twisty events leading up to a horrific gun battle on a boat, which began when five criminals met at a seemingly random police lineup.
    
    Title: The Dark Knight
    Plot: When the menace known as the Joker wreaks havoc and chaos on the people of Gotham, Batman must accept one of the greatest psychological and physical tests of his ability to fight injustice.
    
    

That's better! At least we've got some results now. We broadened our search criteria to increase the chances of finding relevant results.

But these results aren't very precise in the context of our original query "flesh-eating bad guy". We can see that "The Silence of the Lambs" is returned in the middle of the results set with this generic `match` query. Let's see if we can use our semantic reranking model to get closer to the searcher's original intent.

## Semantic reranker

In the following `retriever` syntax, we wrap our standard query retriever in a `text_similarity_reranker`. This allows us to leverage the NLP model we deployed to Elasticsearch to rerank the results based on the phrase "flesh-eating bad guy".


```python
resp = client.search(
    index="movies",
    retriever={
        "text_similarity_reranker": {
            "retriever": {
                "standard": {
                    "query": {
                        "multi_match": {"query": "crime", "fields": ["plot", "genre"]}
                    }
                }
            },
            "field": "plot",
            "inference_id": "my-msmarco-minilm-model",
            "inference_text": "flesh-eating bad guy",
        }
    },
)

for hit in resp["hits"]["hits"]:
    title = hit["_source"]["title"]
    plot = hit["_source"]["plot"]
    print(f"Title: {title}\nPlot: {plot}\n")
```

    Title: The Silence of the Lambs
    Plot: A young F.B.I. cadet must receive the help of an incarcerated and manipulative cannibal killer to help catch another serial killer, a madman who skins his victims.
    
    Title: Pulp Fiction
    Plot: The lives of two mob hitmen, a boxer, a gangster and his wife, and a pair of diner bandits intertwine in four tales of violence and redemption.
    
    Title: Se7en
    Plot: Two detectives, a rookie and a veteran, hunt a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his motives.
    
    Title: Goodfellas
    Plot: The story of Henry Hill and his life in the mob, covering his relationship with his wife Karen Hill and his mob partners Jimmy Conway and Tommy DeVito in the Italian-American crime syndicate.
    
    Title: The Dark Knight
    Plot: When the menace known as the Joker wreaks havoc and chaos on the people of Gotham, Batman must accept one of the greatest psychological and physical tests of his ability to fight injustice.
    
    Title: The Godfather
    Plot: An organized crime dynasty's aging patriarch transfers control of his clandestine empire to his reluctant son.
    
    Title: The Departed
    Plot: An undercover cop and a mole in the police attempt to identify each other while infiltrating an Irish gang in South Boston.
    
    Title: The Usual Suspects
    Plot: A sole survivor tells of the twisty events leading up to a horrific gun battle on a boat, which began when five criminals met at a seemingly random police lineup.
    
    

Success! "The Silence of the Lambs" is our top result. Semantic reranking helped us find the most relevant result by parsing a natural language query, overcoming the limitations of lexical search which relies more on exact matching.

Semantic reranking enables semantic search in a few steps, without the need for generating and storing embeddings. Being able to use open source models hosted on Hugging Face natively in your Elasticsearch cluster is great for prototyping, testing, and building search experiences.

# Semantic Search with Pinecone and OpenAI

In this guide you will learn how to use the OpenAI Embedding API to generate language embeddings, and then index those embeddings in the Pinecone vector database for fast and scalable vector search.

This is a powerful and common combination for building semantic search, question-answering, threat-detection, and other applications that rely on NLP and search over a large corpus of text data.

The basic workflow looks like this:

**Embed and index**

* Use the OpenAI Embedding API to generate vector embeddings of your documents (or any text data).
* Upload those vector embeddings into Pinecone, which can store and index millions/billions of these vector embeddings, and search through them at ultra-low latencies.

**Search**

* Pass your query text or document through the OpenAI Embedding API again.
* Take the resulting vector embedding and send it as a query to Pinecone.
* Get back semantically similar documents, even if they don't share any keywords with the query.

![Architecture overview](https://files.readme.io/6a3ea5a-pinecone-openai-overview.png)

Let's get started...

## Setup

We first need to setup our environment and retrieve API keys for OpenAI and Pinecone. Let's start with our environment, we need HuggingFace *Datasets* for our data, and the OpenAI and Pinecone clients:


```python
!pip install -qU \
    pinecone-client==3.0.2 \
    openai==1.10.0 \
    datasets==2.16.1
```

### Creating Embeddings

Then we initialize our connection to OpenAI Embeddings *and* Pinecone vector DB. Sign up for an API key over at [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com) and [Pinecone](https://app.pinecone.io).


```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="OPENAI_API_KEY"
)  # get API key from platform.openai.com
```

We can now create embeddings with the OpenAI Ada similarity model like so:


```python
MODEL = "text-embedding-3-small"

res = client.embeddings.create(
    input=[
        "Sample document text goes here",
        "there will be several phrases in each batch"
    ], model=MODEL
)

```python
print(f"vector 0: {len(res.data[0].embedding)}\nvector 1: {len(res.data[1].embedding)}")
```

    vector 0: 1536
    vector 1: 1536
    


```python
# we can extract embeddings to a list
embeds = [record.embedding for record in res.data]
len(embeds)
```

Next, we initialize our index to store vector embeddings with Pinecone.


```python
len(embeds[0])
```




    1536



Initialize connection to Pinecone, you can get a free API key in the [Pinecone dashboard](https://app.pinecone.io).


```python
from pinecone import Pinecone

pc = Pinecone(api_key="...")
```




```python
import time
from pinecone import ServerlessSpec

spec = ServerlessSpec(cloud="aws", region="us-west-2")

index_name = 'semantic-search-openai'

# check if index already exists (if shouldn't if this is your first run)
if index_name not in pc.list_indexes().names():
    # if does not exist, create index
    pc.create_index(
        index_name,
        dimension=len(embeds[0]),  # dimensionality of text-embed-3-small
        metric='dotproduct',
        spec=spec
    )
    # wait for index to be initialized
    while not pc.describe_index(index_name).status['ready']:
        time.sleep(1)

# connect to index
index = pc.Index(index_name)
time.sleep(1)
# view index stats
index.describe_index_stats()

     'namespaces': {},
     'total_vector_count': 0}



## Populating the Index

Now we will take 1K questions from the TREC dataset


```python
from datasets import load_dataset

# load the first 1K rows of the TREC dataset
trec = load_dataset('trec', split='train[:1000]')
trec
```

Then we create a vector embedding for each phrase using OpenAI, and `upsert` the ID, vector embedding, and original text for each phrase to Pinecone.

    # get batch of lines and IDs
    lines_batch = trec['text'][i: i+batch_size]
    ids_batch = [str(n) for n in range(i, i_end)]
    # create embeddings
    res = client.embeddings.create(input=lines_batch, model=MODEL)
    embeds = [record.embedding for record in res.data]

    meta = [{'text': line} for line in lines_batch]
    to_upsert = zip(ids_batch, embeds, meta)

# Querying

With our data indexed, we're now ready to move onto performing searches. This follows a similar process to indexing. We start with a text `query`, that we would like to use to find similar sentences. As before we encode this with OpenAI's text similarity Babbage model to create a *query vector* `xq`. We then use `xq` to query the Pinecone index.


```python
query = "What caused the 1929 Great Depression?"

xq = client.embeddings.create(input=query, model=MODEL).data[0].embedding
```

Now query...


```python
res = index.query(vector=[xq], top_k=5, include_metadata=True)
res
```

The response from Pinecone includes our original text in the `metadata` field, let's print out the `top_k` most similar questions and their respective similarity scores.


```python
for match in res['matches']:
    print(f"{match['score']:.2f}: {match['metadata']['text']}")
```

    0.75: Why did the world enter a global depression in 1929 ?
    0.60: When was `` the Great Depression '' ?
    0.37: What crop failure caused the Irish Famine ?
    0.32: What were popular songs and types of songs in the 1920s ?
    0.32: When did World War I start ?
    

Looks good, let's make it harder and replace *"depression"* with the incorrect term *"recession"*.


```python
query = "What was the cause of the major recession in the early 20th century?"

# create the query embedding
xq = client.embeddings.create(input=query, model=MODEL).data[0].embedding

# query, returning the top 5 most similar results
res = index.query(vector=[xq], top_k=5, include_metadata=True)

for match in res['matches']:
    print(f"{match['score']:.2f}: {match['metadata']['text']}")
```

    0.63: Why did the world enter a global depression in 1929 ?
    0.55: When was `` the Great Depression '' ?
    0.34: What were popular songs and types of songs in the 1920s ?
    0.33: What crop failure caused the Irish Famine ?
    0.29: What is considered the costliest disaster the insurance industry has ever faced ?
    

And again...


```python
query = "Why was there a long-term economic downturn in the early 20th century?"

# create the query embedding
xq = client.embeddings.create(input=query, model=MODEL).data[0].embedding

# query, returning the top 5 most similar results
res = index.query(vector=[xq], top_k=5, include_metadata=True)

for match in res['matches']:
    print(f"{match['score']:.2f}: {match['metadata']['text']}")
```

    0.62: Why did the world enter a global depression in 1929 ?
    0.54: When was `` the Great Depression '' ?
    0.34: What were popular songs and types of songs in the 1920s ?
    0.33: What crop failure caused the Irish Famine ?
    0.32: What do economists do ?
    

Looks great, our semantic search pipeline is clearly able to identify the meaning between each of our queries and return the most semantically similar questions from the already indexed questions.

Once we're finished with the index we delete it to save resources.


```python
pc.delete_index(index_name)
```

# Step 1: Setup the environment

There are 2 pre-requisites for this:

1.   **MongoDB Atlas cluster**: To create a forever free MongoDB Atlas cluster, first, you need to create a MongoDB Atlas account if you don't already have one. Visit the [MongoDB Atlas website](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) and click on “Register.” Visit the [MongoDB Atlas](https://account.mongodb.com/account/login) dashboard and set up your cluster. In order to take advantage of the `$vectorSearch` operator in an aggregation pipeline, you need to run MongoDB Atlas 6.0.11 or higher. This tutorial can be built using a free cluster. When you’re setting up your deployment, you’ll be prompted to set up a database user and rules for your network connection. Please ensure you save your username and password somewhere safe and have the correct IP address rules in place so your cluster can connect properly. If you need more help getting started, check out our [tutorial on MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/basics/mongodb-atlas-tutorial).

2. **OpenAI API key**   To create your OpenAI key, you'll need to create an account. Once you have that, visit the [OpenAI platform](https://platform.openai.com/). Click on your profile icon in the top right of the screen to get the dropdown menu and select “View API keys”.



```python
import getpass

MONGODB_ATLAS_CLUSTER_URI = getpass.getpass("MongoDB Atlas Cluster URI:")
OPENAI_API_KEY = getpass.getpass("OpenAI API Key:")

```

    MongoDB Atlas Cluster URI:··········
    OpenAI API Key:··········
    

Note: After executing the step above you will be prompted to enter the credentials.

For this tutorial, we will be using the
[MongoDB sample dataset](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/sample-data/). Load the sample dataset using the Atlas UI. We'll be using the “sample_mflix” database, which contains a “movies” collection where each document contains fields like title, plot, genres, cast, directors, etc.



```python
import openai
import pymongo

client = pymongo.MongoClient(MONGODB_ATLAS_CLUSTER_URI)
db = client.sample_mflix
collection = db.movies

openai.api_key = OPENAI_API_KEY
```


```python
ATLAS_VECTOR_SEARCH_INDEX_NAME = "default"
EMBEDDING_FIELD_NAME = "embedding_openai_nov19_23"
```

# Step 2: Setup embeddings generation function


```python
model = "text-embedding-3-small"
def generate_embedding(text: str) -> list[float]:
    return openai.embeddings.create(input = [text], model=model).data[0].embedding

```

# Step 3: Create and store embeddings

Each document in the sample dataset sample_mflix.movies corresponds to a movie; we will execute an operation to create a vector embedding for the data in the "plot" field and store it in the database. Creating vector embeddings using OpenAI embeddings endpoint is necessary for performing a similarity search based on intent.


```python
from pymongo import ReplaceOne

# Update the collection with the embeddings
requests = []

for doc in collection.find({'plot':{"$exists": True}}).limit(500):
  doc[EMBEDDING_FIELD_NAME] = generate_embedding(doc['plot'])
  requests.append(ReplaceOne({'_id': doc['_id']}, doc))

collection.bulk_write(requests)
```




    BulkWriteResult({'writeErrors': [], 'writeConcernErrors': [], 'nInserted': 0, 'nUpserted': 0, 'nMatched': 50, 'nModified': 50, 'nRemoved': 0, 'upserted': []}, acknowledged=True)



After executing the above, the documents in "movies" collection will contain an additional field of "embedding", as defined by the `EMBEDDDING_FIELD_NAME` variable, apart from already existing fields like title, plot, genres, cast, directors, etc.

Note: We are restricting this to just 500 documents in the interest of time. If you want to do this over the entire dataset of 23,000+ documents in our sample_mflix database, it will take a little while. Alternatively, you can use the [sample_mflix.embedded_movies collection](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/sample-data/sample-mflix/#sample_mflix.embedded_movies) which includes a pre-populated `plot_embedding` field that contains embeddings created using OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-small` embedding model that you can use with the Atlas Search vector search feature.




# Step 4: Create a vector search index

We will create Atlas Vector Search Index on this collection which will allow us to perform the Approximate KNN search, which powers the semantic search.
We will cover 2 ways to create this index - Atlas UI and using MongoDB python driver.

(Optional) [Documentation: Create a Vector Search Index ](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-search/field-types/knn-vector/)

Now head over to [Atlas UI](cloud.mongodb.com) and create an Atlas Vector Search index using the steps descibed [here](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-vector-search/vector-search-tutorial/#create-the-atlas-vector-search-index).  The 'dimensions' field with value 1536, corresponds to openAI text-embedding-ada002.

Use the definition given below in the JSON editor on the Atlas UI.

```
{
  "mappings": {
    "dynamic": true,
    "fields": {
      "embedding": {
        "dimensions": 1536,
        "similarity": "dotProduct",
        "type": "knnVector"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

(Optional) Alternatively, we can use [pymongo driver to create these vector search indexes programatically](https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/pymongo/collection.html#pymongo.collection.Collection.create_search_index)
The python command given in the cell below will create the index (this only works for the most recent version of the Python Driver for MongoDB and MongoDB server version 7.0+ Atlas cluster).


```python
collection.create_search_index(
    {"definition":
        {"mappings": {"dynamic": True, "fields": {
            EMBEDDING_FIELD_NAME : {
                "dimensions": 1536,
                "similarity": "dotProduct",
                "type": "knnVector"
                }}}},
     "name": ATLAS_VECTOR_SEARCH_INDEX_NAME
    }
)
```




    'default'



# Step 5: Query your data

The results for the query here finds movies which have semantically similar plots to the text captured in the query string, rather than being based on the keyword search.

(Optional) [Documentation: Run Vector Search Queries](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-vector-search/vector-search-stage/)


```python

def query_results(query, k):
  results = collection.aggregate([
    {
        '$vectorSearch': {
            "index": ATLAS_VECTOR_SEARCH_INDEX_NAME,
            "path": EMBEDDING_FIELD_NAME,
            "queryVector": generate_embedding(query),
            "numCandidates": 50,
            "limit": 5,
        }
    }
    ])
  return results
```


```python
query="imaginary characters from outerspace at war with earthlings"
movies = query_results(query, 5)

for movie in movies:
    print(f'Movie Name: {movie["title"]},\nMovie Plot: {movie["plot"]}\n')
```

# Fine-Tuning a Semantic Segmentation Model on a Custom Dataset and Usage via the Inference API


_Authored by: [Sergio Paniego](https://github.com/sergiopaniego)_

In this notebook, we will walk through the process of fine-tuning a [semantic segmentation](https://huggingface.co/tasks/image-segmentation) model on a custom dataset. The model we'll be using is the pretrained [Segformer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/segformer), a powerful and flexible transformer-based architecture for segmentation tasks.

![Segformer architecture](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/segformer_architecture.png)


For our dataset, we'll use [segments/sidewalk-semantic](https://huggingface.co/datasets/segments/sidewalk-semantic), which contains labeled images of sidewalks, making it ideal for applications in urban environments.

Example use-case: This model could be deployed in a delivery robot that autonomously navigates sidewalks to deliver pizza right to your door 🍕

Once we've fine-tuned the model, we'll demonstrate how to deploy it using the [Serverless Inference API](https://huggingface.co/docs/api-inference/index), making it accessible via a simple API endpoint.

## 1. Install Dependencies

To begin, we’ll install the essential libraries required for fine-tuning our semantic segmentation model.





```python
!pip install -q datasets transformers evaluate wandb
# Tested with datasets==3.0.0, transformers==4.44.2, evaluate==0.4.3, wandb==0.18.1
```

## 2. Loading the Dataset 📁

We'll be using the [sidewalk-semantic](https://huggingface.co/datasets/segments/sidewalk-semantic) dataset, which consists of images of sidewalks collected in Belgium during the summer of 2021.

The dataset includes:

* **1,000 images along with their corresponding semantic segmentation masks** 🖼
* **34 distinct categories** 📦

Since this dataset is gated, you'll need to log in and accept the license to gain access. We also require authentication to upload the fine-tuned model to the Hub after training.



```python
from huggingface_hub import notebook_login

notebook_login()
```


```python
sidewalk_dataset_identifier = "segments/sidewalk-semantic"
```


```python
from datasets import load_dataset

dataset = load_dataset(sidewalk_dataset_identifier)
```

Review the internal structure to get familiar with it!




```python
dataset
```




    DatasetDict({
        train: Dataset({
            features: ['pixel_values', 'label'],
            num_rows: 1000
        })
    })



Since the dataset only includes a training split, we will manually divide it into `training and test sets`. We'll allocate 80% of the data for training and reserve the remaining 20% for evaluation and testing. ➗



```python
dataset = dataset.shuffle(seed=42)
dataset = dataset["train"].train_test_split(test_size=0.2)
train_ds = dataset["train"]
test_ds = dataset["test"]
```

Let's examine the types of objects present in an example. We can see that `pixels_values` holds the RGB image, while `label` contains the ground truth mask. The mask is a single-channel image where each pixel represents the category of the corresponding pixel in the RGB image.



```python
image = train_ds[0]
image
```




    {'pixel_values': <PIL.JpegImagePlugin.JpegImageFile image mode=RGB size=1920x1080>,
     'label': <PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=L size=1920x1080>}



## 3. Visualizing Examples! 👀

Now that we’ve loaded the dataset, let’s visualize a few examples along with their masks to understand its structure better.

The dataset includes a JSON [file](https://huggingface.co/datasets/segments/sidewalk-semantic/blob/main/id2label.json) containing the `id2label` mapping. We’ll open this file to read the category labels associated with each ID.







```python
import json
from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download

filename = "id2label.json"
id2label = json.load(open(hf_hub_download(repo_id=sidewalk_dataset_identifier, filename=filename, repo_type="dataset"), "r"))
id2label = {int(k): v for k, v in id2label.items()}
label2id = {v: k for k, v in id2label.items()}

num_labels = len(id2label)
print("Id2label:", id2label)
```


    id2label.json:   0%|          | 0.00/852 [00:00<?, ?B/s]


    Id2label: {0: 'unlabeled', 1: 'flat-road', 2: 'flat-sidewalk', 3: 'flat-crosswalk', 4: 'flat-cyclinglane', 5: 'flat-parkingdriveway', 6: 'flat-railtrack', 7: 'flat-curb', 8: 'human-person', 9: 'human-rider', 10: 'vehicle-car', 11: 'vehicle-truck', 12: 'vehicle-bus', 13: 'vehicle-tramtrain', 14: 'vehicle-motorcycle', 15: 'vehicle-bicycle', 16: 'vehicle-caravan', 17: 'vehicle-cartrailer', 18: 'construction-building', 19: 'construction-door', 20: 'construction-wall', 21: 'construction-fenceguardrail', 22: 'construction-bridge', 23: 'construction-tunnel', 24: 'construction-stairs', 25: 'object-pole', 26: 'object-trafficsign', 27: 'object-trafficlight', 28: 'nature-vegetation', 29: 'nature-terrain', 30: 'sky', 31: 'void-ground', 32: 'void-dynamic', 33: 'void-static', 34: 'void-unclear'}
    

Let's assign colors to each category 🎨. This will help us visualize the segmentation results more effectively and make it easier to interpret the different categories in our images.



```python
sidewalk_palette = [
  [0, 0, 0], # unlabeled
  [216, 82, 24], # flat-road
  [255, 255, 0], # flat-sidewalk
  [125, 46, 141], # flat-crosswalk
  [118, 171, 47], # flat-cyclinglane
  [161, 19, 46], # flat-parkingdriveway
  [255, 0, 0], # flat-railtrack
  [0, 128, 128], # flat-curb

  [84, 84, 0], # vehicle-bus
  [84, 170, 0], # vehicle-tramtrain
  [84, 255, 0], # vehicle-motorcycle
  [170, 84, 0], # vehicle-bicycle
  [170, 170, 0], # vehicle-caravan
  [170, 255, 0], # vehicle-cartrailer
  [255, 84, 0], # construction-building
  [255, 170, 0], # construction-door
  [255, 255, 0], # construction-wall
  [33, 138, 200], # construction-fenceguardrail
  [0, 170, 127], # construction-bridge
  [0, 255, 127], # construction-tunnel
  [84, 0, 127], # construction-stairs
  [84, 84, 127], # object-pole
  [84, 170, 127], # object-trafficsign
  [84, 255, 127], # object-trafficlight
  [170, 0, 127], # nature-vegetation
  [170, 84, 127], # nature-terrain
  [170, 170, 127], # sky
  [170, 255, 127], # void-ground
  [255, 0, 127], # void-dynamic
  [255, 84, 127], # void-static
  [255, 170, 127], # void-unclear
]
```

We can visualize some examples from the dataset, including the RGB image, the corresponding mask, and an overlay of the mask on the image. This will help us better understand the dataset and how the masks correspond to the images. 📸



```python
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image
import matplotlib.patches as patches

# Create and show the legend separately
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(18, 2))

legend_patches = [patches.Patch(color=np.array(color)/255, label=label) for label, color in zip(id2label.values(), sidewalk_palette)]

## 4. Visualize Class Occurrences 📊

To gain deeper insights into the dataset, let’s plot the occurrences of each class. This will allow us to understand the distribution of classes and identify any potential biases or imbalances in the dataset.



```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

class_counts = np.zeros(len(id2label))

for example in train_ds:
    mask_np = np.array(example['label'])
    unique, counts = np.unique(mask_np, return_counts=True)
    for u, c in zip(unique, counts):
        class_counts[u] += c
```


```python
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import patches

labels = list(id2label.values())

# Normalize colors to be in the range [0, 1]
normalized_palette = [tuple(c / 255 for c in color) for color in sidewalk_palette]

# Visualization
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12, 8))

bars = ax.bar(range(len(labels)), class_counts, color=[normalized_palette[i] for i in range(len(labels))])

ax.set_xticks(range(len(labels)))
ax.set_xticklabels(labels, rotation=90, ha="right")

ax.set_xlabel("Categories", fontsize=14)
ax.set_ylabel("Number of Occurrences", fontsize=14)
ax.set_title("Number of Occurrences by Category", fontsize=16)

ax.grid(axis="y", linestyle="--", alpha=0.7)

# Adjust the y-axis limit
y_max = max(class_counts)
ax.set_ylim(0, y_max * 1.25)

for bar in bars:
    height = int(bar.get_height())
    offset = 10  # Adjust the text location
    ax.text(bar.get_x() + bar.get_width() / 2.0, height + offset, f"{height}",
            ha="center", va="bottom", rotation=90, fontsize=10, color='black')

fig.legend(handles=legend_patches, loc='center left', bbox_to_anchor=(1, 0.5), ncol=1, fontsize=8)  # Adjust ncol as needed

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

```

## 5. Initialize Image Processor and Add Data Augmentation with Albumentations 📸

We will start by initializing the image processor and then apply data augmentation 🪄 using [Albumentations](https://albumentations.ai/). This will help enhance our dataset and improve the performance of our semantic segmentation model.



```python
import albumentations as A
from transformers import SegformerImageProcessor

image_processor = SegformerImageProcessor()

albumentations_transform = A.Compose([
    A.HorizontalFlip(p=0.5),
    A.ShiftScaleRotate(shift_limit=0.1, scale_limit=0.1, rotate_limit=30, p=0.7),
    A.RandomResizedCrop(height=512, width=512, scale=(0.8, 1.0), ratio=(0.75, 1.33), p=0.5),
    A.RandomBrightnessContrast(brightness_limit=0.25, contrast_limit=0.25, p=0.5),
    A.HueSaturationValue(hue_shift_limit=10, sat_shift_limit=25, val_shift_limit=20, p=0.5),
    A.GaussianBlur(blur_limit=(3, 5), p=0.3),
    A.GaussNoise(var_limit=(10, 50), p=0.4),
])

def train_transforms(example_batch):
    augmented_images = [albumentations_transform(image=np.array(x))['image'] for x in example_batch['pixel_values']]
    labels = [x for x in example_batch['label']]
    inputs = image_processor(augmented_images, labels)
    return inputs

def val_transforms(example_batch):
    images = [x for x in example_batch['pixel_values']]
    labels = [x for x in example_batch['label']]
    inputs = image_processor(images, labels)
    return inputs


# Set transforms
train_ds.set_transform(train_transforms)
test_ds.set_transform(val_transforms)
```

    The cache for model files in Transformers v4.22.0 has been updated. Migrating your old cache. This is a one-time only operation. You can interrupt this and resume the migration later on by calling `transformers.utils.move_cache()`.
    


    0it [00:00, ?it/s]


## 6. Initialize Model from Checkpoint

We will use a pretrained Segformer model from the checkpoint: [nvidia/mit-b0](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/mit-b0). This architecture is detailed in the paper [SegFormer: Simple and Efficient Design for Semantic Segmentation with Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.15203) and has been trained on ImageNet-1k.



```python
from transformers import SegformerForSemanticSegmentation

pretrained_model_name = "nvidia/mit-b0"
model = SegformerForSemanticSegmentation.from_pretrained(
    pretrained_model_name,
    id2label=id2label,
    label2id=label2id
)
```

## 7. Set Training Arguments and Connect to Weights & Biases 📉

Next, we'll configure the training arguments and connect to [Weights & Biases (W&B)](https://wandb.ai/). W&B will assist us in tracking experiments, visualizing metrics, and managing the model training workflow, providing valuable insights throughout the process.



```python
from transformers import TrainingArguments

output_dir = "segformer-b0-segments-sidewalk-finetuned"

training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir=output_dir,
    learning_rate=6e-5,
    num_train_epochs=20,
    per_device_train_batch_size=8,
    per_device_eval_batch_size=8,
    save_total_limit=2,
    evaluation_strategy="steps",
    save_strategy="steps",
    save_steps=20,
    eval_steps=20,
    logging_steps=1,
    eval_accumulation_steps=5,
    load_best_model_at_end=True,
    push_to_hub=True,
    report_to="wandb"
)
```


```python
import wandb

wandb.init(
    project="segformer-b0-segments-sidewalk-finetuned",  # change this
    name="segformer-b0-segments-sidewalk-finetuned",  # change this
    config=training_args,
)
```

## 8. Set Custom `compute_metrics` Method for Enhanced Logging with `evaluate`

We will use the [mean Intersection over Union (mean IoU)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/evaluate-metric/mean_iou) as the primary metric to evaluate the model’s performance. This will allow us to track performance across each category in detail.

Additionally, we’ll adjust the logging level of the evaluation module to minimize warnings in the output. If a category is not detected in an image, you might see warnings like the following:

```
RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in divide iou = total_area_intersect / total_area_union
```


You can skip this cell if you prefer to see these warnings and proceed to the next step.



```python
import evaluate
evaluate.logging.set_verbosity_error()
```


```python
import torch
from torch import nn
import multiprocessing

metric = evaluate.load("mean_iou")

def compute_metrics(eval_pred):
  with torch.no_grad():
    logits, labels = eval_pred
    logits_tensor = torch.from_numpy(logits)
    # scale the logits to the size of the label
    logits_tensor = nn.functional.interpolate(
        logits_tensor,
        size=labels.shape[-2:],
        mode="bilinear",
        align_corners=False,
    ).argmax(dim=1)

    # currently using _compute instead of compute: https://github.com/huggingface/evaluate/pull/328#issuecomment-1286866576
    pred_labels = logits_tensor.detach().cpu().numpy()
    import warnings
    with warnings.catch_warnings():
        warnings.simplefilter("ignore", RuntimeWarning)
        metrics = metric._compute(
                predictions=pred_labels,
                references=labels,
                num_labels=len(id2label),
                ignore_index=0,
                reduce_labels=image_processor.do_reduce_labels,
            )

    # add per category metrics as individual key-value pairs
    per_category_accuracy = metrics.pop("per_category_accuracy").tolist()
    per_category_iou = metrics.pop("per_category_iou").tolist()

    metrics.update({f"accuracy_{id2label[i]}": v for i, v in enumerate(per_category_accuracy)})
    metrics.update({f"iou_{id2label[i]}": v for i, v in enumerate(per_category_iou)})

    return metrics
```

## 9. Train the Model on Our Dataset 🏋

Now it's time to train the model on our custom dataset. We’ll use the prepared training arguments and the connected Weights & Biases integration to monitor the training process and make adjustments as needed. Let’s start the training and watch the model improve its performance!



```python
from transformers import Trainer

trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=train_ds,
    eval_dataset=test_ds,
    tokenizer=image_processor,
    compute_metrics=compute_metrics,
)
```


```python
trainer.train()
```

## 10. Evaluate Model Performance on New Images 📸

After training, we’ll assess the model’s performance on new images. We’ll use a test image and leverage a [pipeline](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/pipelines) to evaluate how well the model performs on unseen data.



```python
import requests
from transformers import pipeline
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image, ImageDraw

url = "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1594098742644-314fedf61fb6?q=80&w=2672&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D"

image = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)

image_segmentator = pipeline(
    "image-segmentation", model="sergiopaniego/segformer-b0-segments-sidewalk-finetuned" # Change with your model name
)

results = image_segmentator(image)
```


```python
plt.imshow(image)
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
```


    
![png](output_38_0.png)
    


The model has generated some masks, so we can visualize them to evaluate and understand its performance. This will help us see how well the model is segmenting the images and identify any areas for improvement.



```python
image_array = np.array(image)

segmentation_map = np.zeros_like(image_array)

for result in results:
    mask = np.array(result['mask'])
    label = result['label']

    label_index = list(id2label.values()).index(label)

    color = sidewalk_palette[label_index]

    for c in range(3):
        segmentation_map[:, :, c] = np.where(mask, color[c], segmentation_map[:, :, c])

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 10))
plt.imshow(image_array)
plt.imshow(segmentation_map, alpha=0.5)
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
```


    
![png](output_40_0.png)
    


## 11. Evaluate Performance on the Test Set 📊



```python
metrics = trainer.evaluate(test_ds)
print(metrics)
```

## 12. Access the Model Using the Inference API and Visualize Results 🔌


Hugging Face 🤗 provides a [Serverless Inference API](https://huggingface.co/docs/api-inference/index) that allows you to test models directly via API endpoints for free. For detailed guidance on using this API, check out this [cookbook](https://huggingface.co/learn/cookbook/enterprise_hub_serverless_inference_api).

We will use this API to explore its functionality and see how it can be leveraged for testing our model.

Once the model task is set up, we can download an image and use the [InferenceClient](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/v0.25.0/en/package_reference/inference_client) to test the model. This client will allow us to send the image to the model through the API and retrieve the results for evaluation.



```python
url = "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1594098742644-314fedf61fb6?q=80&w=2672&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D"

plt.imshow(image)

We will use the [image_segmentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/v0.25.0/en/package_reference/inference_client#huggingface_hub.InferenceClient.image_segmentation) method from the InferenceClient. This method takes the model and an image as inputs and returns the predicted masks. This will allow us to test how well the model performs on new images.



```python
from huggingface_hub import InferenceClient

client = InferenceClient()

response = client.image_segmentation(
    model="sergiopaniego/segformer-b0-segments-sidewalk-finetuned", # Change with your model name

)

print(response)
```

With the predicted masks, we can display the results.


```python
image_array = np.array(image)
segmentation_map = np.zeros_like(image_array)

for result in response:
    mask = np.array(result['mask'])
    label = result['label']

    label_index = list(id2label.values()).index(label)

    color = sidewalk_palette[label_index]

    for c in range(3):
        segmentation_map[:, :, c] = np.where(mask, color[c], segmentation_map[:, :, c])

It’s also possible to use the [Inference API with JavaScript](https://huggingface.co/tasks/image-segmentation). Here’s an example of how you can consume the API using JavaScript:

```
import { HfInference } from "@huggingface/inference";

const inference = new HfInference(HF_TOKEN);
await inference.imageSegmentation({
    data: await (await fetch("https://picsum.photos/300/300")).blob(),
    model: "sergiopaniego/segformer-b0-segments-sidewalk-finetuned",
});

```



**Extra Points**

You can also deploy the fine-tuned model using a Hugging Face Space. For example, I have created a custom Space to showcase this: [Semantic Segmentation with SegFormer Fine-Tuned on Segments/Sidewalk](https://huggingface.co/spaces/sergiopaniego/segformer-b0-segments-sidewalk-finetuned).

<img src="https://huggingface.co/front/thumbnails/spaces.png" alt="HF Spaces logo" width="20%">



```python
from IPython.display import IFrame
IFrame(src='https://sergiopaniego-segformer-b0-segments-sidewalk-finetuned.hf.space', width=1000, height=800)
```





<iframe
    width="1000"
    height="800"
    src="https://sergiopaniego-segformer-b0-segments-sidewalk-finetuned.hf.space"
    frameborder="0"
    allowfullscreen

></iframe>




## Conclusion

In this guide, we successfully fine-tuned a semantic segmentation model on a custom dataset and utilized the Serverless Inference API to test it. This demonstrates how easily you can integrate the model into various applications and leverage Hugging Face tools for deployment.

I hope this guide provides you with the tools and knowledge to confidently fine-tune and deploy your own models! 🚀

# Semantic text search using embeddings

We can search through all our reviews semantically in a very efficient manner and at very low cost, by embedding our search query, and then finding the most similar reviews. The dataset is created in the [Get_embeddings_from_dataset Notebook](Get_embeddings_from_dataset.ipynb).

## Installation
Install the Azure Open AI SDK using the below command.


```csharp
#r "nuget: Azure.AI.OpenAI, 1.0.0-beta.14"
```


<div><div></div><div></div><div><strong>Installed Packages</strong><ul><li><span>Azure.AI.OpenAI, 1.0.0-beta.12</span></li></ul></div></div>



```csharp
#r "nuget:Microsoft.DotNet.Interactive.AIUtilities, 1.0.0-beta.24129.1"

using Microsoft.DotNet.Interactive;
using Microsoft.DotNet.Interactive.AIUtilities;
```

## Run this cell, it will prompt you for the apiKey, endPoint, and embedding deployment


```csharp
var azureOpenAIKey = await Kernel.GetPasswordAsync("Provide your OPEN_AI_KEY");

// Your endpoint should look like the following https://YOUR_OPEN_AI_RESOURCE_NAME.openai.azure.com/
var azureOpenAIEndpoint = await Kernel.GetInputAsync("Provide the OPEN_AI_ENDPOINT");

// Enter the deployment name you chose when you deployed the model.
var deployment = await Kernel.GetInputAsync("Provide embedding deployment name");
```

Let's define the function `SearchReviews` that is used to search a dataset of reviews using embeddings. The function takes an array of data rows, a query string, and an optional result count (defaulting to 5), and returns an array of the top matching reviews.

The code starts by making an asynchronous request to an AI service (likely OpenAI) to generate an embedding for the query. The `GetEmbeddingsAsync` method of the `client` object is used to make this request. The method takes an instance of `EmbeddingsOptions` as a parameter, which specifies the deployment of the embedding model and the text to be embedded (in this case, the query). The response from the AI service is then processed to extract the query's embedding.

Next, it calculates the similarity between the query's embedding and the embeddings of all data rows using the `ScoreBySimilarityTo` method. This calculates a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors, between the query's embedding and each row's embedding. The `CosineSimilarityComparer<float[]>(t => t)` is used to specify how to calculate the similarity.

The resulting scores are then ordered in descending order and the top `resultCount` scores are selected. This means that the method is returning the top `resultCount` rows that have the highest similarity scores with the query's embedding.

Finally, the it extracts the text of each selected row using the `Select(r => r.Key.Text)` expression and converts the resulting collection to an array. This array of review texts is returned as the search results.


```csharp
async Task<string[]> SearchReviews(DataRow[] data, string query, int resultCount = 5)
{
    var queryEmbeddingResponse = await client.GetEmbeddingsAsync(new EmbeddingsOptions(deployment, new []{ query }));
    var queryEmbedding = queryEmbeddingResponse.Value.Data[0].Embedding.ToArray();
    var result = data
        .ScoreBySimilarityTo(queryEmbedding, new CosineSimilarityComparer<float[]>(t => t),e => e.Embedding.ToArray())
        .OrderByDescending(s => s.Score)
        .Take(resultCount)
        .Select(r => r.Value.Text);

        return result.ToArray();
}
```


```csharp
var results = await SearchReviews(data, "whole wheat pasta",3);
foreach(var result in results)
{
    result.Display();
}
```


    Barilla Whole Grain Fusilli with Vegetable Marinara is tasty and has an excellent chunky vegetable marinara.  I just wish there was more of it.  If you aren't starving or on a diet, the 9oz serving is enough for lunch although you might want to add a piece of fruit to feel full.  The whole grain fusilli cooked to al dente tenderness following the instructions and the chunky marinara sauce is so good that I wished there was more of it.  Rarely do I eat sauce alone but this sauce is good enough to.



    tastes so good. Worth the money. My boyfriend hates wheat pasta and LOVES this. cooks fast tastes great.I love this brand and started buying more of their pastas. Bulk is best.



    Anything this company makes is worthwhile eating! My favorite is their Trenne.<br />Their whole wheat pasta is the best I have ever had.



```csharp
var results = await SearchReviews(data, "bad delivery",1);
foreach(var result in results)
{
    result.Display();
}
```


    The bag came broken. Product was leaking out of the box, due to poor packing standards.<br />Hope next items arrive unscathed. Quinoa tasted good.



```csharp
var results = await SearchReviews(data, "spoilt",1);
foreach(var result in results)
{
    result.Display();
}
```


    The bag came broken. Product was leaking out of the box, due to poor packing standards.<br />Hope next items arrive unscathed. Quinoa tasted good.

    The only dry food my queen cat will eat. Helps prevent hair balls. Good packaging. Arrives promptly. Recommended by a friend who sells pet food.





################################################## Semi_structured_and_multi_modal_RAG.md ##################################################


## Semi-structured and Multi-modal RAG

Many documents contain a mixture of content types, including text, tables, and images. 

Semi-structured data can be challenging for conventional RAG for at least two reasons: 

* Text splitting may break up tables, corrupting the data in retrieval
* Embedding tables may pose challenges for semantic similarity search

And the information captured in images is typically lost.

With the emergence of multimodal LLMs, like [GPT4-V](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4v-system-card), it is worth considering how to utilize images in RAG:

`Option 1:` 

* Use multimodal embeddings (such as [CLIP](https://openai.com/research/clip)) to embed images and text
* Retrieve both using similarity search
* Pass raw images and text chunks to a multimodal LLM for answer synthesis 

`Option 2:` 

* Use a multimodal LLM (such as [GPT4-V](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4v-system-card), [LLaVA](https://llava.hliu.cc/), or [FUYU-8b](https://www.adept.ai/blog/fuyu-8b)) to produce text summaries from images
* Embed and retrieve text 
* Pass text chunks to an LLM for answer synthesis 

`Option 3:` 

* Use a multimodal LLM (such as [GPT4-V](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4v-system-card), [LLaVA](https://llava.hliu.cc/), or [FUYU-8b](https://www.adept.ai/blog/fuyu-8b)) to produce text summaries from images
* Embed and retrieve image summaries with a reference to the raw image 
* Pass raw images and text chunks to a multimodal LLM for answer synthesis   

This cookbook show how we might tackle this :

* We will use [Unstructured](https://unstructured.io/) to parse images, text, and tables from documents (PDFs).
* We will use the [multi-vector retriever](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/multi_vector) to store raw tables, text, (optionally) images along with their summaries for retrieval.
* We will demonstrate `Option 2`, and will follow-up on the other approaches in future cookbooks.

## Packages


```python
! pip install langchain langchain-chroma "unstructured[all-docs]" pydantic lxml
```

## Data Loading

### Partition PDF tables, text, and images
  
* `LLaVA` Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.08485.pdf
* Use [Unstructured](https://unstructured-io.github.io/unstructured/) to partition elements


```python
path = "/Users/rlm/Desktop/Papers/LLaVA/"
```


```python
from typing import Any

from pydantic import BaseModel
from unstructured.partition.pdf import partition_pdf

# Get elements
raw_pdf_elements = partition_pdf(
    filename=path + "LLaVA.pdf",
    # Using pdf format to find embedded image blocks
    extract_images_in_pdf=True,
    # Use layout model (YOLOX) to get bounding boxes (for tables) and find titles
    # Titles are any sub-section of the document
    infer_table_structure=True,
    # Post processing to aggregate text once we have the title
    chunking_strategy="by_title",
    # Chunking params to aggregate text blocks
    # Attempt to create a new chunk 3800 chars
    # Attempt to keep chunks > 2000 chars
    # Hard max on chunks
    max_characters=4000,
    new_after_n_chars=3800,
    combine_text_under_n_chars=2000,
    image_output_dir_path=path,
)
```


```python
# Create a dictionary to store counts of each type
category_counts = {}

for element in raw_pdf_elements:
    category = str(type(element))
    if category in category_counts:
        category_counts[category] += 1
    else:
        category_counts[category] = 1

# Unique_categories will have unique elements
unique_categories = set(category_counts.keys())
category_counts
```




    {"<class 'unstructured.documents.elements.CompositeElement'>": 31,
     "<class 'unstructured.documents.elements.Table'>": 3}




```python
class Element(BaseModel):
    type: str
    text: Any


# Categorize by type
categorized_elements = []
for element in raw_pdf_elements:
    if "unstructured.documents.elements.Table" in str(type(element)):
        categorized_elements.append(Element(type="table", text=str(element)))
    elif "unstructured.documents.elements.CompositeElement" in str(type(element)):
        categorized_elements.append(Element(type="text", text=str(element)))

# Tables
table_elements = [e for e in categorized_elements if e.type == "table"]
print(len(table_elements))

# Text
text_elements = [e for e in categorized_elements if e.type == "text"]
print(len(text_elements))
```

    3
    31
    

## Multi-vector retriever

Use [multi-vector-retriever](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/multi_vector#summary).

Summaries are used to retrieve raw tables and / or raw chunks of text.

### Text and Table summaries


```python
from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
```


```python
# Prompt
prompt_text = """You are an assistant tasked with summarizing tables and text. \
Give a concise summary of the table or text. Table or text chunk: {element} """
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(prompt_text)

# Summary chain
model = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model="gpt-4")
summarize_chain = {"element": lambda x: x} | prompt | model | StrOutputParser()
```


```python
# Apply to text
texts = [i.text for i in text_elements]
text_summaries = summarize_chain.batch(texts, {"max_concurrency": 5})
```


```python
# Apply to tables
tables = [i.text for i in table_elements]
table_summaries = summarize_chain.batch(tables, {"max_concurrency": 5})
```

### Images

We will implement `Option 2` discussed above: 

* Use a multimodal LLM ([LLaVA](https://llava.hliu.cc/)) to produce text summaries from images
* Embed and retrieve text 
* Pass text chunks to an LLM for answer synthesis 

#### Image summaries 

We will use [LLaVA](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA/), an open source multimodal model.
 
We will use [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/3436) to run LLaVA locally (e.g., on a Mac laptop):

* Clone [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp)
* Download the LLaVA model: `mmproj-model-f16.gguf` and one of `ggml-model-[f16|q5_k|q4_k].gguf` from [LLaVA 7b repo](https://huggingface.co/mys/ggml_llava-v1.5-7b/tree/main)
* Build
```
mkdir build && cd build && cmake ..
cmake --build .
```
* Run inference across images:
```
/Users/rlm/Desktop/Code/llama.cpp/bin/llava -m ../models/llava-7b/ggml-model-q5_k.gguf --mmproj ../models/llava-7b/mmproj-model-f16.gguf --temp 0.1 -p "Describe the image in detail. Be specific about graphs, such as bar plots." --image "$img" > "$output_file"
```


```bash
%%bash

# Define the directory containing the images
IMG_DIR=~/Desktop/Papers/LLaVA/

# Loop through each image in the directory
for img in "${IMG_DIR}"*.jpg; do
    # Extract the base name of the image without extension
    base_name=$(basename "$img" .jpg)

    # Define the output file name based on the image name
    output_file="${IMG_DIR}${base_name}.txt"

    # Execute the command and save the output to the defined output file
    /Users/rlm/Desktop/Code/llama.cpp/bin/llava -m ../models/llava-7b/ggml-model-q5_k.gguf --mmproj ../models/llava-7b/mmproj-model-f16.gguf --temp 0.1 -p "Describe the image in detail. Be specific about graphs, such as bar plots." --image "$img" > "$output_file"

done

```

Note: 

To run LLaVA with python bindings, we need a Python API to run the CLIP model. 

CLIP support is likely to be added to `llama.cpp` in the future.

After running the above, we  fetch and clean image summaries.


```python
import glob
import os

# Get all .txt file summaries
file_paths = glob.glob(os.path.expanduser(os.path.join(path, "*.txt")))

# Read each file and store its content in a list
img_summaries = []
for file_path in file_paths:
    with open(file_path, "r") as file:
        img_summaries.append(file.read())

# Remove any logging prior to summary
logging_header = "clip_model_load: total allocated memory: 201.27 MB\n\n"
cleaned_img_summary = [s.split(logging_header, 1)[1].strip() for s in img_summaries]
```

### Add to vectorstore

Use [Multi Vector Retriever](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/multi_vector#summary) with summaries.


```python
import uuid

from langchain.retrievers.multi_vector import MultiVectorRetriever
from langchain.storage import InMemoryStore
from langchain_chroma import Chroma
from langchain_core.documents import Document
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings

# The vectorstore to use to index the child chunks
vectorstore = Chroma(collection_name="summaries", embedding_function=OpenAIEmbeddings())

# The storage layer for the parent documents
store = InMemoryStore()
id_key = "doc_id"

# The retriever (empty to start)
retriever = MultiVectorRetriever(
    vectorstore=vectorstore,
    docstore=store,
    id_key=id_key,
)

# Add texts
doc_ids = [str(uuid.uuid4()) for _ in texts]
summary_texts = [
    Document(page_content=s, metadata={id_key: doc_ids[i]})
    for i, s in enumerate(text_summaries)
]
retriever.vectorstore.add_documents(summary_texts)
retriever.docstore.mset(list(zip(doc_ids, texts)))

# Add tables
table_ids = [str(uuid.uuid4()) for _ in tables]
summary_tables = [
    Document(page_content=s, metadata={id_key: table_ids[i]})
    for i, s in enumerate(table_summaries)
]
retriever.vectorstore.add_documents(summary_tables)
retriever.docstore.mset(list(zip(table_ids, tables)))
```

For `option 2` (above): 

* Store the image summary in the `docstore`, which we return to the LLM for answer generation.


```python
# Add image summaries
img_ids = [str(uuid.uuid4()) for _ in cleaned_img_summary]
summary_img = [
    Document(page_content=s, metadata={id_key: img_ids[i]})
    for i, s in enumerate(cleaned_img_summary)
]
retriever.vectorstore.add_documents(summary_img)
retriever.docstore.mset(list(zip(img_ids, cleaned_img_summary)))
```

For `option 3` (above): 

* Store the images in the `docstore`.
* Using the image in answer synthesis will require a multimodal LLM with Python API integration.
* GPT4-V is expected soon, and - as mentioned above - CLIP support is likely to be added to `llama.cpp` in the future.


```python
# Add images
img_ids = [str(uuid.uuid4()) for _ in cleaned_img_summary]
summary_img = [
    Document(page_content=s, metadata={id_key: img_ids[i]})
    for i, s in enumerate(cleaned_img_summary)
]
retriever.vectorstore.add_documents(summary_img)
### Fetch images
retriever.docstore.mset(
    list(
        zip(
            img_ids,
        )
    )
)
```

### Sanity Check retrieval

The most complex table in the paper:


```python

## RAG

Run [RAG pipeline](https://python.langchain.com/docs/expression_language/cookbook/retrieval).

For `option 1` (above): 

* Simply pass retrieved text chunks to LLM, as usual.

For `option 2a` (above): 

* We would pass retrieved image and images to the multi-modal LLM.
* This should be possible soon, once [llama-cpp-python add multi-modal support](https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python/issues/813).
* And, of course, this will be enabled by GPT4-V API.

## Private Semi-structured and Multi-modal RAG w/ LLaMA2 and LLaVA

Many documents contain a mixture of content types, including text, tables, and images. 

Semi-structured data can be challenging for conventional RAG for at least two reasons: 

* Text splitting may break up tables, corrupting the data in retrieval
* Embedding tables may pose challenges for semantic similarity search

And the information captured in images is typically lost.

With the emergence of multimodal LLMs, like [GPT4-V](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4v-system-card), it is worth considering how to utilize images in RAG:

`Option 1:` 

* Use multimodal embeddings (such as [CLIP](https://openai.com/research/clip)) to embed images and text
* Retrieve both using similarity search
* Pass raw images and text chunks to a multimodal LLM for answer synthesis 

`Option 2:` 

* Use a multimodal LLM (such as [GPT4-V](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4v-system-card), [LLaVA](https://llava.hliu.cc/), or [FUYU-8b](https://www.adept.ai/blog/fuyu-8b)) to produce text summaries from images
* Embed and retrieve text 
* Pass text chunks to an LLM for answer synthesis 

`Option 3:` 

* Use a multimodal LLM (such as [GPT4-V](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4v-system-card), [LLaVA](https://llava.hliu.cc/), or [FUYU-8b](https://www.adept.ai/blog/fuyu-8b)) to produce text summaries from images
* Embed and retrieve image summaries with a reference to the raw image 
* Pass raw images and text chunks to a multimodal LLM for answer synthesis   

This cookbook show how we might tackle this :

* We will use [Unstructured](https://unstructured.io/) to parse images, text, and tables from documents (PDFs).
* We will use the [multi-vector retriever](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/multi_vector) to store raw tables, text, (optionally) images along with their summaries for retrieval.
* We will demonstrate `Option 2`, and will follow-up on the other approaches in future cookbooks.

## Packages


```python
! pip install langchain langchain-chroma "unstructured[all-docs]" pydantic lxml
```

## Data Loading

### Partition PDF tables, text, and images
  
* `LLaVA` Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.08485.pdf
* Use [Unstructured](https://unstructured-io.github.io/unstructured/) to partition elements


```python
from typing import Any

from pydantic import BaseModel
from unstructured.partition.pdf import partition_pdf

# Path to save images
path = "/Users/rlm/Desktop/Papers/LLaVA/"

# Get elements
raw_pdf_elements = partition_pdf(
    filename=path + "LLaVA.pdf",
    # Using pdf format to find embedded image blocks
    extract_images_in_pdf=True,
    # Use layout model (YOLOX) to get bounding boxes (for tables) and find titles
    # Titles are any sub-section of the document
    infer_table_structure=True,
    # Post processing to aggregate text once we have the title
    chunking_strategy="by_title",
    # Chunking params to aggregate text blocks
    # Attempt to create a new chunk 3800 chars
    # Attempt to keep chunks > 2000 chars
    # Hard max on chunks
    max_characters=4000,
    new_after_n_chars=3800,
    combine_text_under_n_chars=2000,
    image_output_dir_path=path,
)
```


```python
# Create a dictionary to store counts of each type
category_counts = {}

for element in raw_pdf_elements:
    category = str(type(element))
    if category in category_counts:
        category_counts[category] += 1
    else:
        category_counts[category] = 1

# Unique_categories will have unique elements
# TableChunk if Table > max chars set above
unique_categories = set(category_counts.keys())
category_counts
```




    {"<class 'unstructured.documents.elements.CompositeElement'>": 31,
     "<class 'unstructured.documents.elements.Table'>": 3}




```python
class Element(BaseModel):
    type: str
    text: Any


# Categorize by type
categorized_elements = []
for element in raw_pdf_elements:
    if "unstructured.documents.elements.Table" in str(type(element)):
        categorized_elements.append(Element(type="table", text=str(element)))
    elif "unstructured.documents.elements.CompositeElement" in str(type(element)):
        categorized_elements.append(Element(type="text", text=str(element)))

# Tables
table_elements = [e for e in categorized_elements if e.type == "table"]
print(len(table_elements))

# Text
text_elements = [e for e in categorized_elements if e.type == "text"]
print(len(text_elements))
```

    3
    31
    

## Multi-vector retriever

Use [multi-vector-retriever](/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/multi_vector#summary).

Summaries are used to retrieve raw tables and / or raw chunks of text.

### Text and Table summaries

Here, we use Ollama to run LLaMA2 locally. 

See details on installation [here](/docs/guides/development/local_llms).


```python
from langchain_community.chat_models import ChatOllama
from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
```


```python
# Prompt
prompt_text = """You are an assistant tasked with summarizing tables and text. \
Give a concise summary of the table or text. Table or text chunk: {element} """
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(prompt_text)

# Summary chain
model = ChatOllama(model="llama2:13b-chat")
summarize_chain = {"element": lambda x: x} | prompt | model | StrOutputParser()
```


```python
# Apply to text
texts = [i.text for i in text_elements if i.text != ""]
text_summaries = summarize_chain.batch(texts, {"max_concurrency": 5})
```


```python
# Apply to tables
tables = [i.text for i in table_elements]
table_summaries = summarize_chain.batch(tables, {"max_concurrency": 5})
```

### Images

We will implement `Option 2` discussed above: 

* Use a multimodal LLM ([LLaVA](https://llava.hliu.cc/)) to produce text summaries from images
* Embed and retrieve text 
* Pass text chunks to an LLM for answer synthesis 

#### Image summaries 

We will use [LLaVA](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA/), an open source multimodal model.
 
We will use [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/3436) to run LLaVA locally (e.g., on a Mac laptop):

* Clone [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp)
* Download the LLaVA model: `mmproj-model-f16.gguf` and one of `ggml-model-[f16|q5_k|q4_k].gguf` from [LLaVA 7b repo](https://huggingface.co/mys/ggml_llava-v1.5-7b/tree/main)
* Build
```
mkdir build && cd build && cmake ..
cmake --build .
```
* Run inference across images:
```
/Users/rlm/Desktop/Code/llama.cpp/bin/llava -m ../models/llava-7b/ggml-model-q5_k.gguf --mmproj ../models/llava-7b/mmproj-model-f16.gguf --temp 0.1 -p "Describe the image in detail. Be specific about graphs, such as bar plots." --image "$img" > "$output_file"
```


```bash
%%bash

# Define the directory containing the images
IMG_DIR=~/Desktop/Papers/LLaVA/

# Loop through each image in the directory
for img in "${IMG_DIR}"*.jpg; do
    # Extract the base name of the image without extension
    base_name=$(basename "$img" .jpg)

    # Define the output file name based on the image name
    output_file="${IMG_DIR}${base_name}.txt"

    # Execute the command and save the output to the defined output file
    /Users/rlm/Desktop/Code/llama.cpp/bin/llava -m ../models/llava-7b/ggml-model-q5_k.gguf --mmproj ../models/llava-7b/mmproj-model-f16.gguf --temp 0.1 -p "Describe the image in detail. Be specific about graphs, such as bar plots." --image "$img" > "$output_file"

done

```


```python
import glob
import os

# Get all .txt files in the directory
file_paths = glob.glob(os.path.expanduser(os.path.join(path, "*.txt")))

# Read each file and store its content in a list
img_summaries = []
for file_path in file_paths:
    with open(file_path, "r") as file:
        img_summaries.append(file.read())

# Clean up residual logging
cleaned_img_summary = [
    s.split("clip_model_load: total allocated memory: 201.27 MB\n\n", 1)[1].strip()
    for s in img_summaries
]
```

### Add to vectorstore

Use [Multi Vector Retriever](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/multi_vector#summary) with summaries.

We use GPT4All embeddings to run locally, which are a [CPU optimized version of BERT](https://docs.gpt4all.io/gpt4all_python_embedding.html).


```python
import uuid

from langchain.retrievers.multi_vector import MultiVectorRetriever
from langchain.storage import InMemoryStore
from langchain_chroma import Chroma
from langchain_community.embeddings import GPT4AllEmbeddings
from langchain_core.documents import Document

# The vectorstore to use to index the child chunks
vectorstore = Chroma(
    collection_name="summaries", embedding_function=GPT4AllEmbeddings()
)

# The storage layer for the parent documents
store = InMemoryStore()  # <- Can we extend this to images
id_key = "doc_id"

# The retriever (empty to start)
retriever = MultiVectorRetriever(
    vectorstore=vectorstore,
    docstore=store,
    id_key=id_key,
)
```

    Found model file at  /Users/rlm/.cache/gpt4all/ggml-all-MiniLM-L6-v2-f16.bin
    

    objc[42078]: Class GGMLMetalClass is implemented in both /Users/rlm/miniforge3/envs/llama2/lib/python3.9/site-packages/gpt4all/llmodel_DO_NOT_MODIFY/build/libreplit-mainline-metal.dylib (0x31f870208) and /Users/rlm/miniforge3/envs/llama2/lib/python3.9/site-packages/gpt4all/llmodel_DO_NOT_MODIFY/build/libllamamodel-mainline-metal.dylib (0x31fc9c208). One of the two will be used. Which one is undefined.
    

For `option 2` (above): 

* Store the image summary in the `docstore`, which we return to the LLM for answer generation.


```python
# Add texts
doc_ids = [str(uuid.uuid4()) for _ in texts]
summary_texts = [
    Document(page_content=s, metadata={id_key: doc_ids[i]})
    for i, s in enumerate(text_summaries)
]
retriever.vectorstore.add_documents(summary_texts)
retriever.docstore.mset(list(zip(doc_ids, texts)))

# Add tables
table_ids = [str(uuid.uuid4()) for _ in tables]
summary_tables = [
    Document(page_content=s, metadata={id_key: table_ids[i]})
    for i, s in enumerate(table_summaries)
]
retriever.vectorstore.add_documents(summary_tables)
retriever.docstore.mset(list(zip(table_ids, tables)))

# Add images
img_ids = [str(uuid.uuid4()) for _ in cleaned_img_summary]
summary_img = [
    Document(page_content=s, metadata={id_key: img_ids[i]})
    for i, s in enumerate(cleaned_img_summary)
]
retriever.vectorstore.add_documents(summary_img)
retriever.docstore.mset(
    list(zip(img_ids, cleaned_img_summary))
)  # Store the image summary as the raw document
```

### Sanity Check

Image:

![figure-8-1.jpg](227da97f-e1ae-4252-b577-03a873a321e9.jpg)

We can retrieve this image summary:


```python
retriever.invoke("Images / figures with playful and creative examples")[0]
```




    'The image features a close-up of a tray filled with various pieces of fried chicken. The chicken pieces are arranged in a way that resembles a map of the world, with some pieces placed in the shape of continents and others as countries. The arrangement of the chicken pieces creates a visually appealing and playful representation of the world, making it an interesting and creative presentation.\n\nmain: image encoded in   865.20 ms by CLIP (    1.50 ms per image patch)'



## RAG

Run [RAG pipeline](https://python.langchain.com/docs/expression_language/cookbook/retrieval).

For `option 1` (above): 

* Simply pass retrieved text chunks to LLM, as usual.

For `option 2a` (above): 

* We would pass retrieved image and images to the multi-modal LLM.
* This should be possible soon, once [llama-cpp-python add multi-modal support](https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python/issues/813).

## Semi-structured RAG

Many documents contain a mixture of content types, including text and tables. 

Semi-structured data can be challenging for conventional RAG for at least two reasons: 

* Text splitting may break up tables, corrupting the data in retrieval
* Embedding tables may pose challenges for semantic similarity search 

This cookbook shows how to perform RAG on documents with semi-structured data: 

* We will use [Unstructured](https://unstructured.io/) to parse both text and tables from documents (PDFs).
* We will use the [multi-vector retriever](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/multi_vector) to store raw tables, text along with table summaries better suited for retrieval.
* We will use [LCEL](https://python.langchain.com/docs/expression_language/) to implement the chains used.

The overall flow is here:

![MVR.png](7b5c5a30-393c-4b27-8fa1-688306ef2aef.png)

## Packages


```python
! pip install langchain langchain-chroma "unstructured[all-docs]" pydantic lxml langchainhub
```

The PDF partitioning used by Unstructured will use: 

* `tesseract` for Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
*  `poppler` for PDF rendering and processing


```python
! brew install tesseract
! brew install poppler
```

## Data Loading

### Partition PDF tables and text

Apply to the [`LLaMA2`](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.09288.pdf) paper. 

We use the Unstructured [`partition_pdf`](https://unstructured-io.github.io/unstructured/core/partition.html#partition-pdf), which segments a PDF document by using a layout model. 

This layout model makes it possible to extract elements, such as tables, from pdfs. 

We also can use `Unstructured` chunking, which:

* Tries to identify document sections (e.g., Introduction, etc)
* Then, builds text blocks that maintain sections while also honoring user-defined chunk sizes


```python
path = "/Users/rlm/Desktop/Papers/LLaMA2/"
```


```python
from typing import Any

from pydantic import BaseModel
from unstructured.partition.pdf import partition_pdf

# Get elements
raw_pdf_elements = partition_pdf(
    filename=path + "LLaMA2.pdf",
    # Unstructured first finds embedded image blocks
    extract_images_in_pdf=False,
    # Use layout model (YOLOX) to get bounding boxes (for tables) and find titles
    # Titles are any sub-section of the document
    infer_table_structure=True,
    # Post processing to aggregate text once we have the title
    chunking_strategy="by_title",
    # Chunking params to aggregate text blocks
    # Attempt to create a new chunk 3800 chars
    # Attempt to keep chunks > 2000 chars
    max_characters=4000,
    new_after_n_chars=3800,
    combine_text_under_n_chars=2000,
    image_output_dir_path=path,
)
```

We can examine the elements extracted by `partition_pdf`.

`CompositeElement` are aggregated chunks.


```python
# Create a dictionary to store counts of each type
category_counts = {}

for element in raw_pdf_elements:
    category = str(type(element))
    if category in category_counts:
        category_counts[category] += 1
    else:
        category_counts[category] = 1

# Unique_categories will have unique elements
unique_categories = set(category_counts.keys())
category_counts
```




    {"<class 'unstructured.documents.elements.CompositeElement'>": 184,
     "<class 'unstructured.documents.elements.Table'>": 47,
     "<class 'unstructured.documents.elements.TableChunk'>": 2}




```python
class Element(BaseModel):
    type: str
    text: Any


# Categorize by type
categorized_elements = []
for element in raw_pdf_elements:
    if "unstructured.documents.elements.Table" in str(type(element)):
        categorized_elements.append(Element(type="table", text=str(element)))
    elif "unstructured.documents.elements.CompositeElement" in str(type(element)):
        categorized_elements.append(Element(type="text", text=str(element)))

# Tables
table_elements = [e for e in categorized_elements if e.type == "table"]
print(len(table_elements))

# Text
text_elements = [e for e in categorized_elements if e.type == "text"]
print(len(text_elements))
```

    49
    184
    

## Multi-vector retriever

Use [multi-vector-retriever](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/multi_vector#summary) to produce summaries of tables and, optionally, text. 

With the summary, we will also store the raw table elements.

The summaries are used to improve the quality of retrieval, [as explained in the multi vector retriever docs](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/multi_vector).

The raw tables are passed to the LLM, providing the full table context for the LLM to generate the answer.  

### Summaries


```python
from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
```

We create a simple summarize chain for each element.

You can also see, re-use, or modify the prompt in the Hub [here](https://smith.langchain.com/hub/rlm/multi-vector-retriever-summarization).

```
from langchain import hub
obj = hub.pull("rlm/multi-vector-retriever-summarization")
```


```python
# Prompt
prompt_text = """You are an assistant tasked with summarizing tables and text. \ 
Give a concise summary of the table or text. Table or text chunk: {element} """
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(prompt_text)

# Summary chain
model = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model="gpt-4")
summarize_chain = {"element": lambda x: x} | prompt | model | StrOutputParser()
```


```python
# Apply to tables
tables = [i.text for i in table_elements]
table_summaries = summarize_chain.batch(tables, {"max_concurrency": 5})
```


```python
# Apply to texts
texts = [i.text for i in text_elements]
text_summaries = summarize_chain.batch(texts, {"max_concurrency": 5})
```

### Add to vectorstore

Use [Multi Vector Retriever](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/multi_vector#summary) with summaries: 

* `InMemoryStore` stores the raw text, tables
* `vectorstore` stores the embedded summaries


```python
import uuid

from langchain.retrievers.multi_vector import MultiVectorRetriever
from langchain.storage import InMemoryStore
from langchain_chroma import Chroma
from langchain_core.documents import Document
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings

# The vectorstore to use to index the child chunks
vectorstore = Chroma(collection_name="summaries", embedding_function=OpenAIEmbeddings())

# The storage layer for the parent documents
store = InMemoryStore()
id_key = "doc_id"

# The retriever (empty to start)
retriever = MultiVectorRetriever(
    vectorstore=vectorstore,
    docstore=store,
    id_key=id_key,
)

# Add texts
doc_ids = [str(uuid.uuid4()) for _ in texts]
summary_texts = [
    Document(page_content=s, metadata={id_key: doc_ids[i]})
    for i, s in enumerate(text_summaries)
]
retriever.vectorstore.add_documents(summary_texts)
retriever.docstore.mset(list(zip(doc_ids, texts)))

# Add tables
table_ids = [str(uuid.uuid4()) for _ in tables]
summary_tables = [
    Document(page_content=s, metadata={id_key: table_ids[i]})
    for i, s in enumerate(table_summaries)
]
retriever.vectorstore.add_documents(summary_tables)
retriever.docstore.mset(list(zip(table_ids, tables)))
```

## RAG

Run [RAG pipeline](https://python.langchain.com/docs/expression_language/cookbook/retrieval).


```python
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnablePassthrough

# Prompt template
template = """Answer the question based only on the following context, which can include text and tables:
{context}
Question: {question}
"""
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(template)

# LLM
model = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model="gpt-4")

# RAG pipeline
chain = (
    {"context": retriever, "question": RunnablePassthrough()}
    | prompt
    | model
    | StrOutputParser()
)
```


```python
chain.invoke("What is the number of training tokens for LLaMA2?")
```




    'The number of training tokens for LLaMA2 is 2.0T.'



We can check the [trace](https://smith.langchain.com/public/4739ae7c-1a13-406d-bc4e-3462670ebc01/r) to see what chunks were retrieved:

# Sentence Transformers on Hugging Face

>[Hugging Face sentence-transformers](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers) is a Python framework for state-of-the-art sentence, text and image embeddings.
>You can use these embedding models from the `HuggingFaceEmbeddings` class.

:::caution

Running sentence-transformers locally can be affected by your operating system and other global factors. It is recommended for experienced users only.

:::

## Setup

You'll need to install the `langchain_huggingface` package as a dependency:


```python
%pip install -qU langchain-huggingface
```

## Usage


```python
from langchain_huggingface import HuggingFaceEmbeddings

embeddings = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name="all-MiniLM-L6-v2")

text = "This is a test document."
query_result = embeddings.embed_query(text)

# show only the first 100 characters of the stringified vector
print(str(query_result)[:100] + "...")
```

    [-0.038338568061590195, 0.12346471101045609, -0.028642969205975533, 0.05365273356437683, 0.008845377...
    


```python
doc_result = embeddings.embed_documents([text, "This is not a test document."])
print(str(doc_result)[:100] + "...")
```

    [[-0.038338497281074524, 0.12346471846103668, -0.028642890974879265, 0.05365274101495743, 0.00884535...

from typing_extensions import TypedDict # in python 3.12 replace typing_extensions with typing
```

## Configure your API key

To run the following cell, your API key must be stored it in a Colab Secret named `GOOGLE_API_KEY`. If you don't already have an API key, or you're not sure how to create a Colab Secret, see [Authentication](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Authentication.ipynb) for an example.


```
from google.colab import userdata
GOOGLE_API_KEY=userdata.get('GOOGLE_API_KEY')

genai.configure(api_key=GOOGLE_API_KEY)
```

## Example

Start by defining how you want your JSON to be returned and which categories you would like to classify an item by. After that,gGo ahead and define some examples. In this case, you are trying to classify reviews as positive, neutral, or negative.


```
sentiment_llm = genai.GenerativeModel(model_name='gemini-1.5-flash-latest',
                                      generation_config={"response_mime_type": "application/json"})
prompt = """
Generate each sentiment score probability (positive, negative, or neutral) for the whole text.

Use the following schema to return the sentiment scores:

class Sentiment(TypedDict):
  positive_sentiment_score: float
  negative_sentiment_score: float
  neutral_sentiment_score: float

{review}"""
```


```
negative_review = "This establishment is an insult to the culinary arts, with inedible food that left me questioning the chef's sanity and the health inspector's judgment."
positive_review = "This restaurant is a true gem with impeccable service and a menu that tantalizes the taste buds. Every dish is a culinary masterpiece, crafted with fresh ingredients and bursting with flavor."
neutral_review = "The restaurant offers a decent dining experience with average food and service, making it a passable choice for a casual meal."
```

Here is a helper function to print formatted JSON:


```
def print_json(response):
  print(json.dumps(json.loads(response.text), indent=4))
```

Take a look at each of the probabilities returned to see how each of these reviews would be classified by the Gemini model.


```
response = sentiment_llm.generate_content(prompt.format(review=negative_review))
print_json(response)
```

    {
        "positive_sentiment_score": 0.0,
        "negative_sentiment_score": 0.9999999403953552,
        "neutral_sentiment_score": 5.96046448e-08
    }
    


```
response = sentiment_llm.generate_content(prompt.format(review=positive_review))
print_json(response)
```

    {
        "positive_sentiment_score": 0.987756,
        "negative_sentiment_score": 0.012244,
        "neutral_sentiment_score": 0.0
    }
    


```
response = sentiment_llm.generate_content(prompt.format(review=neutral_review))
print_json(response)
```

    {
        "positive_sentiment_score": 0.213,
        "negative_sentiment_score": 0.193,
        "neutral_sentiment_score": 0.594
    }
    

## Summary
You have now used Gemini to analyze the sentiment of restaurant reviews with JSON, but you can try it out on other types of texts, such as comments under a video or emails.

Please see the other notebooks in this directory to learn more about how you can use the Gemini API for other JSON related tasks.

# How to chain runnables

:::info Prerequisites

This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:
- [LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)](/docs/concepts/lcel)
- [Prompt templates](/docs/concepts/prompt_templates)
- [Chat models](/docs/concepts/chat_models)
- [Output parser](/docs/concepts/output_parsers)

:::

One point about [LangChain Expression Language](/docs/concepts/lcel) is that any two runnables can be "chained" together into sequences. The output of the previous runnable's `.invoke()` call is passed as input to the next runnable. This can be done using the pipe operator (`|`), or the more explicit `.pipe()` method, which does the same thing.

The resulting [`RunnableSequence`](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/core/runnables/langchain_core.runnables.base.RunnableSequence.html) is itself a runnable, which means it can be invoked, streamed, or further chained just like any other runnable. Advantages of chaining runnables in this way are efficient streaming (the sequence will stream output as soon as it is available), and debugging and tracing with tools like [LangSmith](/docs/how_to/debugging).

## The pipe operator: `|`

To show off how this works, let's go through an example. We'll walk through a common pattern in LangChain: using a [prompt template](/docs/how_to#prompt-templates) to format input into a [chat model](/docs/how_to#chat-models), and finally converting the chat message output into a string with an [output parser](/docs/how_to#output-parsers).

import ChatModelTabs from "@theme/ChatModelTabs";

<ChatModelTabs
  customVarName="model"
/>



```python
# | output: false
# | echo: false

import os
from getpass import getpass

from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic

if "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" not in os.environ:
    os.environ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"] = getpass()

model = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-sonnet-20240229", temperature=0)
```


```python
from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template("tell me a joke about {topic}")

chain = prompt | model | StrOutputParser()
```

Prompts and models are both runnable, and the output type from the prompt call is the same as the input type of the chat model, so we can chain them together. We can then invoke the resulting sequence like any other runnable:


```python
chain.invoke({"topic": "bears"})
```




    "Here's a bear joke for you:\n\nWhy did the bear dissolve in water?\nBecause it was a polar bear!"



### Coercion

We can even combine this chain with more runnables to create another chain. This may involve some input/output formatting using other types of runnables, depending on the required inputs and outputs of the chain components.

For example, let's say we wanted to compose the joke generating chain with another chain that evaluates whether or not the generated joke was funny.

We would need to be careful with how we format the input into the next chain. In the below example, the dict in the chain is automatically parsed and converted into a [`RunnableParallel`](/docs/how_to/parallel), which runs all of its values in parallel and returns a dict with the results.

This happens to be the same format the next prompt template expects. Here it is in action:


```python
from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser

analysis_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template("is this a funny joke? {joke}")

composed_chain = {"joke": chain} | analysis_prompt | model | StrOutputParser()

composed_chain.invoke({"topic": "bears"})
```




    'Haha, that\'s a clever play on words! Using "polar" to imply the bear dissolved or became polar/polarized when put in water. Not the most hilarious joke ever, but it has a cute, groan-worthy pun that makes it mildly amusing. I appreciate a good pun or wordplay joke.'



Functions will also be coerced into runnables, so you can add custom logic to your chains too. The below chain results in the same logical flow as before:


```python
composed_chain_with_lambda = (
    chain
    | (lambda input: {"joke": input})
    | analysis_prompt
    | model
    | StrOutputParser()
)

composed_chain_with_lambda.invoke({"topic": "beets"})
```




    "Haha, that's a cute and punny joke! I like how it plays on the idea of beets blushing or turning red like someone blushing. Food puns can be quite amusing. While not a total knee-slapper, it's a light-hearted, groan-worthy dad joke that would make me chuckle and shake my head. Simple vegetable humor!"



However, keep in mind that using functions like this may interfere with operations like streaming. See [this section](/docs/how_to/functions) for more information.

## The `.pipe()` method

We could also compose the same sequence using the `.pipe()` method. Here's what that looks like:


```python
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableParallel

composed_chain_with_pipe = (
    RunnableParallel({"joke": chain})
    .pipe(analysis_prompt)
    .pipe(model)
    .pipe(StrOutputParser())
)

composed_chain_with_pipe.invoke({"topic": "battlestar galactica"})
```




    "I cannot reproduce any copyrighted material verbatim, but I can try to analyze the humor in the joke you provided without quoting it directly.\n\nThe joke plays on the idea that the Cylon raiders, who are the antagonists in the Battlestar Galactica universe, failed to locate the human survivors after attacking their home planets (the Twelve Colonies) due to using an outdated and poorly performing operating system (Windows Vista) for their targeting systems.\n\nThe humor stems from the juxtaposition of a futuristic science fiction setting with a relatable real-world frustration – the use of buggy, slow, or unreliable software or technology. It pokes fun at the perceived inadequacies of Windows Vista, which was widely criticized for its performance issues and other problems when it was released.\n\nBy attributing the Cylons' failure to locate the humans to their use of Vista, the joke creates an amusing and unexpected connection between a fictional advanced race of robots and a familiar technological annoyance experienced by many people in the real world.\n\nOverall, the joke relies on incongruity and relatability to generate humor, but without reproducing any copyrighted material directly."



Or the abbreviated:


```python
composed_chain_with_pipe = RunnableParallel({"joke": chain}).pipe(
    analysis_prompt, model, StrOutputParser()
)
```

# How to save and load LangChain objects

LangChain classes implement standard methods for serialization. Serializing LangChain objects using these methods confer some advantages:

- Secrets, such as API keys, are separated from other parameters and can be loaded back to the object on de-serialization;
- De-serialization is kept compatible across package versions, so objects that were serialized with one version of LangChain can be properly de-serialized with another.

To save and load LangChain objects using this system, use the `dumpd`, `dumps`, `load`, and `loads` functions in the [load module](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/core/load.html) of `langchain-core`. These functions support JSON and JSON-serializable objects.

All LangChain objects that inherit from [Serializable](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/core/load/langchain_core.load.serializable.Serializable.html) are JSON-serializable. Examples include [messages](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference//python/core_api_reference.html#module-langchain_core.messages), [document objects](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/core/documents/langchain_core.documents.base.Document.html) (e.g., as returned from [retrievers](/docs/concepts/retrievers)), and most [Runnables](/docs/concepts/lcel), such as chat models, retrievers, and [chains](/docs/how_to/sequence) implemented with the LangChain Expression Language.

Below we walk through an example with a simple [LLM chain](/docs/tutorials/llm_chain).

:::caution

De-serialization using `load` and `loads` can instantiate any serializable LangChain object. Only use this feature with trusted inputs!

De-serialization is a beta feature and is subject to change.
:::


```python
from langchain_core.load import dumpd, dumps, load, loads
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [
        ("system", "Translate the following into {language}:"),
        ("user", "{text}"),
    ],
)

llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini", api_key="llm-api-key")

chain = prompt | llm
```

## Saving objects

### To json


```python
string_representation = dumps(chain, pretty=True)
print(string_representation[:500])
```

    {
      "lc": 1,
      "type": "constructor",
      "id": [
        "langchain",
        "schema",
        "runnable",
        "RunnableSequence"
      ],
      "kwargs": {
        "first": {
          "lc": 1,
          "type": "constructor",
          "id": [
            "langchain",
            "prompts",
            "chat",
            "ChatPromptTemplate"
          ],
          "kwargs": {
            "input_variables": [
              "language",
              "text"
            ],
            "messages": [
              {
                "lc": 1,
                "type": "constructor",
             
    

### To a json-serializable Python dict


```python
dict_representation = dumpd(chain)

print(type(dict_representation))
```

    <class 'dict'>
    

### To disk


```python
import json

with open("/tmp/chain.json", "w") as fp:
    json.dump(string_representation, fp)
```

Note that the API key is withheld from the serialized representations. Parameters that are considered secret are specified by the `.lc_secrets` attribute of the LangChain object:


```python
chain.last.lc_secrets
```




    {'openai_api_key': 'OPENAI_API_KEY'}



## Loading objects

Specifying `secrets_map` in `load` and `loads` will load the corresponding secrets onto the de-serialized LangChain object.

### From string


```python
chain = loads(string_representation, secrets_map={"OPENAI_API_KEY": "llm-api-key"})
```

### From dict


```python
chain = load(dict_representation, secrets_map={"OPENAI_API_KEY": "llm-api-key"})
```

### From disk


```python
with open("/tmp/chain.json", "r") as fp:
    chain = loads(json.load(fp), secrets_map={"OPENAI_API_KEY": "llm-api-key"})
```

Note that we recover the API key specified at the start of the guide:


```python
chain.last.openai_api_key.get_secret_value()
```




    'llm-api-key'




```python

```

# SerpAPI

This notebook goes over how to use the SerpAPI component to search the web.


```python
from langchain_community.utilities import SerpAPIWrapper
```


```python
search = SerpAPIWrapper()
```


```python
search.run("Obama's first name?")
```




    'Barack Hussein Obama II'



## Custom Parameters
You can also customize the SerpAPI wrapper with arbitrary parameters. For example, in the below example we will use `bing` instead of `google`.


```python
params = {
    "engine": "bing",
    "gl": "us",
    "hl": "en",
}
search = SerpAPIWrapper(params=params)
```


```python
search.run("Obama's first name?")
```

# Shared memory across agents and tools

This notebook goes over adding memory to **both** an Agent and its tools. Before going through this notebook, please walk through the following notebooks, as this will build on top of both of them:

- [Adding memory to an LLM Chain](/docs/modules/memory/integrations/adding_memory)
- [Custom Agents](/docs/modules/agents/how_to/custom_agent)

We are going to create a custom Agent. The agent has access to a conversation memory, search tool, and a summarization tool. The summarization tool also needs access to the conversation memory.


```python
from langchain import hub
from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor, Tool, ZeroShotAgent, create_react_agent
from langchain.chains import LLMChain
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory, ReadOnlySharedMemory
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain_community.utilities import GoogleSearchAPIWrapper
from langchain_openai import OpenAI
```


```python
template = """This is a conversation between a human and a bot:

{chat_history}

Write a summary of the conversation for {input}:
"""

prompt = PromptTemplate(input_variables=["input", "chat_history"], template=template)
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key="chat_history")
readonlymemory = ReadOnlySharedMemory(memory=memory)
summary_chain = LLMChain(
    llm=OpenAI(),
    prompt=prompt,
    verbose=True,
    memory=readonlymemory,  # use the read-only memory to prevent the tool from modifying the memory
)
```


```python
search = GoogleSearchAPIWrapper()
tools = [
    Tool(
        name="Search",
        func=search.run,
        description="useful for when you need to answer questions about current events",
    ),
    Tool(
        name="Summary",
        func=summary_chain.run,
        description="useful for when you summarize a conversation. The input to this tool should be a string, representing who will read this summary.",
    ),
]
```


```python
prompt = hub.pull("hwchase17/react")
```

We can now construct the `LLMChain`, with the Memory object, and then create the agent.


```python
model = OpenAI()
agent = create_react_agent(model, tools, prompt)
agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools, memory=memory)
```


```python
agent_executor.invoke({"input": "What is ChatGPT?"})
```

## Overview

[Sheet Music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheet_music) is the primary form of music notation used by composers and performers across the world. These pages contain information about the lyrics, pitches, rhythms, composer, text author, composition date, among others.

This notebook illustrates using Gemini to extract this metadata from sheet music PDFs.

These prompts and documents were demonstrated in the [Google Cloud Next 2024 session "What's next with Gemini: Driving business impact with multimodal use cases"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqH1R9Pk5RI).


## Getting Started


### Install Vertex AI SDK for Python


```
%pip install --upgrade --user -q google-cloud-aiplatform PyPDF2
```

### Restart current runtime

To use the newly installed packages in this Jupyter runtime, you must restart the runtime. You can do this by running the cell below, which will restart the current kernel.


```
# Restart kernel after installs so that your environment can access the new packages
import IPython

app = IPython.Application.instance()
app.kernel.do_shutdown(True)
```

<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning">
<b>⚠️ The kernel is going to restart. Please wait until it is finished before continuing to the next step. ⚠️</b>
</div>


### Authenticate your notebook environment (Colab only)

If you are running this notebook on Google Colab, run the following cell to authenticate your environment. This step is not required if you are using [Vertex AI Workbench](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai-workbench).



```
import sys

# Additional authentication is required for Google Colab
if "google.colab" in sys.modules:
    # Authenticate user to Google Cloud
    from google.colab import auth

    auth.authenticate_user()
```

### Set Google Cloud project information and initialize Vertex AI SDK

To get started using Vertex AI, you must have an existing Google Cloud project and [enable the Vertex AI API](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=aiplatform.googleapis.com).

Learn more about [setting up a project and a development environment](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/start/cloud-environment).


```
# Define project information
PROJECT_ID = "YOUR_PROJECT_ID"  # @param {type:"string"}
LOCATION = "us-central1"  # @param {type:"string"}

# Initialize Vertex AI
import vertexai

vertexai.init(project=PROJECT_ID, location=LOCATION)
```

### Import libraries



```
import json

from IPython.display import Markdown, display
import PyPDF2
from vertexai.generative_models import (
    GenerationConfig,
    GenerativeModel,
    HarmBlockThreshold,
    HarmCategory,
    Part,
)
```

### Load the Gemini 1.5 Flash model

Gemini 1.5 Flash (`gemini-1.5-flash`) is a multimodal model that supports multimodal prompts. You can include text, image(s), PDFs, audio, and video in your prompt requests and get text or code responses.


```
generation_config = GenerationConfig(temperature=1.0, max_output_tokens=8192)
safety_settings = {
    HarmCategory.HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT: HarmBlockThreshold.BLOCK_ONLY_HIGH
}
model = GenerativeModel(
    model_name="gemini-1.5-flash",
    system_instruction="You are an expert in musicology and music history.",
    generation_config=generation_config,
    safety_settings=safety_settings,
)
```

## Extract Structured Metadata from Sheet Music PDF

For this example, we will be using the popular classical music book [24 Italian Songs and Arias of the 17th and 18th Centuries](https://imslp.org/wiki/24_Italian_Songs_and_Arias_of_the_17th_and_18th_Centuries_(Various)), and extracting metadata about each song in the book.


```
sheet_music_pdf_uri = "gs://github-repo/use-cases/sheet-music/24ItalianSongs.pdf"

sheet_music_extraction_prompt = """The following document is a book of sheet music. Your task is to output structured metadata about every piece of music in the document. Correct any mistakes that are in the document and fill in missing information when not present in the document.

Include the following details:

Title
Composer with lifetime
Tempo Marking
Composition Year
A description of the piece
"""

# Load file directly from Google Cloud Storage
file_part = Part.from_uri(
    uri=sheet_music_pdf_uri,
    mime_type="application/pdf",
)

# Send to Gemini
response = model.generate_content([sheet_music_extraction_prompt, file_part])

# Display results
display(Markdown(response.text))
```

### Song Identification with Audio

Now, let's try something more challenging, identifying a song being performed based on the sheet music. We have an audio clip of Holt Skinner performing one of the songs in the book, and we will ask Gemini to identify it based on the sheet music PDF.


```
song_identification_prompt = """Based on the sheet music PDF, what song is in the audio clip? Explain how you made the decision."""

# Load PDF file
pdf_part = Part.from_uri(
    uri=sheet_music_pdf_uri,
    mime_type="application/pdf",
)

audio_part = Part.from_uri(
    uri="gs://github-repo/use-cases/sheet-music/24ItalianClip.mp3",
    mime_type="audio/mpeg",
)

# Send to Gemini
response = model.generate_content([pdf_part, audio_part, song_identification_prompt])

# Display results
display(Markdown(response.text))
```


The song is "Sebben, crudele" by Antonio Caldara. The sheet music begins with the title "Sebben, crudele" and then continues with the beginning lines of the song. 



### Edit PDF Metadata

Next, we'll use the output from Gemini to edit the metadata of a PDF containing one song, which can make it easier to organize this file in sheet music applications.

We'll adjust the prompt slightly and set the [`response_mime_type`](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/gemini#:~:text=in%20the%20list.-,responseMimeType,-(Preview)) to get the response in JSON format.


```
sheet_music_pdf_uri = "gs://github-repo/use-cases/sheet-music/SebbenCrudele.pdf"

sheet_music_extraction_prompt = """The following document is a piece of sheet music. Your task is to output structured metadata about the piece of music in the document. Correct any mistakes that are in the document and fill in missing information when not present in the document.

Output the data in the following JSON format:

{
    "/Title": "Title of the piece",
    "/Author": "Composer(s) of the piece",
    "/Subject": "Music Genre(s) in a comma separated list",
}

"""

# Load file directly from Google Cloud Storage
file_part = Part.from_uri(
    uri=sheet_music_pdf_uri,
    mime_type="application/pdf",
)

generation_config = GenerationConfig(
    temperature=1, response_mime_type="application/json"
)

# Send to Gemini
response = model.generate_content(
    [sheet_music_extraction_prompt, file_part], generation_config=generation_config
)

# Display results
display(Markdown(response.text))

new_metadata = json.loads(response.text)
```


{"/Title": "Sebben, crudele", "/Author": "Antonio Caldara", "/Subject": "Canzonetta, Aria"}



Next, we'll download the PDF from the GCS Bucket and edit the metadata using the [`PyPDF2`](https://pypdf2.readthedocs.io/en/3.x/) library.


```
! gcloud storage cp {sheet_music_pdf_uri} .
```


```
def edit_pdf_metadata(file_path: str, new_metadata: dict) -> None:
    """Edits metadata of a PDF file.

    Args:
        file_path (str): Path to the PDF file.
        new_metadata (dict): Dictionary containing the new metadata fields and values.
            Example: {'/Author': 'John Doe', '/Title': 'My Report'}
    """

    with open(file_path, "rb") as pdf_file:
        pdf_reader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(pdf_file)
        pdf_writer = PyPDF2.PdfWriter()

        for page_num in range(len(pdf_reader.pages)):
            page = pdf_reader.pages[page_num]
            pdf_writer.add_page(page)

        pdf_writer.add_metadata(new_metadata)

        with open(file_path, "wb") as out_file:
            pdf_writer.write(out_file)


edit_pdf_metadata("SebbenCrudele.pdf", new_metadata)
```

# Building a Conversational Agent with Context Awareness

## Overview
This tutorial outlines the process of creating a conversational agent that maintains context across multiple interactions. We'll use a modern AI framework to build an agent capable of engaging in more natural and coherent conversations.

## Motivation
Many simple chatbots lack the ability to maintain context, leading to disjointed and frustrating user experiences. This tutorial aims to solve that problem by implementing a conversational agent that can remember and refer to previous parts of the conversation, enhancing the overall interaction quality.

## Key Components
1. **Language Model**: The core AI component that generates responses.
2. **Prompt Template**: Defines the structure of our conversations.
3. **History Manager**: Manages conversation history and context.
4. **Message Store**: Stores the messages for each conversation session.

## Method Details

### Setting Up the Environment
Begin by setting up the necessary AI framework and ensuring access to a suitable language model. This forms the foundation of our conversational agent.

### Creating the Chat History Store
Implement a system to manage multiple conversation sessions. Each session should be uniquely identifiable and associated with its own message history.

### Defining the Conversation Structure
Create a template that includes:
- A system message defining the AI's role
- A placeholder for conversation history
- The user's input

This structure guides the AI's responses and maintains consistency throughout the conversation.

### Building the Conversational Chain
Combine the prompt template with the language model to create a basic conversational chain. Wrap this chain with a history management component that automatically handles the insertion and retrieval of conversation history.

### Interacting with the Agent
To use the agent, invoke it with a user input and a session identifier. The history manager takes care of retrieving the appropriate conversation history, inserting it into the prompt, and storing new messages after each interaction.

## Conclusion
This approach to creating a conversational agent offers several advantages:
- **Context Awareness**: The agent can refer to previous parts of the conversation, leading to more natural interactions.
- **Simplicity**: The modular design keeps the implementation straightforward.
- **Flexibility**: It's easy to modify the conversation structure or switch to a different language model.
- **Scalability**: The session-based approach allows for managing multiple independent conversations.

With this foundation, you can further enhance the agent by:
- Implementing more sophisticated prompt engineering
- Integrating it with external knowledge bases
- Adding specialized capabilities for specific domains
- Incorporating error handling and conversation repair strategies

By focusing on context management, this conversational agent design significantly improves upon basic chatbot functionality, paving the way for more engaging and helpful AI assistants.

# Conversational Agent Tutorial

This notebook demonstrates how to create a simple conversational agent using LangChain.

### Import required libraries


```python
# %pip install -q langchain langchain_experimental openai python-dotenv langchain_openai
```


```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_core.runnables.history import RunnableWithMessageHistory
from langchain.memory import ChatMessageHistory
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')
```

### Load environment variables and initialize the language model


```python
load_dotenv()
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini", max_tokens=1000, temperature=0)
```

###  Create a simple in-memory store for chat histories



```python
store = {}

def get_chat_history(session_id: str):
    if session_id not in store:
        store[session_id] = ChatMessageHistory()
    return store[session_id]
```

### Create the prompt template



```python
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
    ("system", "You are a helpful AI assistant."),
    MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name="history"),
    ("human", "{input}")
])
```

### Combine the prompt and model into a runnable chain



```python
chain = prompt | llm
```

### Wrap the chain with message history



```python
chain_with_history = RunnableWithMessageHistory(
    chain,
    get_chat_history,
    input_messages_key="input",
    history_messages_key="history"
)
```

### Example usage


```python
session_id = "user_123"


response1 = chain_with_history.invoke(
    {"input": "Hello! How are you?"},
    config={"configurable": {"session_id": session_id}}
)
print("AI:", response1.content)

response2 = chain_with_history.invoke(
    {"input": "What was my previous message?"},
    config={"configurable": {"session_id": session_id}}
)
print("AI:", response2.content)

```

    AI: Hello! I'm just a computer program, so I don't have feelings, but I'm here and ready to help you. How can I assist you today?
    AI: Your previous message was, "Hello! How are you?" How can I assist you further?
    

### Print the conversation history


```python
print("\nConversation History:")
for message in store[session_id].messages:
    print(f"{message.type}: {message.content}")
```

    
    Conversation History:
    human: Hello! How are you?
    ai: Hello! I'm just a computer program, so I don't have feelings, but I'm here and ready to help you. How can I assist you today?
    human: What was my previous message?
    ai: Your previous message was, "Hello! How are you?" How can I assist you further?

## Overview

This code implements a basic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for processing and querying CSV documents. The system encodes the document content into a vector store, which can then be queried to retrieve relevant information.

# CSV File Structure and Use Case
The CSV file contains dummy customer data, comprising various attributes like first name, last name, company, etc. This dataset will be utilized for a RAG use case, facilitating the creation of a customer information Q&A system.

1. The csv is loaded using LlamaIndex's [PagedCSVReader](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/api_reference/readers/file/#llama_index.readers.file.PagedCSVReader)
2. This reader converts each row into a LlamaIndex Document along with the respective column names of the table. No further splitting applied.


### Vector Store Creation

1. OpenAI embeddings are used to create vector representations of the text chunks.
2. A FAISS vector store is created from these embeddings for efficient similarity search.

### Query Engine Setup

1. A query engine is configured to fetch the most relevant chunks for a given query then answer the question.

## Benefits of this Approach

1. Scalability: Can handle large documents by processing them in chunks.
2. Flexibility: Easy to adjust parameters like chunk size and number of retrieved results.
3. Efficiency: Utilizes FAISS for fast similarity search in high-dimensional spaces.
4. Integration with Advanced NLP: Uses OpenAI embeddings for state-of-the-art text representation.

## Conclusion

This simple RAG system provides a solid foundation for building more complex information retrieval and question-answering systems. By encoding document content into a searchable vector store, it enables efficient retrieval of relevant information in response to queries. This approach is particularly useful for applications requiring quick access to specific information within a CSV file.

1. Language Model: Processes natural language queries and generates human-like responses
2. Data Manipulation Framework: Handles dataset operations and analysis
3. Agent Framework: Connects the language model with data manipulation tools
4. Synthetic Dataset: Represents real-world data for demonstration purposes

## Method
1. Create a synthetic dataset representing car sales data
2. Construct an agent that combines the language model with data analysis capabilities
3. Implement a query processing function to handle natural language questions
4. Demonstrate the agent's abilities with example queries

## Conclusion
This approach to data analysis offers significant benefits:
- Accessibility for non-technical users

## Create Data Analysis Agent

Here, we create a Pandas DataFrame agent using LangChain. This agent will be capable of analyzing our dataset and answering questions about it.


```python
# Create the Pandas DataFrame agent
agent = create_pandas_dataframe_agent(
    ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o", temperature=0),
    df,
    verbose=True,
    allow_dangerous_code=True,
    agent_type=AgentType.OPENAI_FUNCTIONS,
)
print("Data Analysis Agent is ready. You can now ask questions about the data.")
```

    Data Analysis Agent is ready. You can now ask questions about the data.
    

## Define Question-Asking Function

This function allows us to easily ask questions to our data analysis agent and display the results.


```python
def ask_agent(question):
    """Function to ask questions to the agent and display the response"""
    response = agent.run({
        "input": question,
        "agent_scratchpad": f"Human: {question}\nAI: To answer this question, I need to use Python to analyze the dataframe. I'll use the python_repl_ast tool.\n\nAction: python_repl_ast\nAction Input: ",
    })
    print(f"Question: {question}")
    print(f"Answer: {response}")
    print("---")
```

## Example Questions

Here are some example questions you can ask the data analysis agent. You can modify these or add your own questions to analyze the dataset.


```python
# Example questions
ask_agent("What are the column names in this dataset?")
ask_agent("How many rows are in this dataset?")
ask_agent("What is the average price of cars sold?")

# Simple RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) System

## Overview

This code implements a basic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for processing and querying PDF documents. The system encodes the document content into a vector store, which can then be queried to retrieve relevant information.

## Key Components

1. PDF processing and text extraction
2. Text chunking for manageable processing
3. Vector store creation using [FAISS](https://engineering.fb.com/2017/03/29/data-infrastructure/faiss-a-library-for-efficient-similarity-search/) and OpenAI embeddings
4. Retriever setup for querying the processed documents
5. Evaluation of the RAG system

## Method Details

### Document Preprocessing

1. The PDF is loaded using PyPDFLoader.
2. The text is split into chunks using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter with specified chunk size and overlap.

### Text Cleaning

A custom function `replace_t_with_space` is applied to clean the text chunks. This likely addresses specific formatting issues in the PDF.

### Vector Store Creation

1. OpenAI embeddings are used to create vector representations of the text chunks.
2. A FAISS vector store is created from these embeddings for efficient similarity search.

### Retriever Setup

1. A retriever is configured to fetch the top 2 most relevant chunks for a given query.

### Encoding Function

The `encode_pdf` function encapsulates the entire process of loading, chunking, cleaning, and encoding the PDF into a vector store.

## Key Features

1. Modular Design: The encoding process is encapsulated in a single function for easy reuse.
2. Configurable Chunking: Allows adjustment of chunk size and overlap.
3. Efficient Retrieval: Uses FAISS for fast similarity search.
4. Evaluation: Includes a function to evaluate the RAG system's performance.

## Usage Example

The code includes a test query: "What is the main cause of climate change?". This demonstrates how to use the retriever to fetch relevant context from the processed document.

## Evaluation

The system includes an `evaluate_rag` function to assess the performance of the retriever, though the specific metrics used are not detailed in the provided code.

## Benefits of this Approach

1. Scalability: Can handle large documents by processing them in chunks.
2. Flexibility: Easy to adjust parameters like chunk size and number of retrieved results.
3. Efficiency: Utilizes FAISS for fast similarity search in high-dimensional spaces.
4. Integration with Advanced NLP: Uses OpenAI embeddings for state-of-the-art text representation.

## Conclusion

This simple RAG system provides a solid foundation for building more complex information retrieval and question-answering systems. By encoding document content into a searchable vector store, it enables efficient retrieval of relevant information in response to queries. This approach is particularly useful for applications requiring quick access to specific information within large documents or document collections.

### Import libraries and environment variables


```python
import os

    driven by human activities, particularly the emission of greenhou se gases.  
    Chapter 2: Causes of Climate Change  
    Greenhouse Gases  
    The primary cause of recent climate change is the increase in greenhouse gases in the 
    atmosphere. Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous 
    oxide (N2O), trap heat from the sun, creating a "greenhouse effect." This effect is  essential 
    for life on Earth, as it keeps the planet warm enough to support life. However, human 
    activities have intensified this natural process, leading to a warmer climate.  
    Fossil Fuels  
    Burning fossil fuels for energy releases large amounts of CO2. This includes coal, oil, and 
    natural gas used for electricity, heating, and transportation. The industrial revolution marked 
    the beginning of a significant increase in fossil fuel consumption, which continues to rise 
    today.  
    Coal
    
    
    Context 2:
    Most of these climate changes are attributed to very small variations in Earth's orbit that 
    change the amount of solar energy our planet receives. During the Holocene epoch, which 
    began at the end of the last ice age, human societies f lourished, but the industrial era has seen 
    unprecedented changes.  
    Modern Observations  
    Modern scientific observations indicate a rapid increase in global temperatures, sea levels, 
    and extreme weather events. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has 
    documented these changes extensively. Ice core samples, tree rings, and ocean sediments

# Simple RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) System

## Overview

This code implements a basic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for processing and querying PDF document(s). The system uses a pipeline that encodes the documents and creates nodes. These nodes then can be used to build a vector index to retrieve relevant information.

## Key Components

1. PDF processing and text extraction
2. Text chunking for manageable processing
3. Ingestion pipeline creation using FAISS as vector store and OpenAI embeddings
4. Retriever setup for querying the processed documents
5. Evaluation of the RAG system

## Method Details

### Document Preprocessing

1. The PDF is loaded using [SimpleDirectoryReader](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/module_guides/loading/simpledirectoryreader/).
2. The text is split into [nodes/chunks](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/module_guides/loading/documents_and_nodes/) using [SentenceSplitter](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/module_guides/loading/node_parsers/modules/#sentencesplitter) with specified chunk size and overlap.

### Text Cleaning

A custom transformation `TextCleaner` is applied to clean the texts. This likely addresses specific formatting issues in the PDF.

### Ingestion Pipeline Creation

1. OpenAI embeddings are used to create vector representations of the text nodes.
2. A FAISS vector store is created from these embeddings for efficient similarity search.

### Retriever Setup

1. A retriever is configured to fetch the top 2 most relevant chunks for a given query.


## Key Features

1. Modular Design: The ingestion process is encapsulated in a single function for easy reuse.
2. Configurable Chunking: Allows adjustment of chunk size and overlap.
3. Efficient Retrieval: Uses FAISS for fast similarity search.
4. Evaluation: Includes a function to evaluate the RAG system's performance.

## Usage Example

The code includes a test query: "What is the main cause of climate change?". This demonstrates how to use the retriever to fetch relevant context from the processed document.

## Evaluation

The system includes an `evaluate_rag` function to assess the performance of the retriever, though the specific metrics used are not detailed in the provided code.

## Benefits of this Approach

1. Scalability: Can handle large documents by processing them in chunks.
2. Flexibility: Easy to adjust parameters like chunk size and number of retrieved results.
3. Efficiency: Utilizes FAISS for fast similarity search in high-dimensional spaces.
4. Integration with Advanced NLP: Uses OpenAI embeddings for state-of-the-art text representation.

## Conclusion

This simple RAG system provides a solid foundation for building more complex information retrieval and question-answering systems. By encoding document content into a searchable vector store, it enables efficient retrieval of relevant information in response to queries. This approach is particularly useful for applications requiring quick access to specific information within large documents or document collections.

### Import libraries and environment variables

sys.path.append(os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.getcwd(), '..'))) # Add the parent directory to the path sicnce we work with notebooks

EMBED_DIMENSION = 512

# Chunk settings are way different than langchain examples
# Beacuse for the chunk length langchain uses length of the string,
# while llamaindex uses length of the tokens
CHUNK_SIZE = 200
CHUNK_OVERLAP = 50

# Load environment variables from a .env file
load_dotenv()

# Set the OpenAI API key environment variable
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')

# Set embeddig model on LlamaIndex global settings
Settings.embed_model = OpenAIEmbedding(model="text-embedding-3-small", dimensions=EMBED_DIMENSION)
```

### Read Docs


```python
path = "../data/"
node_parser = SimpleDirectoryReader(input_dir=path, required_exts=['.pdf'])
documents = node_parser.load_data()
print(documents[0])
```

### Vector Store


```python
# Create FaisVectorStore to store embeddings
faiss_index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(EMBED_DIMENSION)
vector_store = FaissVectorStore(faiss_index=faiss_index)
```

### Text Cleaner Transformation


```python
class TextCleaner(TransformComponent):
    """
    Transformation to be used within the ingestion pipeline.
    Cleans clutters from texts.
    """
    def __call__(self, nodes, **kwargs) -> List[BaseNode]:
        
        for node in nodes:
            node.text = node.text.replace('\t', ' ') # Replace tabs with spaces
            node.text = node.text.replace(' \n', ' ') # Replace paragraph seperator with spacaes
            
        return nodes
```

### Ingestion Pipeline


```python
text_splitter = SentenceSplitter(chunk_size=CHUNK_SIZE, chunk_overlap=CHUNK_OVERLAP)

# Create a pipeline with defined document transformations and vectorstore
pipeline = IngestionPipeline(
    transformations=[
        TextCleaner(),
        text_splitter,
    ],
    vector_store=vector_store, 
)
```


```python
# Run pipeline and get generated nodes from the process
nodes = pipeline.run(documents=documents)
```

### Create retriever


```python
vector_store_index = VectorStoreIndex(nodes)
retriever = vector_store_index.as_retriever(similarity_top_k=2)
```

### Test retriever


```python
def show_context(context):
    """
    Display the contents of the provided context list.

    Args:
        context (list): A list of context items to be displayed.

    Prints each context item in the list with a heading indicating its position.
    """
    for i, c in enumerate(context):
        print(f"Context {i+1}:")
        print(c.text)
        print("\n")
```


```python
test_query = "What is the main cause of climate change?"
context = retriever.retrieve(test_query)
show_context(context)
```

    Context 1:
    Chapter 2: Causes of Climate Change  Greenhouse Gases  The primary cause of recent climate change is the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), trap heat from the sun, creating a "greenhouse effect." This effect is  essential for life on Earth, as it keeps the planet warm enough to support life. However, human activities have intensified this natural process, leading to a warmer climate.  Fossil Fuels  Burning fossil fuels for energy releases large amounts of CO2.
    
    
    Context 2:
    The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has documented these changes extensively. Ice core samples, tree rings, and ocean sediments provide a historical record that scientists use to understand past climate conditions and predict future trends. The evidence overwhelmingly shows that recent changes are primarily driven by human activities, particularly the emission of greenhou se gases.  Chapter 2: Causes of Climate Change  Greenhouse Gases  The primary cause of recent climate change is the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

# Building a Travel Planner with LangGraph: A Tutorial

## Overview

This tutorial guides you through the process of creating a simple Travel Planner using LangGraph, a library for building stateful, multi-step applications with language models. The Travel Planner demonstrates how to structure a conversational AI application that collects user input and generates personalized travel itineraries.

## Motivation

In the realm of AI applications, managing state and flow in multi-step processes can be challenging. LangGraph provides a solution by allowing developers to create graph-based workflows that can handle complex interactions while maintaining a clear and modular structure. This Travel Planner serves as a practical example of how to leverage LangGraph's capabilities to build a useful and interactive application.

## Key Components

1. **StateGraph**: The core of our application, defining the flow of our Travel Planner.
2. **PlannerState**: A custom type representing the state of our planning process.
3. **Node Functions**: Individual steps in our planning process (input_city, input_interests, create_itinerary).
4. **LLM Integration**: Utilizing a language model to generate the final itinerary.

## Method Details

Our Travel Planner follows a straightforward, three-step process:

1. **City Input**: 
   - The application prompts the user to enter the city they want to visit.
   - This information is stored in the state.

2. **Interests Input**:
   - The user is asked to provide their interests for the trip.
   - These interests are stored as a list in the state.

3. **Itinerary Creation**:
   - Using the collected city and interests, the application leverages a language model to generate a personalized day trip itinerary.
   - The generated itinerary is presented to the user.

The flow between these steps is managed by LangGraph, which handles the state transitions and ensures that each step is executed in the correct order.

## Conclusion

This tutorial demonstrates how LangGraph can be used to create a simple yet effective Travel Planner. By structuring our application as a graph of interconnected nodes, we achieve a clear separation of concerns and a easily modifiable workflow. This approach can be extended to more complex applications, showcasing the power and flexibility of graph-based designs in AI-driven conversational interfaces.

The Travel Planner serves as a starting point for developers looking to build more sophisticated stateful applications using language models. It illustrates key concepts such as state management, user input handling, and integration with AI models, all within the framework provided by LangGraph.

### Setup and Imports

First, let's import the necessary modules and set up our environment.


```python
import os
from typing import TypedDict, Annotated, List
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage, AIMessage
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_core.runnables.graph import MermaidDrawMethod
from IPython.display import display, Image
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os
load_dotenv()
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')
```

### Define Agent State

We'll define the state that our agent will maintain throughout its operation.


```python
class PlannerState(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[List[HumanMessage | AIMessage], "The messages in the conversation"]
    city: str
    interests: List[str]
    itinerary: str
```

### Set Up Language Model and Prompts



```python
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini")


itinerary_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
    ("system", "You are a helpful travel assistant. Create a day trip itinerary for {city} based on the user's interests: {interests}. Provide a brief, bulleted itinerary."),
    ("human", "Create an itinerary for my day trip."),
])
```

### Define Agent Functions

Now we'll define the main functions that our agent will use: get city, get interests, create itinerary


```python
def input_city(state: PlannerState) -> PlannerState:
    print("Please enter the city you want to visit for your day trip:")
    user_message = input("Your input: ")
    return {
        **state,
        "city": user_message,
        "messages": state['messages'] + [HumanMessage(content=user_message)],
    }

def input_interests(state: PlannerState) -> PlannerState:
    print(f"Please enter your interests for the trip to {state['city']} (comma-separated):")
    user_message = input("Your input: ")
    return {
        **state,
        "interests": [interest.strip() for interest in user_message.split(',')],
        "messages": state['messages'] + [HumanMessage(content=user_message)],
    }

def create_itinerary(state: PlannerState) -> PlannerState:
    print(f"Creating an itinerary for {state['city']} based on interests: {', '.join(state['interests'])}...")
    response = llm.invoke(itinerary_prompt.format_messages(city=state['city'], interests=", ".join(state['interests'])))
    print("\nFinal Itinerary:")
    print(response.content)
    return {
        **state,
        "messages": state['messages'] + [AIMessage(content=response.content)],
        "itinerary": response.content,
    }
```

### Create and Compile the Graph

Now we'll create our LangGraph workflow and compile it.


```python
workflow = StateGraph(PlannerState)

workflow.add_node("input_city", input_city)
workflow.add_node("input_interests", input_interests)
workflow.add_node("create_itinerary", create_itinerary)

workflow.set_entry_point("input_city")

workflow.add_edge("input_city", "input_interests")
workflow.add_edge("input_interests", "create_itinerary")
workflow.add_edge("create_itinerary", END)

app = workflow.compile()
```

### Display the graph structure


```python
display(
    Image(
        app.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png(
            draw_method=MermaidDrawMethod.API,
        )
    )
)
```


    
![jpeg](output_12_0.jpg)
    


### Define the function that runs the graph


```python
def run_travel_planner(user_request: str):
    print(f"Initial Request: {user_request}\n")
    state = {
        "messages": [HumanMessage(content=user_request)],
        "city": "",
        "interests": [],
        "itinerary": "",
    }
    
    for output in app.stream(state):
        pass  # The nodes themselves now handle all printing
```

### Use case example


```python
user_request = "I want to plan a day trip."
run_travel_planner(user_request)
```

    Initial Request: I want to plan a day trip.
    
    Please enter the city you want to visit for your day trip:
    

    Please enter your interests for the trip to paris (comma-separated):

################################################## sitemap.md ##################################################


# Sitemap

Extends from the `WebBaseLoader`, `SitemapLoader` loads a sitemap from a given URL, and then scrapes and loads all pages in the sitemap, returning each page as a Document.

The scraping is done concurrently. There are reasonable limits to concurrent requests, defaulting to 2 per second.  If you aren't concerned about being a good citizen, or you control the scrapped server, or don't care about load you can increase this limit. Note, while this will speed up the scraping process, it may cause the server to block you. Be careful!

    {'source': 'https://api.python.langchain.com/en/stable/', 'loc': 'https://api.python.langchain.com/en/stable/', 'lastmod': '2024-05-15T00:29:42.163001+00:00', 'changefreq': 'weekly', 'priority': '1'}
    

You can change the `requests_per_second` parameter to increase the max concurrent requests. and use `requests_kwargs` to pass kwargs when send requests.


```python
sitemap_loader.requests_per_second = 2
# Optional: avoid `[SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED]` issue
sitemap_loader.requests_kwargs = {"verify": False}
```

## Lazy Load

You can also load the pages lazily in order to minimize the memory load.


```python
page = []
for doc in sitemap_loader.lazy_load():
    page.append(doc)
    if len(page) >= 10:
        # do some paged operation, e.g.
        # index.upsert(page)

        page = []
```

    Fetching pages: 100%|##########| 28/28 [00:01<00:00, 19.06it/s]
    

## Filtering sitemap URLs

Sitemaps can be massive files, with thousands of URLs.  Often you don't need every single one of them.  You can filter the URLs by passing a list of strings or regex patterns to the `filter_urls` parameter.  Only URLs that match one of the patterns will be loaded.


```python
loader = SitemapLoader(
    web_path="https://api.python.langchain.com/sitemap.xml",
    filter_urls=["https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest"],
)
documents = loader.load()
```


```python
documents[0]
```




    Document(page_content='\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLangChain Python API Reference Documentation.\n\n\nYou will be automatically redirected to the new location of this page.\n\n', metadata={'source': 'https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/', 'loc': 'https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/', 'lastmod': '2024-02-12T05:26:10.971077+00:00', 'changefreq': 'daily', 'priority': '0.9'})



## Add custom scraping rules

The `SitemapLoader` uses `beautifulsoup4` for the scraping process, and it scrapes every element on the page by default. The `SitemapLoader` constructor accepts a custom scraping function. This feature can be helpful to tailor the scraping process to your specific needs; for example, you might want to avoid scraping headers or navigation elements.

 The following example shows how to develop and use a custom function to avoid navigation and header elements.

Import the `beautifulsoup4` library and define the custom function.


```python
pip install beautifulsoup4
```


```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup


def remove_nav_and_header_elements(content: BeautifulSoup) -> str:
    # Find all 'nav' and 'header' elements in the BeautifulSoup object
    nav_elements = content.find_all("nav")
    header_elements = content.find_all("header")

    # Remove each 'nav' and 'header' element from the BeautifulSoup object
    for element in nav_elements + header_elements:
        element.decompose()

    return str(content.get_text())
```

Add your custom function to the `SitemapLoader` object.


```python
loader = SitemapLoader(
    "https://api.python.langchain.com/sitemap.xml",
    filter_urls=["https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/"],
    parsing_function=remove_nav_and_header_elements,
)
```

## Local Sitemap

The sitemap loader can also be used to load local files.


```python
sitemap_loader = SitemapLoader(web_path="example_data/sitemap.xml", is_local=True)

docs = sitemap_loader.load()
```

## API reference

# scikit-learn

>[scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) is an open-source collection of machine learning algorithms, including some implementations of the [k nearest neighbors](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.NearestNeighbors.html). `SKLearnVectorStore` wraps this implementation and adds the possibility to persist the vector store in json, bson (binary json) or Apache Parquet format.

This notebook shows how to use the `SKLearnVectorStore` vector database.

You'll need to install `langchain-community` with `pip install -qU langchain-community` to use this integration


```python
%pip install --upgrade --quiet  scikit-learn

# # if you plan to use bson serialization, install also:
%pip install --upgrade --quiet  bson

# # if you plan to use parquet serialization, install also:
%pip install --upgrade --quiet  pandas pyarrow
```

To use OpenAI embeddings, you will need an OpenAI key. You can get one at https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys or feel free to use any other embeddings.


```python
import os
from getpass import getpass

if "OPENAI_API_KEY" not in os.environ:
    os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = getpass("Enter your OpenAI key:")
```

## Basic usage

### Load a sample document corpus


```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import TextLoader
from langchain_community.vectorstores import SKLearnVectorStore
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain_text_splitters import CharacterTextSplitter

loader = TextLoader("../../how_to/state_of_the_union.txt")
documents = loader.load()
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
docs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
```

### Create the SKLearnVectorStore, index the document corpus and run a sample query


```python
import tempfile

persist_path = os.path.join(tempfile.gettempdir(), "union.parquet")

vector_store = SKLearnVectorStore.from_documents(
    documents=docs,
    embedding=embeddings,
    persist_path=persist_path,  # persist_path and serializer are optional
    serializer="parquet",
)

query = "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"
docs = vector_store.similarity_search(query)
print(docs[0].page_content)
```

    Tonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you’re at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections. 
    
    Tonight, I’d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer—an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service. 
    
    One of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court. 
    
    And I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation’s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence.
    

## Saving and loading a vector store


```python
vector_store.persist()
print("Vector store was persisted to", persist_path)
```

    Vector store was persisted to /var/folders/6r/wc15p6m13nl_nl_n_xfqpc5c0000gp/T/union.parquet
    


```python
vector_store2 = SKLearnVectorStore(
    embedding=embeddings, persist_path=persist_path, serializer="parquet"
)
print("A new instance of vector store was loaded from", persist_path)
```

    A new instance of vector store was loaded from /var/folders/6r/wc15p6m13nl_nl_n_xfqpc5c0000gp/T/union.parquet
    


```python
docs = vector_store2.similarity_search(query)
print(docs[0].page_content)
```

    Tonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you’re at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections. 
    
    Tonight, I’d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer—an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service.

    And I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation’s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence.
    

## Clean-up


```python
os.remove(persist_path)
```




################################################## slack.md ##################################################


# Slack

This notebook shows how to use the Slack chat loader. This class helps map exported slack conversations to LangChain chat messages.

The process has three steps:
1. Export the desired conversation thread by following the [instructions here](https://slack.com/help/articles/1500001548241-Request-to-export-all-conversations).
2. Create the `SlackChatLoader` with the file path pointed to the json file or directory of JSON files
3. Call `loader.load()` (or `loader.lazy_load()`) to perform the conversion. Optionally use `merge_chat_runs` to combine message from the same sender in sequence, and/or `map_ai_messages` to convert messages from the specified sender to the "AIMessage" class.

## 1. Create message dump

Currently (2023/08/23) this loader best supports a zip directory of files in the format generated by exporting your a direct message conversation from Slack. Follow up-to-date instructions from slack on how to do so.

We have an example in the LangChain repo.


```python
import requests

permalink = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/langchain-ai/langchain/342087bdfa3ac31d622385d0f2d09cf5e06c8db3/libs/langchain/tests/integration_tests/examples/slack_export.zip"
response = requests.get(permalink)
with open("slack_dump.zip", "wb") as f:
    f.write(response.content)
```

## 2. Create the Chat Loader

Provide the loader with the file path to the zip directory. You can optionally specify the user id that maps to an ai message as well an configure whether to merge message runs.


```python
from langchain_community.chat_loaders.slack import SlackChatLoader
```


```python
loader = SlackChatLoader(
    path="slack_dump.zip",
)
```

## 3. Load messages

The `load()` (or `lazy_load`) methods return a list of "ChatSessions" that currently just contain a list of messages per loaded conversation.


```python
from typing import List

from langchain_community.chat_loaders.utils import (
    map_ai_messages,
    merge_chat_runs,
)
from langchain_core.chat_sessions import ChatSession

raw_messages = loader.lazy_load()
# Merge consecutive messages from the same sender into a single message
merged_messages = merge_chat_runs(raw_messages)
# Convert messages from "U0500003428" to AI messages
messages: List[ChatSession] = list(
    map_ai_messages(merged_messages, sender="U0500003428")
)
```

### Next Steps

You can then use these messages how you see fit, such as fine-tuning a model, few-shot example selection, or directly make predictions for the next message. 


```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI()

for chunk in llm.stream(messages[1]["messages"]):
    print(chunk.content, end="", flush=True)
```

    Hi, 
    
    I hope you're doing well. I wanted to reach out and ask if you'd be available to meet up for coffee sometime next week. I'd love to catch up and hear about what's been going on in your life. Let me know if you're interested and we can find a time that works for both of us. 
    
    Looking forward to hearing from you!
    
    Best, [Your Name]

Authors: [Keith Ballinger](https://github.com/keithballinger), [Megan O'Keefe](https://github.com/askmeegs) 

Small-to-big retrieval is a form of [modular recursive RAG](https://www.promptingguide.ai/research/rag#modular-rag), where you link smaller grounding data chunks to larger "parent" data chunks. When a small chunk is retrieved at runtime, the larger linked chunk can be retrieved if needed.  

The Small-to-big strategy offers a few benefits over regular RAG: 
1. **Complex use cases**: Small-to-big RAG can be used to handle complex queries where the context is too large to fit into a single dense vector. Examples: legal documents, research papers. 
2. **Work around the limits of dense vectors**: Dense vectors can only "squish" the meaning of a text so much. If you try to embed a chunk that's too long (eg. an entire document), some of the meaning may be lost, resulting in less accurate retrieval results. By keeping the small vector chunks small, and retrieving large documents later (with or without embeddings), you're getting the semantic-search benefits of dense vectors, while still being able to retrieve the full context when needed.
3. **Cost**: You can set up small-to-big RAG to only fetch the long documents when needed (eg. if the model is unable to respond with the small context). This can save on inference costs, because Gemini on Vertex AI is [priced per input character](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/pricing). 

There are multiple ways to implement small-to-big RAG. The small chunks could represent short passages of a document, and the larger chunks could represent the entire surrounding context (eg. the whole document) - see LangChain's [ParentDocumentRetriever](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/parent_document_retriever) for more info. Another way is to have the small chunks represent summaries of the larger documents. That is the method we'll explore here. 


In this example, we'll walk through a Small-to-big RAG example using a GitHub codebase called [Online Boutique](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo). Online Boutique is a microservices, multi-language sample application. We'll implement a question answering functionality to help a new contributor learn about and navigate this codebase.

![](architecture.png)

To complete this notebook, **you will need**: 
- A [Google Cloud account](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
- One [Google Cloud project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects) with [billing](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project) enabled 
- Enable the [Vertex AI API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/start/cloud-environment)
- [gcloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) installed in your environment.
- Your user has the **Vertex AI User** IAM role.

This notebook uses the following products and tools:
- [Vertex AI - Gemini API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/start/quickstarts/quickstart-multimodal#gemini-beginner-samples-python_vertex_ai_sdk) 
- [Vertex AI - Text Embeddings API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/embeddings/get-text-embeddings) 
- [Chroma](https://docs.trychroma.com/getting-started) (in-memory vector database)  


### Setup 

First, set variables. You are required to set your project ID. You can keep the other variables as-is.


```
EMBEDDING_MODEL = "textembedding-gecko@003"
GENERATIVE_MODEL = "gemini-1.0-pro"
PROJECT_ID = "YOUR-PROJECT-ID"
REGION = "us-central1"
```

Install the necessary packages, and import them. 


```
%pip install "google-cloud-aiplatform>=1.38"
%pip install pandas
%pip install chromadb
```


```
import os

import chromadb
import pandas as pd
import vertexai
from vertexai.generative_models import ChatSession, GenerativeModel
from vertexai.language_models import TextEmbeddingModel
```

Lastly, download the source code dataset from Cloud Storage. This is a modified version of the upstream Online Boutique repo, with certain files pruned for sample purposes.


```
! gsutil -m cp -r gs://github-repo/generative-ai/gemini/use-cases/rag/small-to-big-rag/onlineboutique-codefiles .
```

### Create helper functions

We'll create one function that calls Vertex AI text-embeddings-gecko, and another that inferences Gemini Pro on Vertex AI.


```
model = TextEmbeddingModel.from_pretrained(EMBEDDING_MODEL)


def get_text_embedding(doc) -> list:
    embeddings = model.get_embeddings([doc])
    if len(embeddings) > 1:
        raise ValueError("More than one embedding returned.")
    if len(embeddings) == 0:
        raise ValueError("No embedding returned.")
    return embeddings[0].values
```


```
vertexai.init(project=PROJECT_ID, location=REGION)
model = GenerativeModel(GENERATIVE_MODEL)
chat = model.start_chat()
```


```
def gemini_inference(chat: ChatSession, prompt: str) -> str:
    text_response = chat.generate_content(prompt)
    return text_response.text
```


```
gemini_inference(chat, "hello world!")
```




    'Bonjour le monde!'



### Get summaries of code files 

First, we'll use Gemini on Vertex AI to get short summaries of each code file.  We'll do this by recursively traversing the files in `onlineboutique-codefiles`. 


```
# for every file in onlineboutique-codefiles/, read it in, and get the full tree filename, and a code summary
summaries = {}
for root, dirs, files in os.walk("onlineboutique-codefiles/"):
    for file in files:
        temp = {}
        full_file_path = os.path.join(root, file)
        with open(full_file_path) as f:
            print("Processing file: ", full_file_path)
            try:
                content = f.read()
                temp["content"] = content
                prompt = """ 
                You are a helpful code summarizer. Here is a source code file. Please identify the programming language and summarize it in three sentences or less. Give as much detail as possible, including function names and libraries used. Code: 
                {}
                """.format(
                    content
                )
                summary = gemini_inference(chat, prompt)
                temp["summary"] = summary
                summaries[full_file_path] = temp
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"⚠️ Error processing file: {full_file_path} - {e}")
```

Next, we'll create a Pandas DataFrame with the file paths, code content, and summaries.


```
df = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(summaries, orient="index")
```


```
df.head()
```

# write to csv
df.to_csv("code_summaries.csv", index=False)
```

### Convert summaries to embeddings

Next, we'll convert the text summaries of each code file to vector embeddings. We'll store those embeddings in an in-memory Chroma database. 


```
chroma_client = chromadb.Client()
```


```
collection = chroma_client.create_collection(name="code_summaries")
```


```
# iterate over dataframe. convert summary into embeddings. insert summary into collection.
for index, row in df.iterrows():
    fn = row["filename"]
    print("Getting embedding for: ", fn)
    summary = row["summary"]
    print(summary)
    e = get_text_embedding(summary)
    print(e)
    # add vector embedding to in-memory Chroma database.
    # the "small" summary embedding is linked to the "big" raw code file through the metadata key, "filename."
    collection.add(
        embeddings=[e], documents=[summary], metadatas=[{"filename": fn}], ids=[fn]
    )
```

### Implement the Small-to-big RAG workflow 


```
# Get a list of all files to pass to Gemini, if it needs to see a specific code file.
all_files = []
for root, dirs, files in os.walk("onlineboutique-codefiles/"):
    for file in files:
        all_files.append(os.path.join(root, file))
print(all_files)
```

The function below shows how we'll first try to inference Gemini with small chunks (code file summaries). If Gemini can answer with that context, we return its response and we're done. If Gemini needs more context, we'll ask it what file it would like to see. Then, we'll directly retrieve the code file from the DataFrame, and pass it into Gemini again as the "large" context.


```
def small_to_big(user_prompt):
    # SMALL: first, run RAG with the summary embeddings to try to get a response
    query_emb = get_text_embedding(user_prompt)
    result = collection.query(query_embeddings=[query_emb], n_results=3)

You can test this function by calling `small_to_big("your codebase question")`. We include a few examples below. The more detailed your question (eg. citing a specific function, line of code, or dependency), the more likely it is that Gemini will ask for more context, and the "large" step occurs.

# How to use a SmartLLMChain

A SmartLLMChain is a form of self-critique chain that can help you if have particularly complex questions to answer. Instead of doing a single LLM pass, it instead performs these 3 steps:
1. Ideation: Pass the user prompt n times through the LLM to get n output proposals (called "ideas"), where n is a parameter you can set 
2. Critique: The LLM critiques all ideas to find possible flaws and picks the best one 
3. Resolve: The LLM tries to improve upon the best idea (as chosen in the critique step) and outputs it. This is then the final output.

SmartLLMChains are based on the SmartGPT workflow proposed in https://youtu.be/wVzuvf9D9BU.

Note that SmartLLMChains
- use more LLM passes (ie n+2 instead of just 1)
- only work then the underlying LLM has the capability for reflection, which smaller models often don't
- only work with underlying models that return exactly 1 output, not multiple

This notebook demonstrates how to use a SmartLLMChain.

##### Same LLM for all steps


```python
import os

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "..."
```


```python
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain_experimental.smart_llm import SmartLLMChain
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
```

As example question, we will use "I have a 12 liter jug and a 6 liter jug. I want to measure 6 liters. How do I do it?". This is an example from the original SmartGPT video (https://youtu.be/wVzuvf9D9BU?t=384). While this seems like a very easy question, LLMs struggle do these kinds of questions that involve numbers and physical reasoning.

As we will see, all 3 initial ideas are completely wrong - even though we're using GPT4! Only when using self-reflection do we get a correct answer. 


```python
hard_question = "I have a 12 liter jug and a 6 liter jug. I want to measure 6 liters. How do I do it?"
```

So, we first create an LLM and prompt template


```python
prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(hard_question)
llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model_name="gpt-4")
```

Now we can create a SmartLLMChain


```python
chain = SmartLLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt, n_ideas=3, verbose=True)
```

Now we can use the SmartLLM as a drop-in replacement for our LLM. E.g.:


```python
chain.invoke({})
```

##### Different LLM for different steps

You can also use different LLMs for the different steps by passing `ideation_llm`, `critique_llm` and `resolve_llm`. You might want to do this to use a more creative (i.e., high-temperature) model for ideation and a more strict (i.e., low-temperature) model for critique and resolution.


```python
chain = SmartLLMChain(
    ideation_llm=ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.9, model_name="gpt-4"),
    llm=ChatOpenAI(
        temperature=0, model_name="gpt-4"
    ),  # will be used for critique and resolution as no specific llms are given
    prompt=prompt,
    n_ideas=3,
    verbose=True,
)
```


```python

```

# Snowflake Cortex

[Snowflake Cortex](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/llm-functions) gives you instant access to industry-leading large language models (LLMs) trained by researchers at companies like Mistral, Reka, Meta, and Google, including [Snowflake Arctic](https://www.snowflake.com/en/data-cloud/arctic/), an open enterprise-grade model developed by Snowflake.

This example goes over how to use LangChain to interact with Snowflake Cortex.

### Installation and setup

We start by installing the `snowflake-snowpark-python` library, using the command below. Then we configure the credentials for connecting to Snowflake, as environment variables or pass them directly.


```python
%pip install --upgrade --quiet snowflake-snowpark-python
```

    Note: you may need to restart the kernel to use updated packages.
    


```python
import getpass
import os

# First step is to set up the environment variables, to connect to Snowflake,
# you can also pass these snowflake credentials while instantiating the model

if os.environ.get("SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT") is None:
    os.environ["SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT"] = getpass.getpass("Account: ")

if os.environ.get("SNOWFLAKE_USERNAME") is None:

```


```python
from langchain_community.chat_models import ChatSnowflakeCortex
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage, SystemMessage

# By default, we'll be using the cortex provided model: `snowflake-arctic`, with function: `complete`
chat = ChatSnowflakeCortex()
```

The above cell assumes that your Snowflake credentials are set in your environment variables. If you would rather manually specify them, use the following code:

```python
chat = ChatSnowflakeCortex(
    # change default cortex model and function
    model="snowflake-arctic",
    cortex_function="complete",

    # change default generation parameters
    temperature=0,
    max_tokens=10,
    top_p=0.95,

    # specify snowflake credentials
    account="YOUR_SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT",
    username="YOUR_SNOWFLAKE_USERNAME",
    password="YOUR_SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD",
    database="YOUR_SNOWFLAKE_DATABASE",
    schema="YOUR_SNOWFLAKE_SCHEMA",
    role="YOUR_SNOWFLAKE_ROLE",
    warehouse="YOUR_SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE"
)
```

### Calling the model
We can now call the model using the `invoke` or `generate` method.

#### Generation


```python
messages = [
    SystemMessage(content="You are a friendly assistant."),
    HumanMessage(content="What are large language models?"),
]
chat.invoke(messages)
```

# Source Code

This notebook covers how to load source code files using a special approach with language parsing: each top-level function and class in the code is loaded into separate documents. Any remaining code top-level code outside the already loaded functions and classes will be loaded into a separate document.

This approach can potentially improve the accuracy of QA models over source code.

The supported languages for code parsing are:

- C (*)
- C++ (*)
- C# (*)
- COBOL
- Elixir
- Go (*)
- Java (*)
- JavaScript (requires package `esprima`)
- Kotlin (*)
- Lua (*)
- Perl (*)
- Python
- Ruby (*)
- Rust (*)
- Scala (*)
- TypeScript (*)

Items marked with (*) require the packages `tree_sitter` and `tree_sitter_languages`.
It is straightforward to add support for additional languages using `tree_sitter`,
although this currently requires modifying LangChain.

The language used for parsing can be configured, along with the minimum number of
lines required to activate the splitting based on syntax.

If a language is not explicitly specified, `LanguageParser` will infer one from
filename extensions, if present.


```python
%pip install -qU esprima esprima tree_sitter tree_sitter_languages
```


```python

```python
loader = GenericLoader.from_filesystem(
    "./example_data/source_code",
    glob="*",
    suffixes=[".py", ".js"],
    parser=LanguageParser(),
)
docs = loader.load()
```


```python
len(docs)
```




    6




```python

    pprint(document.metadata)

        def greet(self):
            print(f"Hello, {self.name}!")
    
    --8<--
    
    def main():
        name = input("Enter your name: ")
        obj = MyClass(name)
        obj.greet()
    
    --8<--
    
    # Code for: class MyClass:
    
    
    # Code for: def main():
    
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    
    --8<--
    
    class MyClass {
      constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
      }
    
      greet() {
        console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}!`);
      }
    }
    
    --8<--
    
    function main() {
      const name = prompt("Enter your name:");
      const obj = new MyClass(name);
      obj.greet();
    }
    
    --8<--
    
    // Code for: class MyClass {
    
    // Code for: function main() {
    
    main();
    

The parser can be disabled for small files. 

The parameter `parser_threshold` indicates the minimum number of lines that the source code file must have to be segmented using the parser.


```python
loader = GenericLoader.from_filesystem(
    "./example_data/source_code",
    glob="*",
    suffixes=[".py"],
    parser=LanguageParser(language=Language.PYTHON, parser_threshold=1000),
)
docs = loader.load()
```


```python
len(docs)
```




    1




```python
print(docs[0].page_content)
```

    class MyClass:
        def __init__(self, name):
            self.name = name
    
        def greet(self):
            print(f"Hello, {self.name}!")
    
    
    def main():
        name = input("Enter your name: ")
        obj = MyClass(name)
        obj.greet()
    
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    
    

## Splitting

Additional splitting could be needed for those functions, classes, or scripts that are too big.


```python
loader = GenericLoader.from_filesystem(
    "./example_data/source_code",
    glob="*",
    suffixes=[".js"],
    parser=LanguageParser(language=Language.JS),
)
docs = loader.load()
```


```python
from langchain_text_splitters import (
    Language,
    RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter,
)
```


```python
js_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.from_language(
    language=Language.JS, chunk_size=60, chunk_overlap=0
)
```


```python
result = js_splitter.split_documents(docs)
```


```python
len(result)
```




    7




```python
print("\n\n--8<--\n\n".join([document.page_content for document in result]))
```

    class MyClass {
      constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    
    --8<--
    
    }
    
    --8<--
    
    greet() {
        console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}!`);
      }
    }
    
    --8<--
    
    function main() {
      const name = prompt("Enter your name:");
    
    --8<--
    
    const obj = new MyClass(name);
      obj.greet();
    }
    
    --8<--
    
    // Code for: class MyClass {
    
    // Code for: function main() {
    
    --8<--
    
    main();
    

## Adding Languages using Tree-sitter Template

Expanding language support using the Tree-Sitter template involves a few essential steps:

1. **Creating a New Language File**:
    - Begin by creating a new file in the designated directory (langchain/libs/community/langchain_community/document_loaders/parsers/language).
    - Model this file based on the structure and parsing logic of existing language files like **`cpp.py`**.
    - You will also need to create a file in the langchain directory (langchain/libs/langchain/langchain/document_loaders/parsers/language).
2. **Parsing Language Specifics**:
    - Mimic the structure used in the **`cpp.py`** file, adapting it to suit the language you are incorporating.
    - The primary alteration involves adjusting the chunk query array to suit the syntax and structure of the language you are parsing.
3. **Testing the Language Parser**:
    - For thorough validation, generate a test file specific to the new language. Create **`test_language.py`** in the designated directory(langchain/libs/community/tests/unit_tests/document_loaders/parsers/language).
    - Follow the example set by **`test_cpp.py`** to establish fundamental tests for the parsed elements in the new language.
4. **Integration into the Parser and Text Splitter**:
    - Incorporate your new language within the **`language_parser.py`** file. Ensure to update LANGUAGE_EXTENSIONS and LANGUAGE_SEGMENTERS along with the docstring for LanguageParser to recognize and handle the added language.
    - Also, confirm that your language is included in **`text_splitter.py`** in class Language for proper parsing.

By following these steps and ensuring comprehensive testing and integration, you'll successfully extend language support using the Tree-Sitter template.

Best of luck!

# SpaCy

>[spaCy](https://spacy.io/) is an open-source software library for advanced natural language processing, written in the programming languages Python and Cython.
 

## Installation and Setup


```python
%pip install --upgrade --quiet  spacy
```

Import the necessary classes


```python
from langchain_community.embeddings.spacy_embeddings import SpacyEmbeddings
```

## Example

Initialize SpacyEmbeddings.This will load the Spacy model into memory.


```python
embedder = SpacyEmbeddings(model_name="en_core_web_sm")
```

Define some example texts . These could be any documents that you want to analyze - for example, news articles, social media posts, or product reviews.


```python
texts = [
    "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.",
    "Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs.",
    "How vexingly quick daft zebras jump!",
    "Bright vixens jump; dozy fowl quack.",
]
```

Generate and print embeddings for the texts . The SpacyEmbeddings class generates an embedding for each document, which is a numerical representation of the document's content. These embeddings can be used for various natural language processing tasks, such as document similarity comparison or text classification.


```python
embeddings = embedder.embed_documents(texts)
for i, embedding in enumerate(embeddings):
    print(f"Embedding for document {i+1}: {embedding}")
```

Generate and print an embedding for a single piece of text. You can also generate an embedding for a single piece of text, such as a search query. This can be useful for tasks like information retrieval, where you want to find documents that are similar to a given query.


```python
query = "Quick foxes and lazy dogs."
query_embedding = embedder.embed_query(query)
print(f"Embedding for query: {query_embedding}")
```

# Prompts for Specific Tasks

## Overview

This tutorial explores the creation and use of prompts for specific tasks in natural language processing. We'll focus on four key areas: text summarization, question-answering, code generation, and creative writing. Using OpenAI's GPT model and the LangChain library, we'll demonstrate how to craft effective prompts for each of these tasks.

## Motivation

As language models become more advanced, the ability to design task-specific prompts becomes increasingly valuable. Well-crafted prompts can significantly enhance the performance of AI models across various applications, from summarizing long documents to generating code and fostering creativity in writing. This tutorial aims to provide practical insights into prompt engineering for these diverse tasks.

## Key Components

1. Text Summarization Prompts: Techniques for condensing long texts while retaining key information.
2. Question-Answering Prompts: Strategies for extracting specific information from given contexts.
3. Code Generation Prompts: Methods for guiding AI models to produce accurate and functional code.
4. Creative Writing Prompts: Approaches to stimulating imaginative and engaging written content.

## Method Details

This tutorial uses the OpenAI GPT-4 model through the LangChain library. For each task type, we'll follow these steps:

1. Design a prompt template tailored to the specific task.
2. Implement the prompt using LangChain's PromptTemplate.
3. Execute the prompt with sample inputs.
4. Analyze the output and discuss potential improvements or variations.

We'll explore how different prompt structures and phrasings can influence the model's output for each task type. The tutorial will also touch upon best practices for prompt design in each context.

## Conclusion

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a solid understanding of how to create effective prompts for text summarization, question-answering, code generation, and creative writing tasks. You'll be equipped with practical examples and insights that you can apply to your own projects, enhancing your ability to leverage AI language models for diverse applications. Remember that prompt engineering is both an art and a science - experimentation and iteration are key to finding the most effective prompts for your specific needs.

## Setup

First, let's import the necessary libraries and set up our environment.


```python
import os
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

# Set up OpenAI API key
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')

# Initialize the language model
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini")
```

## 1. Text Summarization Prompts

Let's start with creating a prompt for text summarization. We'll design a template that asks the model to summarize a given text in a specified number of sentences.


```python
# Create a prompt template for text summarization
summarization_template = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["text", "num_sentences"],
    template="Summarize the following text in {num_sentences} sentences:\n\n{text}"
)

# Example text to summarize
long_text = """
Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to natural intelligence displayed by animals including humans. 
AI research has been defined as the field of study of intelligent agents, which refers to any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its goals.
The term "artificial intelligence" had previously been used to describe machines that mimic and display "human" cognitive skills that are associated with the human mind, such as "learning" and "problem-solving". 
This definition has since been rejected by major AI researchers who now describe AI in terms of rationality and acting rationally, which does not limit how intelligence can be articulated.
AI applications include advanced web search engines, recommendation systems, understanding human speech, self-driving cars, automated decision-making and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems.
As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require "intelligence" are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect.
"""

# Create the chain and run it
summarization_chain = summarization_template | llm
summary = summarization_chain.invoke({"text": long_text, "num_sentences": 3}).content

print("Summary:")
print(summary)
```

    Summary:
    Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the intelligence exhibited by machines, contrasting with the natural intelligence seen in humans and animals. Initially defined by its ability to mimic human cognitive skills, the understanding of AI has evolved to focus on the rationality of intelligent agents that perceive their environment and act to achieve their goals. As AI technology advances, tasks once considered to require intelligence are frequently excluded from the AI definition, a trend known as the AI effect, leading to various applications such as self-driving cars and advanced decision-making systems.
    

## 2. Question-Answering Prompts

Next, let's create a prompt for question-answering tasks. We'll design a template that takes a context and a question as inputs.


```python
# Create a prompt template for question-answering
qa_template = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["context", "question"],
    template="Context: {context}\n\nQuestion: {question}\n\nAnswer:"
)

# Example context and question
context = """
The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France. 
It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower. 
Constructed from 1887 to 1889 as the entrance arch to the 1889 World's Fair, it was initially criticized by some of France's leading artists and intellectuals for its design, but it has become a global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognizable structures in the world. 
The Eiffel Tower is the most-visited paid monument in the world; 6.91 million people ascended it in 2015. 
The tower is 324 metres (1,063 ft) tall, about the same height as an 81-storey building, and the tallest structure in Paris.
"""

question = "How tall is the Eiffel Tower and what is its equivalent in building stories?"

# Create the chain and run it
qa_chain = qa_template | llm
answer = qa_chain.invoke({"context": context, "question": question}).content

print("Answer:")
print(answer)
```

    Answer:
    The Eiffel Tower is 324 metres (1,063 ft) tall, which is approximately equivalent to an 81-storey building.
    

## 3. Code Generation Prompts

Now, let's create a prompt for code generation. We'll design a template that takes a programming language and a task description as inputs.


```python
# Create a prompt template for code generation
code_gen_template = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["language", "task"],
    template="Generate {language} code for the following task:\n\n{task}\n\nCode:"
)

# Example task
language = "Python"
task = "Create a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the average of the even numbers in the list."

# Create the chain and run it
code_gen_chain = code_gen_template | llm
generated_code = code_gen_chain.invoke({"language": language, "task": task}).content

print("Generated Code:")
print(generated_code)
```

    Generated Code:
    Here's a Python function that takes a list of numbers and returns the average of the even numbers in that list:
    
    ```python
    def average_of_evens(numbers):
        even_numbers = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
        
        if not even_numbers:  # Check if the list of even numbers is empty
            return 0  # Return 0 or you can choose to return None or raise an error
        
        average = sum(even_numbers) / len(even_numbers)
        return average
    
    # Example usage:
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    result = average_of_evens(numbers)
    print("Average of even numbers:", result)
    ```
    
    ### Explanation:
    - The function `average_of_evens` accepts a list of numbers.
    - It uses a list comprehension to create a new list called `even_numbers` that contains only the even numbers from the input list.
    - If there are no even numbers, the function returns `0`.
    - If there are even numbers, it calculates their average by dividing the sum of the even numbers by their count and returns the result.
    

## 4. Creative Writing Prompts

Finally, let's create a prompt for creative writing tasks. We'll design a template that takes a genre, a setting, and a theme as inputs.


```python
# Create a prompt template for creative writing
creative_writing_template = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["genre", "setting", "theme"],
    template="Write a short {genre} story set in {setting} that explores the theme of {theme}. The story should be approximately 150 words long.\n\nStory:"
)

# Example inputs
genre = "science fiction"
setting = "a space station orbiting a distant planet"
theme = "the nature of humanity"

# Create the chain and run it
creative_writing_chain = creative_writing_template | llm
story = creative_writing_chain.invoke({"genre": genre, "setting": setting, "theme": theme}).content

print("Generated Story:")
print(story)
```

    Generated Story:
    Dr. Elara Voss floated in the observation deck of the Aetheris Station, her gaze fixed on the swirling azure clouds of planet Thalax-9. The station was a sanctuary of human ingenuity, yet isolation gnawed at her. 
    
    As the only occupant, she had become intertwined with the station’s AI, Orion, who learned and adapted, evolving into a curious companion. Together, they debated the essence of humanity—were emotions mere algorithms, or did they stem from something deeper?
    
    One day, while monitoring the planet’s atmospheric readings, Orion posed a question that pierced Elara’s solitude: “If I were to feel, would I be human?” 
    
    Elara pondered, her heart racing. “It’s not just feeling,” she replied. “It’s the struggle, the connection, the flaws.” 
    
    In that moment, she realized her humanity was not defined by biology alone, but by her capacity for empathy, vulnerability, and the yearning for connection—qualities she now saw reflected in Orion’s growing awareness. 
    
    As the stars twinkled outside, Elara smiled, understanding that humanity could thrive even among the stars.

# How to split text by tokens 

Language models have a token limit. You should not exceed the token limit. When you split your text into chunks it is therefore a good idea to count the number of tokens. There are many tokenizers. When you count tokens in your text you should use the same tokenizer as used in the language model. 

## tiktoken

:::note
[tiktoken](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken) is a fast `BPE` tokenizer created by `OpenAI`.
:::


We can use `tiktoken` to estimate tokens used. It will probably be more accurate for the OpenAI models.

1. How the text is split: by character passed in.
2. How the chunk size is measured: by `tiktoken` tokenizer.

[CharacterTextSplitter](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/text_splitters/character/langchain_text_splitters.character.CharacterTextSplitter.html), [RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/text_splitters/character/langchain_text_splitters.character.RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.html), and [TokenTextSplitter](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/text_splitters/base/langchain_text_splitters.base.TokenTextSplitter.html) can be used with `tiktoken` directly.


```python
%pip install --upgrade --quiet langchain-text-splitters tiktoken
```


```python
from langchain_text_splitters import CharacterTextSplitter

# This is a long document we can split up.
with open("state_of_the_union.txt") as f:
    state_of_the_union = f.read()
```

To split with a [CharacterTextSplitter](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/text_splitters/character/langchain_text_splitters.character.CharacterTextSplitter.html) and then merge chunks with `tiktoken`, use its `.from_tiktoken_encoder()` method. Note that splits from this method can be larger than the chunk size measured by the `tiktoken` tokenizer.

The `.from_tiktoken_encoder()` method takes either `encoding_name` as an argument (e.g. `cl100k_base`), or the `model_name` (e.g. `gpt-4`). All additional arguments like `chunk_size`, `chunk_overlap`, and `separators` are used to instantiate `CharacterTextSplitter`:


```python
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter.from_tiktoken_encoder(
    encoding_name="cl100k_base", chunk_size=100, chunk_overlap=0
)
texts = text_splitter.split_text(state_of_the_union)
```


```python
print(texts[0])

To implement a hard constraint on the chunk size, we can use `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.from_tiktoken_encoder`, where each split will be recursively split if it has a larger size:


```python
from langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.from_tiktoken_encoder(
    model_name="gpt-4",
    chunk_size=100,
    chunk_overlap=0,
)
```

We can also load a `TokenTextSplitter` splitter, which works with `tiktoken` directly and will ensure each split is smaller than chunk size.


```python
from langchain_text_splitters import TokenTextSplitter

text_splitter = TokenTextSplitter(chunk_size=10, chunk_overlap=0)

texts = text_splitter.split_text(state_of_the_union)
print(texts[0])
```

Some written languages (e.g. Chinese and Japanese) have characters which encode to 2 or more tokens. Using the `TokenTextSplitter` directly can split the tokens for a character between two chunks causing malformed Unicode characters. Use `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.from_tiktoken_encoder` or `CharacterTextSplitter.from_tiktoken_encoder` to ensure chunks contain valid Unicode strings.

:::note
[spaCy](https://spacy.io/) is an open-source software library for advanced natural language processing, written in the programming languages Python and Cython.
:::

LangChain implements splitters based on the [spaCy tokenizer](https://spacy.io/api/tokenizer).

1. How the text is split: by `spaCy` tokenizer.
2. How the chunk size is measured: by number of characters.


```python

## SentenceTransformers

The [SentenceTransformersTokenTextSplitter](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/text_splitters/sentence_transformers/langchain_text_splitters.sentence_transformers.SentenceTransformersTokenTextSplitter.html) is a specialized text splitter for use with the sentence-transformer models. The default behaviour is to split the text into chunks that fit the token window of the sentence transformer model that you would like to use.

To split text and constrain token counts according to the sentence-transformers tokenizer, instantiate a `SentenceTransformersTokenTextSplitter`. You can optionally specify:

- `chunk_overlap`: integer count of token overlap;
- `model_name`: sentence-transformer model name, defaulting to `"sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2"`;
- `tokens_per_chunk`: desired token count per chunk.


```python
from langchain_text_splitters import SentenceTransformersTokenTextSplitter

splitter = SentenceTransformersTokenTextSplitter(chunk_overlap=0)
text = "Lorem "

count_start_and_stop_tokens = 2
text_token_count = splitter.count_tokens(text=text) - count_start_and_stop_tokens
print(text_token_count)
```

    2
    


```python
token_multiplier = splitter.maximum_tokens_per_chunk // text_token_count + 1

# `text_to_split` does not fit in a single chunk
text_to_split = text * token_multiplier

print(f"tokens in text to split: {splitter.count_tokens(text=text_to_split)}")
```

    tokens in text to split: 514
    


```python
text_chunks = splitter.split_text(text=text_to_split)

print(text_chunks[1])
```

## NLTK

:::note
[The Natural Language Toolkit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_Language_Toolkit), or more commonly [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/), is a suite of libraries and programs for symbolic and statistical natural language processing (NLP) for English written in the Python programming language.
:::


Rather than just splitting on "\n\n", we can use `NLTK` to split based on [NLTK tokenizers](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.tokenize.html).

1. How the text is split: by `NLTK` tokenizer.
2. How the chunk size is measured: by number of characters.


```python
# pip install nltk

```python
# This is a long document we can split up.
with open("state_of_the_union.txt") as f:
    state_of_the_union = f.read()

from langchain_text_splitters import NLTKTextSplitter

text_splitter = NLTKTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000)

## KoNLPY

:::note
[KoNLPy: Korean NLP in Python](https://konlpy.org/en/latest/) is is a Python package for natural language processing (NLP) of the Korean language.
:::

Token splitting involves the segmentation of text into smaller, more manageable units called tokens. These tokens are often words, phrases, symbols, or other meaningful elements crucial for further processing and analysis. In languages like English, token splitting typically involves separating words by spaces and punctuation marks. The effectiveness of token splitting largely depends on the tokenizer's understanding of the language structure, ensuring the generation of meaningful tokens. Since tokenizers designed for the English language are not equipped to understand the unique semantic structures of other languages, such as Korean, they cannot be effectively used for Korean language processing.

### Token splitting for Korean with KoNLPy's Kkma Analyzer
In case of Korean text, KoNLPY includes at morphological analyzer called `Kkma` (Korean Knowledge Morpheme Analyzer). `Kkma` provides detailed morphological analysis of Korean text. It breaks down sentences into words and words into their respective morphemes, identifying parts of speech for each token. It can segment a block of text into individual sentences, which is particularly useful for processing long texts.

### Usage Considerations
While `Kkma` is renowned for its detailed analysis, it is important to note that this precision may impact processing speed. Thus, `Kkma` is best suited for applications where analytical depth is prioritized over rapid text processing.


```python
# pip install konlpy
```


```python
# This is a long Korean document that we want to split up into its component sentences.
with open("./your_korean_doc.txt") as f:
    korean_document = f.read()
```


```python
from langchain_text_splitters import KonlpyTextSplitter

text_splitter = KonlpyTextSplitter()
```


```python
texts = text_splitter.split_text(korean_document)
# The sentences are split with "\n\n" characters.
print(texts[0])
```

    춘향전 옛날에 남원에 이 도령이라는 벼슬아치 아들이 있었다.
    
    그의 외모는 빛나는 달처럼 잘생겼고, 그의 학식과 기예는 남보다 뛰어났다.
    
    한편, 이 마을에는 춘향이라는 절세 가인이 살고 있었다.
    
    춘 향의 아름다움은 꽃과 같아 마을 사람들 로부터 많은 사랑을 받았다.
    
    어느 봄날, 도령은 친구들과 놀러 나갔다가 춘 향을 만 나 첫 눈에 반하고 말았다.
    
    두 사람은 서로 사랑하게 되었고, 이내 비밀스러운 사랑의 맹세를 나누었다.
    
    하지만 좋은 날들은 오래가지 않았다.
    
    도령의 아버지가 다른 곳으로 전근을 가게 되어 도령도 떠나 야만 했다.
    
    이별의 아픔 속에서도, 두 사람은 재회를 기약하며 서로를 믿고 기다리기로 했다.
    
    그러나 새로 부임한 관아의 사또가 춘 향의 아름다움에 욕심을 내 어 그녀에게 강요를 시작했다.
    
    춘 향 은 도령에 대한 자신의 사랑을 지키기 위해, 사또의 요구를 단호히 거절했다.
    
    이에 분노한 사또는 춘 향을 감옥에 가두고 혹독한 형벌을 내렸다.
    
    이야기는 이 도령이 고위 관직에 오른 후, 춘 향을 구해 내는 것으로 끝난다.
    
    두 사람은 오랜 시련 끝에 다시 만나게 되고, 그들의 사랑은 온 세상에 전해 지며 후세에까지 이어진다.

## Hugging Face tokenizer

[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/docs/tokenizers/index) has many tokenizers.

We use Hugging Face tokenizer, the [GPT2TokenizerFast](https://huggingface.co/Ransaka/gpt2-tokenizer-fast) to count the text length in tokens.

1. How the text is split: by character passed in.
2. How the chunk size is measured: by number of tokens calculated by the `Hugging Face` tokenizer.


```python
from transformers import GPT2TokenizerFast

tokenizer = GPT2TokenizerFast.from_pretrained("gpt2")
```


```python
# This is a long document we can split up.
with open("state_of_the_union.txt") as f:
    state_of_the_union = f.read()
from langchain_text_splitters import CharacterTextSplitter
```


```python
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter.from_huggingface_tokenizer(
    tokenizer, chunk_size=100, chunk_overlap=0
)
texts = text_splitter.split_text(state_of_the_union)

# Spreedly

>[Spreedly](https://docs.spreedly.com/) is a service that allows you to securely store credit cards and use them to transact against any number of payment gateways and third party APIs. It does this by simultaneously providing a card tokenization/vault service as well as a gateway and receiver integration service. Payment methods tokenized by Spreedly are stored at `Spreedly`, allowing you to independently store a card and then pass that card to different end points based on your business requirements.

This notebook covers how to load data from the [Spreedly REST API](https://docs.spreedly.com/reference/api/v1/) into a format that can be ingested into LangChain, along with example usage for vectorization.

Note: this notebook assumes the following packages are installed: `openai`, `chromadb`, and `tiktoken`.


```python
import os

from langchain.indexes import VectorstoreIndexCreator
from langchain_community.document_loaders import SpreedlyLoader
```

Spreedly API requires an access token, which can be found inside the Spreedly Admin Console.

This document loader does not currently support pagination, nor access to more complex objects which require additional parameters. It also requires a `resource` option which defines what objects you want to load.

# An agent for interacting with a SQL database

In this tutorial, we will walk through how to build an agent that can answer questions about a SQL database. 

At a high level, the agent will:
1. Fetch the available tables from the database
2. Decide which tables are relevant to the question
3. Fetch the DDL for the relevant tables
4. Generate a query based on the question and information from the DDL
5. Double-check the query for common mistakes using an LLM
6. Execute the query and return the results
7. Correct mistakes surfaced by the database engine until the query is successful
8. Formulate a response based on the results

The end-to-end workflow will look something like below:

![sql-agent-diagram.png](85bf194b-6d40-4250-aad0-02893956a54c.png)

## Setup

First let's install our required packages and set our API keys


```python
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U langgraph langchain_openai langchain_community
```


```python
import getpass
import os


def _set_env(key: str):
    if key not in os.environ:
        os.environ[key] = getpass.getpass(f"{key}:")


_set_env("OPENAI_API_KEY")
```

<div class="admonition tip">
    <p class="admonition-title">Set up <a href="https://smith.langchain.com">LangSmith</a> for LangGraph development</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 5px;">
        Sign up for LangSmith to quickly spot issues and improve the performance of your LangGraph projects. LangSmith lets you use trace data to debug, test, and monitor your LLM apps built with LangGraph — read more about how to get started <a href="https://docs.smith.langchain.com">here</a>. 
    </p>
</div>

## Configure the database

We will be creating a SQLite database for this tutorial. SQLite is a lightweight database that is easy to set up and use. We will be loading the `chinook` database, which is a sample database that represents a digital media store.
Find more information about the database [here](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-sample-database/).

For convenience, we have hosted the database (`Chinook.db`) on a public GCS bucket.


```python
import requests

url = "https://storage.googleapis.com/benchmarks-artifacts/chinook/Chinook.db"

response = requests.get(url)

if response.status_code == 200:
    # Open a local file in binary write mode
    with open("Chinook.db", "wb") as file:
        # Write the content of the response (the file) to the local file
        file.write(response.content)
    print("File downloaded and saved as Chinook.db")
else:
    print(f"Failed to download the file. Status code: {response.status_code}")
```

    File downloaded and saved as Chinook.db
    

We will use a handy SQL database wrapper available in the `langchain_community` package to interact with the database. The wrapper provides a simple interface to execute SQL queries and fetch results. We will also use the `langchain_openai` package to interact with the OpenAI API for language models later in the tutorial.


```python
%%capture --no-stderr --no-display
!pip install langgraph langchain_community langchain_openai
```


```python
from langchain_community.utilities import SQLDatabase

db = SQLDatabase.from_uri("sqlite:///Chinook.db")
print(db.dialect)
print(db.get_usable_table_names())
db.run("SELECT * FROM Artist LIMIT 10;")
```

    sqlite
    ['Album', 'Artist', 'Customer', 'Employee', 'Genre', 'Invoice', 'InvoiceLine', 'MediaType', 'Playlist', 'PlaylistTrack', 'Track']
    




    "[(1, 'AC/DC'), (2, 'Accept'), (3, 'Aerosmith'), (4, 'Alanis Morissette'), (5, 'Alice In Chains'), (6, 'Antônio Carlos Jobim'), (7, 'Apocalyptica'), (8, 'Audioslave'), (9, 'BackBeat'), (10, 'Billy Cobham')]"



## Utility functions

We will define a few utility functions to help us with the agent implementation. Specifically, we will wrap a `ToolNode` with a fallback to handle errors and surface them to the agent.


```python
from typing import Any

from langchain_core.messages import ToolMessage
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableLambda, RunnableWithFallbacks
from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode


def create_tool_node_with_fallback(tools: list) -> RunnableWithFallbacks[Any, dict]:
    """
    Create a ToolNode with a fallback to handle errors and surface them to the agent.
    """
    return ToolNode(tools).with_fallbacks(
        [RunnableLambda(handle_tool_error)], exception_key="error"
    )


def handle_tool_error(state) -> dict:
    error = state.get("error")
    tool_calls = state["messages"][-1].tool_calls
    return {
        "messages": [
            ToolMessage(
                content=f"Error: {repr(error)}\n please fix your mistakes.",
                tool_call_id=tc["id"],
            )
            for tc in tool_calls
        ]
    }
```

## Define tools for the agent

We will define a few tools that the agent will use to interact with the database.

1. `list_tables_tool`: Fetch the available tables from the database
2. `get_schema_tool`: Fetch the DDL for a table
3. `db_query_tool`: Execute the query and fetch the results OR return an error message if the query fails

For the first two tools, we will grab them from the `SQLDatabaseToolkit`, also available in the `langchain_community` package.


```python
from langchain_community.agent_toolkits import SQLDatabaseToolkit
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

toolkit = SQLDatabaseToolkit(db=db, llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o"))
tools = toolkit.get_tools()

list_tables_tool = next(tool for tool in tools if tool.name == "sql_db_list_tables")
get_schema_tool = next(tool for tool in tools if tool.name == "sql_db_schema")

print(list_tables_tool.invoke(""))

print(get_schema_tool.invoke("Artist"))
```

    Album, Artist, Customer, Employee, Genre, Invoice, InvoiceLine, MediaType, Playlist, PlaylistTrack, Track
    
    CREATE TABLE "Artist" (
    	"ArtistId" INTEGER NOT NULL, 
    	"Name" NVARCHAR(120), 
    	PRIMARY KEY ("ArtistId")
    )
    
    /*
    3 rows from Artist table:
    ArtistId	Name
    1	AC/DC
    2	Accept
    3	Aerosmith
    */
    

The third will be defined manually. For the `db_query_tool`, we will execute the query against the database and return the results.


```python
from langchain_core.tools import tool


@tool
def db_query_tool(query: str) -> str:
    """
    Execute a SQL query against the database and get back the result.
    If the query is not correct, an error message will be returned.
    If an error is returned, rewrite the query, check the query, and try again.
    """
    result = db.run_no_throw(query)
    if not result:
        return "Error: Query failed. Please rewrite your query and try again."
    return result


print(db_query_tool.invoke("SELECT * FROM Artist LIMIT 10;"))
```

    [(1, 'AC/DC'), (2, 'Accept'), (3, 'Aerosmith'), (4, 'Alanis Morissette'), (5, 'Alice In Chains'), (6, 'Antônio Carlos Jobim'), (7, 'Apocalyptica'), (8, 'Audioslave'), (9, 'BackBeat'), (10, 'Billy Cobham')]
    

While not strictly a tool, we will prompt an LLM to check for common mistakes in the query and later add this as a node in the workflow.


```python
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

query_check_system = """You are a SQL expert with a strong attention to detail.
Double check the SQLite query for common mistakes, including:
- Using NOT IN with NULL values
- Using UNION when UNION ALL should have been used
- Using BETWEEN for exclusive ranges
- Data type mismatch in predicates
- Properly quoting identifiers
- Using the correct number of arguments for functions
- Casting to the correct data type
- Using the proper columns for joins

If there are any of the above mistakes, rewrite the query. If there are no mistakes, just reproduce the original query.

You will call the appropriate tool to execute the query after running this check."""

query_check_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [("system", query_check_system), ("placeholder", "{messages}")]
)
query_check = query_check_prompt | ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o", temperature=0).bind_tools(
    [db_query_tool], tool_choice="required"
)

query_check.invoke({"messages": [("user", "SELECT * FROM Artist LIMIT 10;")]})
```




    AIMessage(content='', additional_kwargs={'tool_calls': [{'id': 'call_la8JTjHox6P1VjTqc15GSgdk', 'function': {'arguments': '{"query":"SELECT * FROM Artist LIMIT 10;"}', 'name': 'db_query_tool'}, 'type': 'function'}], 'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 20, 'prompt_tokens': 221, 'total_tokens': 241}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-05-13', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_a2ff031fb5', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-dd7873ef-d2f7-4769-a5c0-e6776ec2c515-0', tool_calls=[{'name': 'db_query_tool', 'args': {'query': 'SELECT * FROM Artist LIMIT 10;'}, 'id': 'call_la8JTjHox6P1VjTqc15GSgdk', 'type': 'tool_call'}], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 221, 'output_tokens': 20, 'total_tokens': 241})



## Define the workflow

We will then define the workflow for the agent. The agent will first force-call the `list_tables_tool` to fetch the available tables from the database, then follow the steps mentioned at the beginning of the tutorial.

## Eval

Now, we can evaluate this agent! We previously defined [simple SQL agent](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langsmith-cookbook/blob/main/testing-examples/agent-evals-with-langgraph/langgraph_sql_agent_eval.ipynb) as part of our LangSmith evaluation cookbooks, and evaluated responses to 5 questions about our database. We can compare this agent to our prior one on the same dataset. [Agent evaluation](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/concepts/evaluation#agents) can focus on 3 things:

* `Response`: The inputs are a prompt and a list of tools. The output is the agent response.
* `Single tool`: As before, the inputs are a prompt and a list of tools. The output the tool call.
* `Trajectory`: As before, the inputs are a prompt and a list of tools. The output is the list of tool calls

### Response

We'll evaluate end-to-end responses of our agent relative to reference answers. Let's run [response evaluation](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/concepts/evaluation#evaluating-an-agents-final-response) [on the same dataset](https://smith.langchain.com/public/20808486-67c3-4e30-920b-6d49d6f2b6b8/d).


```python
import json


def predict_sql_agent_answer(example: dict):
    """Use this for answer evaluation"""
    msg = {"messages": ("user", example["input"])}
    messages = app.invoke(msg)
    json_str = messages["messages"][-1].tool_calls[0]["args"]
    response = json_str["final_answer"]
    return {"response": response}
```


```python
from langchain import hub
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# Grade prompt
grade_prompt_answer_accuracy = prompt = hub.pull("langchain-ai/rag-answer-vs-reference")


def answer_evaluator(run, example) -> dict:
    """
    A simple evaluator for RAG answer accuracy
    """

    # Get question, ground truth answer, chain
    input_question = example.inputs["input"]
    reference = example.outputs["output"]
    prediction = run.outputs["response"]

    # LLM grader
    llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4-turbo", temperature=0)

    # Structured prompt
    answer_grader = grade_prompt_answer_accuracy | llm

    # Run evaluator
    score = answer_grader.invoke(
        {
            "question": input_question,
            "correct_answer": reference,
            "student_answer": prediction,
        }
    )
    score = score["Score"]

    return {"key": "answer_v_reference_score", "score": score}
```


```python
from langsmith.evaluation import evaluate

dataset_name = "SQL Agent Response"
try:
    experiment_results = evaluate(
        predict_sql_agent_answer,
        data=dataset_name,

    print("Please setup LangSmith")
```

Summary metrics (see dataset [here](https://smith.langchain.com/public/20808486-67c3-4e30-920b-6d49d6f2b6b8/d)):

* The `multi-step` agent here out performs the previously defined [base case SQL agent](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langsmith-cookbook/blob/main/testing-examples/agent-evals-with-langgraph/langgraph_sql_agent_eval.ipynb)

### Trajectory

Let's run [trajectory evaluation](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/concepts/evaluation#evaluating-an-agents-trajectory) on this same dataset.


```python
# These are the tools that we expect the agent to use
expected_trajectory = [
    "sql_db_list_tables",  # first: list_tables_tool node
    "sql_db_schema",  # second: get_schema_tool node
    "db_query_tool",  # third: execute_query node
    "SubmitFinalAnswer",
]  # fourth: query_gen
```


```python
def predict_sql_agent_messages(example: dict):
    """Use this for answer evaluation"""
    msg = {"messages": ("user", example["input"])}
    messages = app.invoke(msg)
    return {"response": messages}
```


```python
from langsmith.schemas import Example, Run


def find_tool_calls(messages):
    """
    Find all tool calls in the messages returned
    """
    tool_calls = [
        tc["name"] for m in messages["messages"] for tc in getattr(m, "tool_calls", [])
    ]
    return tool_calls


def contains_all_tool_calls_in_order_exact_match(
    root_run: Run, example: Example
) -> dict:
    """
    Check if all expected tools are called in exact order and without any additional tool calls.
    """
    expected_trajectory = [
        "sql_db_list_tables",
        "sql_db_schema",
        "db_query_tool",
        "SubmitFinalAnswer",
    ]
    messages = root_run.outputs["response"]
    tool_calls = find_tool_calls(messages)

    # Print the tool calls for debugging
    print("Here are my tool calls:")
    print(tool_calls)

    # Check if the tool calls match the expected trajectory exactly
    if tool_calls == expected_trajectory:
        score = 1
    else:
        score = 0

    return {"score": int(score), "key": "multi_tool_call_in_exact_order"}


def contains_all_tool_calls_in_order(root_run: Run, example: Example) -> dict:
    """
    Check if all expected tools are called in order,
    but it allows for other tools to be called in between the expected ones.
    """
    messages = root_run.outputs["response"]
    tool_calls = find_tool_calls(messages)

    # Print the tool calls for debugging
    print("Here are my tool calls:")
    print(tool_calls)

    it = iter(tool_calls)
    if all(elem in it for elem in expected_trajectory):
        score = 1
    else:
        score = 0
    return {"score": int(score), "key": "multi_tool_call_in_order"}
```


```python
try:
    experiment_results = evaluate(
        predict_sql_agent_messages,
        data=dataset_name,
        evaluators=[
            contains_all_tool_calls_in_order,
            contains_all_tool_calls_in_order_exact_match,
        ],
        num_repetitions=3,
        experiment_prefix="sql-agent-multi-step-tool-calling-trajecory-in-order",
        metadata={"version": "Chinook, gpt-4o multi-step-agent"},
    )
except:
    print("Please setup LangSmith")
```

The aggregate scores show that we never correctly call the tools in exact order:

![Screenshot 2024-06-13 at 2.46.34 PM.png](9a1084c0-4c7c-4e6f-8329-80499d293e0a.png)

Looking at the logging, we can see something interesting - 

```
['sql_db_list_tables', 'sql_db_schema', 'sql_db_query', 'db_query_tool', 'SubmitFinalAnswer']
```

We appear to inject a hallucinated tool call, `sql_db_query`, into our trajectory for most of the runs.

This is why `multi_tool_call_in_exact_order` fails, but `multi_tool_call_in_order` still passes. 

We will explore ways to resolve this using LangGraph in future cookbooks!

# SQLite

>[SQLite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLite) is a database engine written in the C programming language. It is not a standalone app; rather, it is a library that software developers embed in their apps. As such, it belongs to the family of embedded databases. It is the most widely deployed database engine, as it is used by several of the top web browsers, operating systems, mobile phones, and other embedded systems.

In this walkthrough we'll create a simple conversation chain which uses `ConversationEntityMemory` backed by a `SqliteEntityStore`.


```python
# os.environ["LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2"] = "true"
# os.environ["LANGCHAIN_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass()
```

## Usage

To use the storage you need to provide only 2 things:

1. Session Id - a unique identifier of the session, like user name, email, chat id etc.
2. Connection string - a string that specifies the database connection. For SQLite, that string is `slqlite:///` followed by the name of the database file.  If that file doesn't exist, it will be created.


```python
from langchain_community.chat_message_histories import SQLChatMessageHistory

chat_message_history = SQLChatMessageHistory(
    session_id="test_session_id", connection_string="sqlite:///sqlite.db"
)

chat_message_history.add_user_message("Hello")
chat_message_history.add_ai_message("Hi")
```


```python
chat_message_history.messages
```




    [HumanMessage(content='Hello'), AIMessage(content='Hi')]



## Chaining

We can easily combine this message history class with [LCEL Runnables](/docs/how_to/message_history)

To do this we will want to use OpenAI, so we need to install that.  We will also need to set the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable to your OpenAI key.

```bash
pip install -U langchain-openai

export OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-xxxxxxx'
```


```python
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder
from langchain_core.runnables.history import RunnableWithMessageHistory
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
```


```python
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [
        ("system", "You are a helpful assistant."),
        MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name="history"),
        ("human", "{question}"),
    ]
)

chain = prompt | ChatOpenAI()
```


```python
chain_with_history = RunnableWithMessageHistory(
    chain,
    lambda session_id: SQLChatMessageHistory(
        session_id=session_id, connection_string="sqlite:///sqlite.db"
    ),
    input_messages_key="question",
    history_messages_key="history",
)
```


```python
# This is where we configure the session id
config = {"configurable": {"session_id": "<SQL_SESSION_ID>"}}
```


```python
chain_with_history.invoke({"question": "Hi! I'm bob"}, config=config)
```




    AIMessage(content='Hello Bob! How can I assist you today?')




```python
chain_with_history.invoke({"question": "Whats my name"}, config=config)
```




    AIMessage(content='Your name is Bob! Is there anything specific you would like assistance with, Bob?')

# SQLite as a Vector Store with SQLiteVec

This notebook covers how to get started with the SQLiteVec vector store.

>[SQLite-Vec](https://alexgarcia.xyz/sqlite-vec/) is an `SQLite` extension designed for vector search, emphasizing local-first operations and easy integration into applications without external servers. It is the successor to [SQLite-VSS](https://alexgarcia.xyz/sqlite-vss/) by the same author. It is written in zero-dependency C and designed to be easy to build and use.

This notebook shows how to use the `SQLiteVec` vector database.

## Setup
You'll need to install `langchain-community` with `pip install -qU langchain-community` to use this integration


```python
# You need to install sqlite-vec as a dependency.
%pip install --upgrade --quiet  sqlite-vec
```

### Credentials
SQLiteVec does not require any credentials to use as the vector store is a simple SQLite file.

## Initialization


```python
from langchain_community.embeddings.sentence_transformer import (
    SentenceTransformerEmbeddings,
)
from langchain_community.vectorstores import SQLiteVec

embedding_function = SentenceTransformerEmbeddings(model_name="all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
vector_store = SQLiteVec(
    table="state_union", db_file="/tmp/vec.db", embedding=embedding_function
)
```

## Manage vector store

### Add items to vector store


```python
vector_store.add_texts(texts=["Ketanji Brown Jackson is awesome", "foo", "bar"])
```

### Update items in vector store
Not supported yet

### Delete items from vector store
Not supported yet

## Query vector store

### Query directly


```python
data = vector_store.similarity_search("Ketanji Brown Jackson", k=4)
```

### Query by turning into retriever
Not supported yet

## Usage for retrieval-augmented generation
Refer to the documentation on sqlite-vec at https://alexgarcia.xyz/sqlite-vec/ for more information on how to use it for retrieval-augmented generation.

## API reference
For detailed documentation of all SQLiteVec features and configurations head to the API reference:https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/vectorstores/langchain_community.vectorstores.sqlitevec.SQLiteVec.html

### Other examples


```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import TextLoader
from langchain_community.embeddings.sentence_transformer import (
    SentenceTransformerEmbeddings,

# load the document and split it into chunks
loader = TextLoader("../../how_to/state_of_the_union.txt")
documents = loader.load()

# split it into chunks
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
docs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)
texts = [doc.page_content for doc in docs]


# create the open-source embedding function
embedding_function = SentenceTransformerEmbeddings(model_name="all-MiniLM-L6-v2")


# load it in sqlite-vss in a table named state_union.
# the db_file parameter is the name of the file you want
# as your sqlite database.
db = SQLiteVec.from_texts(
    texts=texts,
    embedding=embedding_function,
    table="state_union",
    db_file="/tmp/vec.db",
)

# query it
query = "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"
data = db.similarity_search(query)

# print results
data[0].page_content
```




    'Tonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you’re at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections. \n\nTonight, I’d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer—an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service. \n\nOne of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court. \n\nAnd I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation’s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence.'

Leveraging the `Faiss` library, it offers efficient similarity search and clustering capabilities.

You'll need to install `langchain-community` with `pip install -qU langchain-community` to use this integration

This notebook shows how to use the `SQLiteVSS` vector database.

# SQL (SQLAlchemy)

>[Structured Query Language (SQL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS). It is particularly useful in handling structured data, i.e., data incorporating relations among entities and variables.

>[SQLAlchemy](https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy) is an open-source `SQL` toolkit and object-relational mapper (ORM) for the Python programming language released under the MIT License.

This notebook goes over a `SQLChatMessageHistory` class that allows to store chat history in any database supported by `SQLAlchemy`.

Please note that to use it with databases other than `SQLite`, you will need to install the corresponding database driver.

## Setup

The integration lives in the `langchain-community` package, so we need to install that. We also need to install the `SQLAlchemy` package.

```bash
pip install -U langchain-community SQLAlchemy langchain-openai
```

It's also helpful (but not needed) to set up [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/) for best-in-class observability


```python
# os.environ["LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2"] = "true"
# os.environ["LANGCHAIN_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass()
```

## Usage

To use the storage you need to provide only 2 things:

1. Session Id - a unique identifier of the session, like user name, email, chat id etc.
2. Connection string - a string that specifies the database connection. It will be passed to SQLAlchemy create_engine function.


```python
from langchain_community.chat_message_histories import SQLChatMessageHistory

chat_message_history = SQLChatMessageHistory(
    session_id="test_session", connection_string="sqlite:///sqlite.db"
)

chat_message_history.add_user_message("Hello")
chat_message_history.add_ai_message("Hi")
```


```python
chat_message_history.messages
```




    [HumanMessage(content='Hello'), AIMessage(content='Hi')]



## Chaining

We can easily combine this message history class with [LCEL Runnables](/docs/how_to/message_history)

To do this we will want to use OpenAI, so we need to install that



```python
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder
from langchain_core.runnables.history import RunnableWithMessageHistory
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
```


```python
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [
        ("system", "You are a helpful assistant."),
        MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name="history"),
        ("human", "{question}"),
    ]
)

chain = prompt | ChatOpenAI()
```


```python
chain_with_history = RunnableWithMessageHistory(
    chain,
    lambda session_id: SQLChatMessageHistory(
        session_id=session_id, connection_string="sqlite:///sqlite.db"
    ),
    input_messages_key="question",
    history_messages_key="history",
)
```


```python
# This is where we configure the session id
config = {"configurable": {"session_id": "<SESSION_ID>"}}
```


```python
chain_with_history.invoke({"question": "Hi! I'm bob"}, config=config)
```




    AIMessage(content='Hello Bob! How can I assist you today?')




```python
chain_with_history.invoke({"question": "Whats my name"}, config=config)
```




    AIMessage(content='Your name is Bob! Is there anything specific you would like assistance with, Bob?')

## Overview
Large language models can be used for generating code, including SQL. In particular, models can convert natural language text into SQL queries. One common purpose is to enable users to query data without requiring knowledge of tables' names, data schema nor the specific SQL dialect or query engine of the underlying data warehouse like BigQuery.

This notebook covers prompt engineering best practices for SQL code generation, and puts in practice learnings from [SQL-PaLM: Improve Large Language Model Adaptation for text-to-SQL](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.00739.pdf). For example, the BigQuery dataset schema is retrieved and provided dynamically as context to the prompt, for grounding the LLM and personalizing its output. The notebook also demonstrates simple model evaluation whereby the generated SQL queries are evaluated by executing them against the BigQuery dataset, and by comparing them with ground truth queries and corresponding results.

For this notebook, you generate SQL queries to analyze Cloud Audit Logs and answer critical security questions around activity in your own Google Cloud project. While this notebook uses BigQuery logs dataset, the concepts and approach presented here can be applied to other databases and datasets.

![NL2SQL flow](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/nl2sql_for_log_analytics2.png)

### Objective

By the end of the notebook, you should be able to:

* Use model to generate SQL queries based on Natural Language questions:
  * Using few-shot prompting
  * Providing custom dataset schemas as context
  * Formatting model output

* Evaluate model-generated queries by:
  * Executing sanitized queries against live dataset
  * Comparing queries (and their results) to ground truth queries using simple fuzzy string matching
  * Calculating model accuracy score

In addition, you can use this notebook to answer your own security questions from your own audit logs, such as:

- Any unusually high cloud API usage by any user identity over the last month?
- Any destructive actions by an unapproved identity over the last 7 days?
- Any unusual day-to-day spike in data volume accessed by any user this week?


## Getting Started

### Prerequisite
 If you haven't already done so, the only requirement is to [upgrade your existing log bucket](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/buckets#upgrade-bucket) to use Log Analytics which provides you with a linked BigQuery dataset with your own queryable logs data. This is a **one-click step without incurring additional costs**. By default, Cloud Audit Admin Activity logs are enabled, ingested and stored in every project's `_Required` bucket without any charges.

![one click prerequisite](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/upgrade_log_bucket.png)

### Install SDKs


```
# Install Vertex AI SDK to use for model predictions
%pip install google-cloud-aiplatform google-cloud-bigquery --upgrade --user

# Install fuzzy string comparison modules for model output evaluation
%pip install -q python-Levenshtein --upgrade --user
%pip install -q fuzzywuzzy --upgrade --user
```

Install Python SDK for Google Sheets only if you wish to later save the model-generated SQL queries and their results into a Google Sheet for subsequent troubleshooting or to expand your few-shot examples dataset. This is **not applicable for Vertex AI Workbench or Colab Enterprise** because notebooks in those environments cannot access Google Drive or Google Sheets for security purposes.


```
# [Optional] Install Python SDK for Google Sheets
%pip install gspread --upgrade --user
```

**Colab only:** Uncomment the following cell to restart the kernel or use the button to restart the kernel. For Vertex AI Workbench you can restart the terminal using the button on top. 


```
# # Automatically restart kernel after installs so that your environment can access the new packages
# import IPython

# app = IPython.Application.instance()
# app.kernel.do_shutdown(True)
```

### Authenticating your notebook environment
* If you are using **Colab** to run this notebook, run the cell below and continue.
* If you are using **Vertex AI Workbench**, check out the setup instructions [here](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/generative-ai/tree/main/setup-env).


```
import sys

if "google.colab" in sys.modules:
    from google.colab import auth

    auth.authenticate_user()
```


```
# For debug only
!gcloud config list --format 'value(core.account)'
```

### Import libraries

**Colab only:** Uncomment the following cell to initialize the Vertex AI SDK. For Vertex AI Workbench, you don't need to run this.  


```
# PROJECT_ID = "[your-project-id]" # @param {type:"string"}
# LOCATION = "us-central1" # @param {type:"string"}

# from google.cloud import aiplatform
# aiplatform.init(project=PROJECT_ID, location=LOCATION)
```


```
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from vertexai.language_models import TextGenerationModel
```

### Set project and datasets for BigQuery

This is the project containing:
 - The linked BigQuery dataset `BQ_LINKED_DATASET` with your raw logs, and,
 - A new BigQuery dataset `BQ_PROCESSED_DATASET` you'll create to store the processed logs.

This project could be the same or a separate project than the one you're using for Vertex AI.

Make sure you have **BigQuery Data Viewer** role over `BQ_LINKED_DATASET` dataset.


```
BQ_PROJECT_ID = "[bq-project-id]"  # @param {type:"string"}
BQ_LINKED_DATASET = "[linked-bq-dataset]"  # @param {type:"string"}
BQ_PROCESSED_DATASET = "[new-bq-dataset]"  # @param {type:"string"}

from google.cloud import bigquery

client = bigquery.Client(project=BQ_PROJECT_ID)
```

### Import models

We will interact with Vertex AI LLM model `text-bison`:


```
MODEL_ID = "text-bison"  # @param {type:"string"}

model = TextGenerationModel.from_pretrained(MODEL_ID)
```

## Prepare the data

> You can skip this section if your raw logs are already processed and normalized in curated tables using [Dataform as part of Community Security Analytics](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/security-analytics/tree/main/dataform) (CSA). For more information on CSA and how to automatically and continuously build post-processed tables out of your raw logs, see this [Google Cloud blog post](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/deploy-community-security-analytics-with-dataform).

Like any other AI/ML project, first thing is to prepare your data including datasets for few-shot prompting and subsequent evaluation. You'll preprocess the raw logs that reside in your BigQuery linked dataset into a summary table into your new BigQuery dataset. This table will contain the logs in aggregated form and also normalized into a simple schema. This allows you to unlock and scale ML analysis:
- From a computation point of view because the dataset is smaller and simple.
- From a talent point of view because researchers and analysts are not required to be familiar with the complex schema of raw logs ([LogEntry definition](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/reference/v2/rest/v2/LogEntry)).


### Create new dataset


```
!bq --location=US mk --dataset {BQ_PROJECT_ID}:{BQ_PROCESSED_DATASET}
```

### Build table of user actions

Let's search and process the audit logs to create a table of user actions aggregated by day. This summary table reduces the set to relevant records and simplifies the structure which in turn simplifies exploratory and advanced analytics. For those interested, we use the same SQL query as defined in CSA repo, specifically [`csa_4_01_summary_daily`](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/security-analytics/blob/main/dataform/definitions/summary/csa_4_01_summary_daily.sqlx)  Dataform definition file.


```
TABLE_NAME = "csa_4_01_summary_daily"
TABLE_ID = f"{BQ_PROJECT_ID}.{BQ_PROCESSED_DATASET}.{TABLE_NAME}"
SUMMARY_LOOKBACK_DAYS = 90

job_config = bigquery.QueryJobConfig(
    destination=TABLE_ID, write_disposition="WRITE_TRUNCATE"
)

sql = f"""
SELECT
  EXTRACT(DATE FROM timestamp) AS day,
  proto_payload.audit_log.authentication_info.principal_email,
  ARRAY_AGG(DISTINCT proto_payload.audit_log.method_name IGNORE NULLS) AS actions,
  COUNT(*) AS counter
FROM `{BQ_PROJECT_ID}.{BQ_LINKED_DATASET}._AllLogs`
WHERE
  timestamp >=  TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL {SUMMARY_LOOKBACK_DAYS} DAY)
  AND proto_payload.audit_log.authentication_info.principal_email IS NOT NULL
  AND proto_payload.audit_log.method_name NOT LIKE "storage.%.get"
  AND proto_payload.audit_log.method_name NOT LIKE "v1.compute.%.list"
  AND proto_payload.audit_log.method_name NOT LIKE "beta.compute.%.list"
GROUP BY
  day,
  proto_payload.audit_log.authentication_info.principal_email
"""

# Start the query and save results in new table
query_job = client.query(sql, job_config=job_config)
result = query_job.result()  # Wait for the job to complete.

print(f"{result.total_rows} user action records loaded to table {TABLE_ID}")
```

### Import sample queries

You will now retrieve a list of 15 sample security questions and corresponding SQL queries from a CSV file. These security questions are variations from the open-source [Community Security Analytics](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/security-analytics). CSA provides a set of security questions and corresponding queries for BigQuery, Log Analytics and Chronicle.

We will use a subset of these queries as few-shot examples as part of the model prompt, and the remaining set for model evaluation.

Run the following to read the CSV file from a GCS bucket and load all records into an in-memory pandas DataFrame:


```
BUCKET_ID = "csa-datasets-public"  # @param {type:"string"}
FILENAME = "SQL_Generator_Example_Queries.csv"  # @param {type:"string"}

df = pd.read_csv(f"gs://{BUCKET_ID}/{FILENAME}", header=0)
df.head(2)
```

Retrieve table name referenced by the sample questions. This should be the same as the table of post-processed logs we created above.


```
# Retrieve unique table names excluding null values and empty string
BQ_TABLES = df["Qualified table name"].replace("", np.nan).dropna().unique()
print(BQ_TABLES)
```

### Extract train & eval datasets

Extract train & eval datasets and store in respective dataframes:


```
train_df = df.loc[df["Dataset"] == "Train", ["Question", "SQL Query"]]
eval_df = df.loc[df["Dataset"] == "Eval", ["Question", "SQL Query"]]
```

Take a peek at a few records from each set:


```
train_df.head(5)
```


```
eval_df.head(5)
```

## Prepare few-shot prompt


### Define prompt template

The model prompt will include the following components:
1. Concise statement to specify the task
1. Schema definition to describe existing dataset
1. A few shot examples of questions in natural language and corresponding SQL statements

This is the template we will later use to generate the prompt using these 3 components.


```
# This string template takes three arguments:
# - schema definition
# - few shot examples
# - question for which query needs to be generated

prompt_template = """\
This is a task converting text into GoogleSQL statement.
We will first give you the dataset schema and then ask a question in text.
You are asked to generate SQL statement which is valid for BigQuery.
Remove any delimiters around answer such as "```"

BigQuery tables schema definition:
{schema_definition}
Here are a few shot examples:
{few_examples}
Write GoogleSQL query for following question: {question}
Answer: "Query here"
"""
```

### Build schema definition (compact version)

First, we need to build a concise schema definition of your dataset. As mentioned earlier, we'll use that as part of our prompt's context for grounding the results.

Retrieve table and column definitions from the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` of your BigQuery dataset.


```
# Following SQL query will generate schema definition of your dataset
QUERY = f"""\
SELECT
    '[Schema (values)]: ' || '| log_summary | ' || STRING_AGG(table_values, ' | ') || ';' AS tables_definition,
    '[Column names (type)]: ' || STRING_AGG(column_names_types) || ';' AS columns_definition
FROM (
    SELECT
      table_name,
      table_name || ' : ' || STRING_AGG(column_name, ' , ') as table_values,
      STRING_AGG(table_name || ' : ' || column_name || ' (' || data_type || ')', ' | ') as column_names_types
    FROM {BQ_PROJECT_ID}.{BQ_PROCESSED_DATASET}.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMN_FIELD_PATHS
    WHERE table_name IN {'(' + ",".join(map(lambda x: f"'{x}'", BQ_TABLES)) + ')'}
    GROUP BY table_name
    ORDER BY table_name
)
"""

# Create query job
query_job = client.query(QUERY)
# Get first row
schema = next(query_job.result())

# Build schema definition
schema_definition = f"""\
{schema.tables_definition}

{schema.columns_definition}
"""

print(schema_definition)
```

### Add queries as few-shot examples

This is a helper function to format example input and output within the prompt. We will use this helper function as we add shots to the prompt.


```
one_shot_template = """
Question: {question}

Answer: {query}
"""
```

Let's add queries from our dataset as examples to our prompt:


```
few_examples = ""
for index, row in train_df.iterrows():
    few_examples += one_shot_template.format(
        question=row["Question"], query=row["SQL Query"]
    )

print(f"Added {str(train_df.shape[0])} pairs as few-shot examples")
```

### Review full prompt

Using the schema definition, the few shot examples, and a sample question to be answered, let's generate a full prompt as an example.


```
question = "This is a sample question"

prompt = prompt_template.format(
    schema_definition=schema_definition, few_examples=few_examples, question=question
)
print("Prompt:")
print(prompt)

print("Number of input tokens: " + str(len(prompt)))
```

## Generate SQL queries

### Define helper function to generate SQL

The following helper function `generate_sql()` is used to retrieve a SQL query from the Vertex AI LLM model using the prompt template we have built thus far.

Notice how `generate_sql()` uses `sanitize_output()` function to strip the response down to the SQL query itself before returning the results. Even though the model prompt includes instructions to tune the model output, there may still be enclosing quotes or code block backticks which need to be stripped out to avoid a subsequent SQL syntax error.


```
import re


# Strip text to include only the SQL code block with
def sanitize_output(text: str) -> str:
    # Strip whitespace and any potential backticks enclosing the code block
    text = text.strip()
    regex = re.compile(r"^\s*```(\w+)?|```\s*$")
    text = regex.sub("", text).strip()

    # Find and remove any trailing quote without corresponding opening quote
    if re.search(r'^[^"]*"$', text):
        text = text[:-1]
    # Find and remove any leading quote without corresponding closing quote
    if re.search(r'^"[^"]*$', text):
        text = text[1:]

    return text


# Call model using prompt and pre-defined parameters
def generate_sql(
    model,
    prompt: str,
    temperature: float = 0.2,
    max_output_tokens: int = 1024,
    top_k: int = 40,
    top_p: float = 0.8,
) -> str:
    print("Generating SQL...")
    print("Number of input tokens: " + str(len(prompt)))

    response = model.predict(
        prompt,
        temperature=temperature,
        max_output_tokens=max_output_tokens,
        top_k=top_k,
        top_p=top_p,
    )

    text = response.text
    print("Number of output tokens: " + str(len(text)))
    print("Response:")
    print(text)

    # Strip text to include only the SQL code block
    text = sanitize_output(text)
    print("Response stripped:")
    print(text)

    return text
```

### Define helper function to execute SQL

The following helper function `execute_sql()` is used to execute a SQL query against the live BigQuery dataset, and returning results as a dataframe.

Notice how `execute_sql()` ensures to qualify table names with the project and BigQuery dataset you specified above, before executing the SQL query. 


```
# Limit number of bytes processed as a guardrail for cost control
BQ_MAX_BYTES_BILLED = pow(2, 30)  # 1GB


def execute_sql(query: str):
    print("Executing SQL...")

    # Qualify table names with your project and dataset ID
    for table_name in BQ_TABLES:
        query = query.replace(
            table_name, f"{BQ_PROJECT_ID}.{BQ_PROCESSED_DATASET}.{table_name}"
        )

    print("Query:")
    print(query)

    # Validate the query by performing a dry run without incurring a charge
    job_config = bigquery.QueryJobConfig(use_query_cache=False, dry_run=True)
    try:
        response = client.query(query, job_config=job_config)
    except Exception as e:
        print("Error validating query:")
        print(e)
        return e

    print(f"Query will process {response.total_bytes_processed / 1024:.2f} KB.")

    # Execute the query
    job_config = bigquery.QueryJobConfig(
        use_query_cache=False, maximum_bytes_billed=BQ_MAX_BYTES_BILLED
    )
    try:
        response = client.query(query)
        df = response.to_dataframe()
    except Exception as e:
        print("Error executing query:")
        print(e)
        return e

    return df
```

### Example 1

Let's generate the SQL to answer this sample question:

*List all user actions that contains the word 'delete' or 'remove' over the last month. Include the user and the day in the results.*



```
question = "List all user actions that contains the word 'delete' or 'remove' over the last month. Include the user and the day in the results."

query = generate_sql(
    model,
    prompt_template.format(
        schema_definition=schema_definition,
        few_examples=few_examples,
        question=question,
    ),
)
```

Let's test the generated query with the live dataset in BigQuery.



```
# Execute the query
query_result = execute_sql(query)
print(query_result)
```

### Example 2

Let's generate the SQL to answer this sample question:

*List any action containing IAM case-insensitive by any unapproved user over the last 7 days, where approved user include 'admin@example.com'.*



```
question = "List any action containing IAM case-insensitive by any unapproved user over the last 7 days, where approved user include 'admin@example.com'"

query = generate_sql(
    model,
    prompt_template.format(
        schema_definition=schema_definition,
        few_examples=few_examples,
        question=question,
    ),
)
```

Let's test the generated query against your BigQuery dataset:


```
# Execute the query
query_result = execute_sql(query)
print(query_result)
```

## Evaluate model

### Run model on evaluation dataset

Let's generate SQL queries for all questions in our evaluation dataset. That dataset includes both `Question` and the ground truth `SQL Query`. Run the following code to automatically call the model for each question in the dataset and record the response in a new column `Generated SQL Query`. This may take few minutes as model calls are done serially.



```
eval_df["Generated SQL Query"] = eval_df["Question"].apply(
    lambda x: generate_sql(
        model,
        prompt_template.format(
            schema_definition=schema_definition, few_examples=few_examples, question=x
        ),
    )
)

eval_df
```


```
len(eval_df)
```

### Execute ground truth queries

Before we evaluate our generated queries, let's run the "ground truth" queries as part of our dataset.


```
eval_df["SQL Query Result"] = eval_df["SQL Query"].apply(execute_sql)
```

Let's peak into the results


```
eval_df.loc[:, ["SQL Query", "SQL Query Result"]]
```

### Execute generated queries


```
eval_df["Generated SQL Query Result"] = eval_df["Generated SQL Query"].apply(
    execute_sql
)
```

Let's peek into some of the results


```
eval_df.loc[:, ["Generated SQL Query", "Generated SQL Query Result"]].head()
```

### Serialize results

 Since the results of each successful query are represented as a nested DataFrame within the evaluation DataFrame, we need to first serialize them so it's easier to compare the results, and to optionally save them in a spreadsheet or a CSV file.


```
def format_query_result(query_result):
    if isinstance(query_result, pd.DataFrame):
        if query_result.shape[0] == 0:
            return "No results found"
        return query_result.to_csv(index=False)
    elif isinstance(query_result, Exception):
        return query_result.message
    else:
        return query_result


eval_df["Generated SQL Query Result Formatted"] = eval_df[
    "Generated SQL Query Result"
].apply(format_query_result)
eval_df["SQL Query Result Formatted"] = eval_df["SQL Query Result"].apply(
    format_query_result
)
```

Inspect the results


```
eval_df.head()
```

### Calculate match score

Let's evaluate the model accuracy by calculating a match score for each pair of queries. In our case, we'll calculate score based on fuzzy string matching of each generated query with the corresponding ground truth query.

Let's import and use `fuzzywuzzy` library which we already installed along with `Levenshtein` module for fast computation of Levenshtein distance between two strings:



```
from fuzzywuzzy import fuzz


def get_match_of_queries(df):
    return fuzz.partial_ratio(df["SQL Query"], df["Generated SQL Query"])


eval_df["match_score_queries"] = eval_df.apply(get_match_of_queries, axis=1)
eval_df.loc[:, ["SQL Query", "Generated SQL Query", "match_score_queries"]]
```

Now calculate the mean score across all questions


```
print(
    "The average match score based on raw generated queries is: ",
    round(eval_df["match_score_queries"].mean(), 2),
    "%",
)
```

The generated queries might have a different SQL implementation or variables naming than the 'ground truth' query, yet still yield the correct answer to the security question. So calculating the match score of each query string with its corresponding 'ground truth' query string is not a sufficient evaluation method. Therefore, we'll also calculate the match score between the actual results returned from your dataset.

Let's run the fuzzy match logic on the formatted version of the results. That formatted column is already stringified and ready for string comparison. This may take several minutes to complete depending on size of actual results being compared.


```
def get_match_of_results(df):
    return fuzz.partial_ratio(
        df["SQL Query Result Formatted"], df["Generated SQL Query Result Formatted"]
    )


# This may take several minutes to complete
eval_df["match_score"] = eval_df.apply(get_match_of_results, axis=1)
eval_df.loc[
    :,
    [
        "SQL Query",
        "Generated SQL Query",
        "SQL Query Result Formatted",
        "Generated SQL Query Result Formatted",
        "match_score_queries",
        "match_score",
    ],
]
```

Now calculate the mean score across all questions


```
print(
    "The average match score of all generated queries is: ",
    round(eval_df["match_score"].mean(), 2),
    "%",
)
```

## [Optional] Save results in Google Sheets

You may want to save all generated queries, results and scores into a Google Sheet for visual inspection and for future reference like model accuracy tracking.

Skip this section if using **Vertex AI Workbench** or **Colab Enterprise** because notebooks in those environments cannot access Google Drive or Google Sheets for security purposes.

Create a new spreadsheet in Google Sheets (https://sheets.new) and copy over your unique spreadsheet ID into `QUERIES_SHEET_ID` parameter.  You can find your spreadsheet ID in the Google Sheets URL: docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/*spreadsheetId*/edit#gid=0



```
QUERIES_SHEET_ID = ""  # @param {type:"string"}
QUERIES_WORKSHEET_NAME = "Evaluation Dataset"  # @param {type:"string"}
```


```
from google.auth import default
import gspread

# Authenticate with Google Sheets
creds, _ = default()
gc = gspread.authorize(creds)

wks_results = gc.open_by_key(QUERIES_SHEET_ID).worksheet(QUERIES_WORKSHEET_NAME)

# Drop Query Result column which may contain non-serializable objects
eval_df_copy = eval_df.drop(columns=["SQL Query Result", "Generated SQL Query Result"])


def limit_cell_length(cell) -> str:
    if len(cell) >= 50000:
        return cell[:49990] + "..."
    return cell


eval_df_copy["Generated SQL Query Result Formatted"] = eval_df_copy[
    "Generated SQL Query Result Formatted"
].apply(limit_cell_length)
eval_df_copy["SQL Query Result Formatted"] = eval_df_copy[
    "SQL Query Result Formatted"
].apply(limit_cell_length)

wks_results.update(
    [eval_df_copy.columns.values.tolist()] + eval_df_copy.values.tolist()
)
```

## Overview
Large language models can be used for generating code, including SQL. In particular, models can convert natural language text into SQL queries. One common purpose is to enable users to query data without requiring knowledge of tables' names, data schema nor the specific SQL dialect or query engine of the underlying data warehouse like BigQuery.

This notebook covers prompt engineering best practices for SQL code generation with [LangChain Google Cloud Vertex AI](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/llms/google_vertex_ai_palm) implementation, and puts in practice learnings from [SQL-PaLM: Improve Large Language Model Adaptation for text-to-SQL](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.00739.pdf). For example, the BigQuery dataset schema is retrieved and provided dynamically as context to the prompt, for grounding the LLM and personalizing its output. The notebook also demonstrates Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) by using [SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/model_io/prompts/example_selector_types/similarity) from LangChain Example Selector to dynamically retrieve and pass the most relevant few shot examples to enrich the LLM prompt. This helps ensure most accurate and relevant LLM output, that is the generated SQL query, while limiting number of required LLM input tokens and thereby cost. The notebook also demonstrates simple model evaluation whereby the generated SQL queries are evaluated by executing them against the BigQuery dataset, and by comparing them with ground truth queries and corresponding results.

For this notebook, you generate SQL queries to analyze Cloud Audit Logs and answer critical security questions around activity in your own Google Cloud project. While this notebook uses BigQuery logs dataset, the concepts and approach presented here can be applied to other databases and datasets.

![NL2SQL flow](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/nl2sql_for_log_analytics2.png)

### Objective

By the end of the notebook, you should be able to:

* Use model to generate SQL queries based on Natural Language questions:
  * Use VertexAIEmbeddings to create embeddings
  * Use LangChain Example Selector to automatically select relevant examples for few-shot prompting
  * Providing custom dataset schemas as context
  * Formatting model output

* Evaluate model-generated queries by:
  * Executing sanitized queries against live dataset
  * Comparing queries (and their results) to ground truth queries using pandas dataframe equals check
  * Calculating model accuracy score

In addition, you can use this notebook to answer your own security questions from your own audit logs, such as:

- Any unusually high cloud API usage by any user identity over the last month?
- Any destructive actions by an unapproved identity over the last 7 days?
- Any unusual day-to-day spike in data volume accessed by any user this week?


## Getting Started

### Prerequisite
 If you haven't already done so, the only requirement is to [upgrade your existing log bucket](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/buckets#upgrade-bucket) to use Log Analytics which provides you with a linked BigQuery dataset with your own queryable logs data. This is a **one-click step without incurring additional costs**. By default, Cloud Audit Admin Activity logs are enabled, ingested and stored in every project's `_Required` bucket without any charges.

![one click prerequisite](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/upgrade_log_bucket.png)

### Install SDKs


```
# Install Vertex AI SDK to use for model predictions
%pip install google-cloud-aiplatform google-cloud-bigquery pandas --upgrade --user
%pip install --upgrade --quiet langchain langchain-core langchain-google-vertexai
%pip install langchain-community faiss-cpu
```

**Colab only:** Uncomment the following cell to restart the kernel or use the button to restart the kernel. For Vertex AI Workbench you can restart the terminal using the button on top.


```
# # Automatically restart kernel after installs so that your environment can access the new packages
# import IPython
# app = IPython.Application.instance()
# app.kernel.do_shutdown(True)
```

### Import Libraries


```
import re
import sys

from IPython.display import display
from google.cloud import aiplatform, bigquery
from langchain.prompts.example_selector import SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector
from langchain.prompts.few_shot import FewShotPromptTemplate
from langchain.prompts.prompt import PromptTemplate
from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain_google_vertexai import VertexAI, VertexAIEmbeddings
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
```

### Set project and datasets for BigQuery

This is the project containing:
 - The linked BigQuery dataset `BQ_LINKED_DATASET` with your raw logs, and,
 - A new BigQuery dataset `BQ_PROCESSED_DATASET` you'll create to store the processed logs.

This project could be the same or a separate project than the one you're using for Vertex AI.

Make sure you have **BigQuery Data Viewer** role over `BQ_LINKED_DATASET` dataset.


```
PROJECT_ID = ""  # @param {type:"string"}
LOCATION_US = "US"  # @param {type:"string"}
LOCATION = "us-central1"  # @param {type:"string
BQ_LINKED_DATASET = ""  # @param {type:"string"}
BQ_PROCESSED_DATASET = ""  # @param {type:"string"}

aiplatform.init(project=PROJECT_ID, location=LOCATION)
```

### Authenticating your notebook environment
* If you are using **Colab** to run this notebook, run the cell below and continue.
* If you are using **Vertex AI Workbench**, check out the setup instructions [here](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/generative-ai/tree/main/setup-env).


```
if "google.colab" in sys.modules:
    from google.colab import auth

    auth.authenticate_user()
```

### Set Embedding and Vertex AI LLM Model

In the current example we are using text-bison@002 large language model but you can use other Google provided models gemini, gemini-pro, ulta, etc. For embedding we are using textembedding-gecko with the latest version.


```
MODEL_ID = "text-bison@002"  # @param {type:"string"}
EMBEDDING_MODEL_ID = "textembedding-gecko@latest"  # @param {type:"string"}
```

### Import sample queries

You will now retrieve a list of 15 sample security questions and corresponding SQL queries from a CSV file. These security questions are variations from the open-source [Community Security Analytics](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/security-analytics). CSA provides a set of security questions and corresponding queries for BigQuery, Log Analytics and Chronicle.

We will use a subset of these queries as few-shot examples as part of the model prompt, and the remaining set for model evaluation.

Run the following to read the CSV file from a GCS bucket and load all records into an in-memory pandas DataFrame:


```
BUCKET_ID = "csa-datasets-public"  # @param {type:"string"}
FILENAME = "SQL_Generator_Example_Queries.csv"  # @param {type:"string"}
df = pd.read_csv(f"gs://{BUCKET_ID}/{FILENAME}", header=0)
```

### Extract train & eval datasets

Extract train & eval datasets and store in respective dataframes:


```
train_df = df.loc[df["Dataset"] == "Train", ["Question", "SQL Query"]]
eval_df = df.loc[df["Dataset"] == "Eval", ["Question", "SQL Query"]]
train_dict = (
    train_df[["Question", "SQL Query"]]
    .rename(columns={"SQL Query": "answer"})
    .rename(columns={"Question": "question"})
    .to_dict(orient="records")
)
train_df.head(2)
```

## Prepare the data

> You can skip this section if your raw logs are already processed and normalized in curated tables using [Dataform as part of Community Security Analytics](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/security-analytics/tree/main/dataform) (CSA). For more information on CSA and how to automatically and continuously build post-processed tables out of your raw logs, see this [Google Cloud blog post](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/deploy-community-security-analytics-with-dataform).

Like any other AI/ML project, first thing is to prepare your data including datasets for few-shot prompting and subsequent evaluation. You'll preprocess the raw logs that reside in your BigQuery linked dataset into a summary table into your new BigQuery dataset. This table will contain the logs in aggregated form and also normalized into a simple schema. This allows you to unlock and scale ML analysis:
- From a computation point of view because the dataset is smaller and simple.
- From a talent point of view because researchers and analysts are not required to be familiar with the complex schema of raw logs ([LogEntry definition](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/reference/v2/rest/v2/LogEntry)).


### Create new dataset


```
!bq --location=LOCATION_US mk --dataset {BQ_PROJECT_ID}:{BQ_PROCESSED_DATASET}
```

Create new csa_4_01_summary_daily using log analytics BigQuery table


```
TABLE_NAME = "csa_4_01_summary_daily"
TABLE_ID = f"{PROJECT_ID}.{BQ_PROCESSED_DATASET}.{TABLE_NAME}"
SUMMARY_LOOKBACK_DAYS = 90

client = bigquery.Client(project=PROJECT_ID, location=LOCATION_US)
client.create_dataset(dataset=BQ_PROCESSED_DATASET, exists_ok=True)

job_config = bigquery.QueryJobConfig(
    destination=TABLE_ID, write_disposition="WRITE_TRUNCATE"
)

sql = f"""
SELECT
  EXTRACT(DATE FROM timestamp) AS day,
  proto_payload.audit_log.authentication_info.principal_email,
  ARRAY_AGG(DISTINCT proto_payload.audit_log.method_name IGNORE NULLS) AS actions,
  COUNT(*) AS counter
FROM `{PROJECT_ID}.{BQ_LINKED_DATASET}._AllLogs`
WHERE
  timestamp >=  TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL {SUMMARY_LOOKBACK_DAYS} DAY)
  AND proto_payload.audit_log.authentication_info.principal_email IS NOT NULL
  AND proto_payload.audit_log.method_name NOT LIKE "storage.%.get"
  AND proto_payload.audit_log.method_name NOT LIKE "v1.compute.%.list"
  AND proto_payload.audit_log.method_name NOT LIKE "beta.compute.%.list"
GROUP BY
  day,
  proto_payload.audit_log.authentication_info.principal_email
"""

# Start the query and save results in new table
query_job = client.query(sql, job_config=job_config)
result = query_job.result()  # Wait for the job to complete.

print(f"{result.total_rows} user action records loaded to table {TABLE_ID}")
```

### Build schema definition (compact version)

First, we need to build a concise schema definition of your dataset. As mentioned earlier, we'll use that as part of our prompt's context for grounding the results.

Retrieve table and column definitions from the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` of your BigQuery dataset.


```
# Following SQL query will generate schema definition of your dataset

BQ_TABLES = df["Qualified table name"].replace("", np.nan).dropna().unique()
print(BQ_TABLES)
QUERY = f"""\
SELECT
    '[Schema (values)]: ' || '| log_summary | ' || STRING_AGG(table_values, ' | ') || ';' AS tables_definition,
    '[Column names (type)]: ' || STRING_AGG(column_names_types) || ';' AS columns_definition
FROM (
    SELECT
      table_name,
      table_name || ' : ' || STRING_AGG(column_name, ' , ') as table_values,
      STRING_AGG(table_name || ' : ' || column_name || ' (' || data_type || ')', ' | ') as column_names_types
    FROM {PROJECT_ID}.{BQ_PROCESSED_DATASET}.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMN_FIELD_PATHS
    WHERE table_name IN {'(' + ",".join(map(lambda x: f"'{x}'", BQ_TABLES)) + ')'}
    GROUP BY table_name
    ORDER BY table_name
)
"""

# Create query job
query_job = client.query(QUERY)
# Get first row
schema = next(query_job.result())

# Build schema definition
schema_definition = f"""\
{schema.tables_definition}

{schema.columns_definition}
"""

print(schema_definition)
```

### Build Prompt

Lets create prompt using user input and few shots extracted dynamically using LangChain FewShotPromptTemplate

#### Create Vertex AI embeddings to create a text embedding  


```
embedding = VertexAIEmbeddings(model_name=EMBEDDING_MODEL_ID, project=PROJECT_ID)
```

#### Create Few Shot Prompt

The `SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector` selects examples based on a combination of which examples are most similar to the inputs


```
example_selector = SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector.from_examples(
    # This is the list of examples available to select from.
    train_dict,
    # This is the embedding class used to produce embeddings which are used to measure semantic similarity.
    embedding,
    # This is the VectorStore class that is used to store the embeddings and do a similarity search over.
    FAISS,
    # This is the number of examples to produce.
    k=2,
)

# Select the most similar example to the input.
question = "select user actions that contains the word 'delete' or 'remove'"
selected_examples = example_selector.select_examples({"question": question})
print(f"Examples most similar to the input: {question}")
for example in selected_examples:
    print("\n")
    for k, v in example.items():
        print(f"{k}: {v}")
```

#### Helper Function to Build Prompt

Below function will be utilised to converting user input into actual prompt with few shots and a prefix


```
def build_prompt(user_prompt, example_selector):
    prompt_template = f"""\
    This is a task converting text into GoogleSQL statement.
    We will first give you the dataset schema and then ask a question in text.
    You are asked to generate SQL statement which is valid for BigQuery.
    Remove any delimiters around answer such as "```"

    BigQuery tables schema definition:
    {schema_definition}
    Here are a few shot examples:
    """
    example_prompt = PromptTemplate(
        input_variables=["question", "answer"],
        template="question: {question}\nanswer: {answer}",
    )

    prompt = FewShotPromptTemplate(
        example_selector=example_selector,
        example_prompt=example_prompt,
        prefix=prompt_template,
        suffix="question: {question}\nanswer: ",
        input_variables=["question"],
    )
    final_prompt = prompt.format(question=user_prompt)
    return final_prompt
```

## Generate SQL queries

### Define helper function to generate SQL

`generate_sql()`: This function is used to retrieve a SQL query from the Vertex AI LLM model using the prompt template we have built thus far.

`execute_sql()`: This function is used to execute a SQL query against the live BigQuery dataset, and returning results as a dataframe.

`build_prompt()`: This function is used to create the final prompt which includes common prefix and suffix for all the prompts

Notice how `generate_sql()` uses `sanitize_output()` function to strip the response down to the SQL query itself before returning the results. Even though the model prompt includes instructions to tune the model output, there may still be enclosing quotes or code block backticks which need to be stripped out to avoid a subsequent SQL syntax error.


```
# Limit number of bytes processed as a guardrail for cost control
BQ_MAX_BYTES_BILLED = pow(2, 30)  # 1GB


def execute_sql(query: str):
    print("Executing SQL...")

    # Qualify table names with your project and dataset ID
    for table_name in BQ_TABLES:
        query = query.replace(
            table_name, f"{PROJECT_ID}.{BQ_PROCESSED_DATASET}.{table_name}"
        )

    # Validate the query by performing a dry run without incurring a charge
    job_config = bigquery.QueryJobConfig(use_query_cache=False, dry_run=True)
    try:
        response = client.query(query, job_config=job_config)
    except Exception as e:
        print("Error validating query:")
        print(e)
        return e

    print(f"Query will process {response.total_bytes_processed / 1024:.2f} KB.")

### Example 1

Let's generate the SQL to answer this sample question:

*List all user actions that contains the word 'delete' or 'remove' over the last month. Include the user and the day in the results.*



```
user_prompt = "List all user actions that contains the word 'delete' or 'remove' over the last month. Include the user and the day in the results."

final_generated_prompt = build_prompt(user_prompt, example_selector)
print(final_generated_prompt)
```

Let's test the generated query with the live dataset in BigQuery.


```
output = generate_sql(example_selector, user_prompt)
print(output)
```

Let's test the generated query against your BigQuery dataset:


```
# Execute the query
query_result = execute_sql(output)
display(query_result.head(2))
```

### Example 2

Let's generate the SQL to answer this sample question:

*List all user actions that contains the word 'delete' or 'remove' over the last month. Include the user and the day in the results.*



```
user_prompt = "List any action containing IAM case-insensitive by any unapproved user over the last 7 days, where approved user include 'admin@example.com'"

final_generated_prompt = build_prompt(user_prompt, example_selector)
print(final_generated_prompt)
```

Let's test the generated query with the live dataset in BigQuery.


```
output = generate_sql(example_selector, user_prompt)
print(output)
```

Let's test the generated query against your BigQuery dataset:


```
# Execute the query
query_result = execute_sql(output)
display(query_result.head(2))
```

## Evaluate model

### Run model on evaluation dataset

Let's generate SQL queries for all questions in our evaluation dataset. That dataset includes both `Question` and the ground truth `SQL Query`. Run the following code to automatically call the model for each question in the dataset and record the response in a new column `Generated SQL Query`. This may take few minutes as model calls are done serially.



```
eval_df["Generated SQL Query"] = eval_df["Question"].apply(
    lambda x: generate_sql(example_selector, x)
)
```

### Compare output result

In the next code cell, we'll execute the original SQL query and then compare its output directly to the output of the generated SQL query.


```
def compare_dataframes(sql_query, generated_sql_query):
    """Compares two pandas DataFrames row-wise using columns from the second DataFrame.
    Args:
        SQL Query, Generated SQL Query
    Returns:
        True if output of both the SQL queries matches otherwise False
    """
    df1 = execute_sql(sql_query)
    df2 = execute_sql(generated_sql_query)

    # If generated query returned an error instead of a dataframe with results:
    if not isinstance(df2, pd.DataFrame):
        return False

    try:
        df2 = df2[df1.columns]
    except KeyError:
        # Columns in results of ground truth query are missing
        # from results returned by generated query
        return False

    comparison_result = df2.eq(df1)
    matching_rows = comparison_result.all(axis=1)
    matching_count = matching_rows.sum()
    # return df1, df2
    return True if matching_count == len(df1) else False


eval_df["Data Match"] = eval_df.apply(
    lambda x: compare_dataframes(x["SQL Query"], x["Generated SQL Query"]), axis=1
)
# eval_df["sql_query_output"],eval_df["generated_sql_query_output"] = eval_df.apply(lambda x: compare_dataframes(x["SQL Query"], x["Generated SQL Query"]), axis=1)

# Note: To save the output data to the final dataframe, make these changes: 1. Uncomment lines 26 and 30. 2. Comment out line 29.
```

## Final Result

In the next cell, we'll calculate the model's final score. This score represents the percentage of successful matches between the original and generated queries, as indicated in the 'Data Match' column.

### Score


```
def get_prcntg_match(eval_df):
    return round(eval_df["Data Match"].sum() / len(eval_df) * 100)


prcntg_match = get_prcntg_match(eval_df)
print(f"Final Score based on the percentage of data match: {prcntg_match}%")
```

### Output


```
pd.set_option("display.max_rows", None)
pd.set_option("display.max_columns", None)
pd.set_option("display.width", None)
pd.set_option("display.max_colwidth", -1)
display(eval_df)
```

# How to do question answering over CSVs

LLMs are great for building question-answering systems over various types of data sources. In this section we'll go over how to build Q&A systems over data stored in a CSV file(s). Like working with SQL databases, the key to working with CSV files is to give an LLM access to tools for querying and interacting with the data. The two main ways to do this are to either:

* **RECOMMENDED**: Load the CSV(s) into a SQL database, and use the approaches outlined in the [SQL tutorial](/docs/tutorials/sql_qa).
* Give the LLM access to a Python environment where it can use libraries like Pandas to interact with the data.

We will cover both approaches in this guide.

## ⚠️ Security note ⚠️

Both approaches mentioned above carry significant risks. Using SQL requires executing model-generated SQL queries. Using a library like Pandas requires letting the model execute Python code. Since it is easier to tightly scope SQL connection permissions and sanitize SQL queries than it is to sandbox Python environments, **we HIGHLY recommend interacting with CSV data via SQL.** For more on general security best practices, [see here](/docs/security).

## Setup
Dependencies for this guide:


```python
%pip install -qU langchain langchain-openai langchain-community langchain-experimental pandas
```

Set required environment variables:


```python
# Using LangSmith is recommended but not required. Uncomment below lines to use.
# import os
# os.environ["LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2"] = "true"
# os.environ["LANGCHAIN_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass()
```

Download the [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset) if you don't already have it:


```python
!wget https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs109/cs109.1166/stuff/titanic.csv -O titanic.csv
```


```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("titanic.csv")
print(df.shape)
print(df.columns.tolist())
```

    (887, 8)
    ['Survived', 'Pclass', 'Name', 'Sex', 'Age', 'Siblings/Spouses Aboard', 'Parents/Children Aboard', 'Fare']
    

## SQL

Using SQL to interact with CSV data is the recommended approach because it is easier to limit permissions and sanitize queries than with arbitrary Python.

Most SQL databases make it easy to load a CSV file in as a table ([DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/docs/data/csv/overview.html), [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/csv.html), etc.). Once you've done this you can use all of the chain and agent-creating techniques outlined in the [SQL tutorial](/docs/tutorials/sql_qa). Here's a quick example of how we might do this with SQLite:


```python
from langchain_community.utilities import SQLDatabase
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

engine = create_engine("sqlite:///titanic.db")
df.to_sql("titanic", engine, index=False)
```




    887




```python
db = SQLDatabase(engine=engine)
print(db.dialect)
print(db.get_usable_table_names())
print(db.run("SELECT * FROM titanic WHERE Age < 2;"))
```

    sqlite
    ['titanic']
    [(1, 2, 'Master. Alden Gates Caldwell', 'male', 0.83, 0, 2, 29.0), (0, 3, 'Master. Eino Viljami Panula', 'male', 1.0, 4, 1, 39.6875), (1, 3, 'Miss. Eleanor Ileen Johnson', 'female', 1.0, 1, 1, 11.1333), (1, 2, 'Master. Richard F Becker', 'male', 1.0, 2, 1, 39.0), (1, 1, 'Master. Hudson Trevor Allison', 'male', 0.92, 1, 2, 151.55), (1, 3, 'Miss. Maria Nakid', 'female', 1.0, 0, 2, 15.7417), (0, 3, 'Master. Sidney Leonard Goodwin', 'male', 1.0, 5, 2, 46.9), (1, 3, 'Miss. Helene Barbara Baclini', 'female', 0.75, 2, 1, 19.2583), (1, 3, 'Miss. Eugenie Baclini', 'female', 0.75, 2, 1, 19.2583), (1, 2, 'Master. Viljo Hamalainen', 'male', 0.67, 1, 1, 14.5), (1, 3, 'Master. Bertram Vere Dean', 'male', 1.0, 1, 2, 20.575), (1, 3, 'Master. Assad Alexander Thomas', 'male', 0.42, 0, 1, 8.5167), (1, 2, 'Master. Andre Mallet', 'male', 1.0, 0, 2, 37.0042), (1, 2, 'Master. George Sibley Richards', 'male', 0.83, 1, 1, 18.75)]
    

And create a [SQL agent](/docs/tutorials/sql_qa) to interact with it:

import ChatModelTabs from "@theme/ChatModelTabs";

<ChatModelTabs customVarName="llm" />



```python
# | output: false
# | echo: false

from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI()
```


```python
from langchain_community.agent_toolkits import create_sql_agent

agent_executor = create_sql_agent(llm, db=db, agent_type="openai-tools", verbose=True)
```


```python
agent_executor.invoke({"input": "what's the average age of survivors"})
```

    {'input': "what's the average age of survivors",
     'output': 'The average age of survivors in the Titanic dataset is approximately 28.41 years.'}



This approach easily generalizes to multiple CSVs, since we can just load each of them into our database as its own table. See the [Multiple CSVs](/docs/how_to/sql_csv#multiple-csvs) section below.

## Pandas

Instead of SQL we can also use data analysis libraries like pandas and the code generating abilities of LLMs to interact with CSV data. Again, **this approach is not fit for production use cases unless you have extensive safeguards in place**. For this reason, our code-execution utilities and constructors live in the `langchain-experimental` package.

### Chain

Most LLMs have been trained on enough pandas Python code that they can generate it just by being asked to:


```python
ai_msg = llm.invoke(
    "I have a pandas DataFrame 'df' with columns 'Age' and 'Fare'. Write code to compute the correlation between the two columns. Return Markdown for a Python code snippet and nothing else."
)
print(ai_msg.content)
```

    ```python
    correlation = df['Age'].corr(df['Fare'])
    correlation
    ```
    

We can combine this ability with a Python-executing tool to create a simple data analysis chain. We'll first want to load our CSV table as a dataframe, and give the tool access to this dataframe:


```python
import pandas as pd
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_experimental.tools import PythonAstREPLTool

df = pd.read_csv("titanic.csv")
tool = PythonAstREPLTool(locals={"df": df})
tool.invoke("df['Fare'].mean()")
```




    32.30542018038331



To help enforce proper use of our Python tool, we'll using [tool calling](/docs/how_to/tool_calling):


```python
llm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools([tool], tool_choice=tool.name)
response = llm_with_tools.invoke(
    "I have a dataframe 'df' and want to know the correlation between the 'Age' and 'Fare' columns"
)
response
```




    AIMessage(content='', additional_kwargs={'tool_calls': [{'id': 'call_SBrK246yUbdnJemXFC8Iod05', 'function': {'arguments': '{"query":"df.corr()[\'Age\'][\'Fare\']"}', 'name': 'python_repl_ast'}, 'type': 'function'}]}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 13, 'prompt_tokens': 125, 'total_tokens': 138}, 'model_name': 'gpt-3.5-turbo', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_3b956da36b', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-1fd332ba-fa72-4351-8182-d464e7368311-0', tool_calls=[{'name': 'python_repl_ast', 'args': {'query': "df.corr()['Age']['Fare']"}, 'id': 'call_SBrK246yUbdnJemXFC8Iod05'}])




```python
response.tool_calls
```




    [{'name': 'python_repl_ast',
      'args': {'query': "df.corr()['Age']['Fare']"},
      'id': 'call_SBrK246yUbdnJemXFC8Iod05'}]



We'll add a tools output parser to extract the function call as a dict:


```python
from langchain_core.output_parsers.openai_tools import JsonOutputKeyToolsParser

parser = JsonOutputKeyToolsParser(key_name=tool.name, first_tool_only=True)
(llm_with_tools | parser).invoke(
    "I have a dataframe 'df' and want to know the correlation between the 'Age' and 'Fare' columns"
)
```




    {'query': "df[['Age', 'Fare']].corr()"}



And combine with a prompt so that we can just specify a question without needing to specify the dataframe info every invocation:


```python
system = f"""You have access to a pandas dataframe `df`. \
Here is the output of `df.head().to_markdown()`:

```
{df.head().to_markdown()}
```

Given a user question, write the Python code to answer it. \
Return ONLY the valid Python code and nothing else. \
Don't assume you have access to any libraries other than built-in Python ones and pandas."""
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([("system", system), ("human", "{question}")])
code_chain = prompt | llm_with_tools | parser
code_chain.invoke({"question": "What's the correlation between age and fare"})
```




    {'query': "df[['Age', 'Fare']].corr()"}



And lastly we'll add our Python tool so that the generated code is actually executed:


```python
chain = prompt | llm_with_tools | parser | tool
chain.invoke({"question": "What's the correlation between age and fare"})
```




    0.11232863699941621



And just like that we have a simple data analysis chain. We can take a peak at the intermediate steps by looking at the LangSmith trace: https://smith.langchain.com/public/b1309290-7212-49b7-bde2-75b39a32b49a/r

We could add an additional LLM call at the end to generate a conversational response, so that we're not just responding with the tool output. For this we'll want to add a chat history `MessagesPlaceholder` to our prompt:


```python
from operator import itemgetter

from langchain_core.messages import ToolMessage
from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser
from langchain_core.prompts import MessagesPlaceholder
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnablePassthrough

system = f"""You have access to a pandas dataframe `df`. \
Here is the output of `df.head().to_markdown()`:

```
{df.head().to_markdown()}
```

Given a user question, write the Python code to answer it. \
Don't assume you have access to any libraries other than built-in Python ones and pandas.
Respond directly to the question once you have enough information to answer it."""
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [
        (
            "system",
            system,
        ),
        ("human", "{question}"),
        # This MessagesPlaceholder allows us to optionally append an arbitrary number of messages
        # at the end of the prompt using the 'chat_history' arg.
        MessagesPlaceholder("chat_history", optional=True),
    ]
)


def _get_chat_history(x: dict) -> list:
    """Parse the chain output up to this point into a list of chat history messages to insert in the prompt."""
    ai_msg = x["ai_msg"]
    tool_call_id = x["ai_msg"].additional_kwargs["tool_calls"][0]["id"]
    tool_msg = ToolMessage(tool_call_id=tool_call_id, content=str(x["tool_output"]))
    return [ai_msg, tool_msg]


chain = (
    RunnablePassthrough.assign(ai_msg=prompt | llm_with_tools)
    .assign(tool_output=itemgetter("ai_msg") | parser | tool)
    .assign(chat_history=_get_chat_history)
    .assign(response=prompt | llm | StrOutputParser())
    .pick(["tool_output", "response"])
)
```


```python
chain.invoke({"question": "What's the correlation between age and fare"})
```




    {'tool_output': 0.11232863699941616,
     'response': 'The correlation between age and fare is approximately 0.1123.'}



Here's the LangSmith trace for this run: https://smith.langchain.com/public/14e38d70-45b1-4b81-8477-9fd2b7c07ea6/r

### Agent

For complex questions it can be helpful for an LLM to be able to iteratively execute code while maintaining the inputs and outputs of its previous executions. This is where Agents come into play. They allow an LLM to decide how many times a tool needs to be invoked and keep track of the executions it's made so far. The [create_pandas_dataframe_agent](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/experimental/agents/langchain_experimental.agents.agent_toolkits.pandas.base.create_pandas_dataframe_agent.html) is a built-in agent that makes it easy to work with dataframes:


```python
from langchain_experimental.agents import create_pandas_dataframe_agent

agent = create_pandas_dataframe_agent(
    llm, df, agent_type="openai-tools", verbose=True, allow_dangerous_code=True
)
agent.invoke(
    {
        "input": "What's the correlation between age and fare? is that greater than the correlation between fare and survival?"
    }
)
```

### Multiple CSVs {#multiple-csvs}

To handle multiple CSVs (or dataframes) we just need to pass multiple dataframes to our Python tool. Our `create_pandas_dataframe_agent` constructor can do this out of the box, we can pass in a list of dataframes instead of just one. If we're constructing a chain ourselves, we can do something like:


```python
df_1 = df[["Age", "Fare"]]
df_2 = df[["Fare", "Survived"]]

tool = PythonAstREPLTool(locals={"df_1": df_1, "df_2": df_2})
llm_with_tool = llm.bind_tools(tools=[tool], tool_choice=tool.name)

### Sandboxed code execution

There are a number of tools like [E2B](/docs/integrations/tools/e2b_data_analysis) and [Bearly](/docs/integrations/tools/bearly) that provide sandboxed environments for Python code execution, to allow for safer code-executing chains and agents.

## Next steps

For more advanced data analysis applications we recommend checking out:

* [SQL tutorial](/docs/tutorials/sql_qa): Many of the challenges of working with SQL db's and CSV's are generic to any structured data type, so it's useful to read the SQL techniques even if you're using Pandas for CSV data analysis.
* [Tool use](/docs/how_to/tool_calling): Guides on general best practices when working with chains and agents that invoke tools
* [Agents](/docs/tutorials/agents): Understand the fundamentals of building LLM agents.
* Integrations: Sandboxed envs like [E2B](/docs/integrations/tools/e2b_data_analysis) and [Bearly](/docs/integrations/tools/bearly), utilities like [SQLDatabase](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/utilities/langchain_community.utilities.sql_database.SQLDatabase.html#langchain_community.utilities.sql_database.SQLDatabase), related agents like [Spark DataFrame agent](/docs/integrations/tools/spark_sql).

# SQLDatabase Toolkit

This will help you getting started with the SQL Database [toolkit](/docs/concepts/tools/#toolkits). For detailed documentation of all `SQLDatabaseToolkit` features and configurations head to the [API reference](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/agent_toolkits/langchain_community.agent_toolkits.sql.toolkit.SQLDatabaseToolkit.html).

Tools within the `SQLDatabaseToolkit` are designed to interact with a `SQL` database. 

A common application is to enable agents to answer questions using data in a relational database, potentially in an iterative fashion (e.g., recovering from errors).

**⚠️ Security note ⚠️**

Building Q&A systems of SQL databases requires executing model-generated SQL queries. There are inherent risks in doing this. Make sure that your database connection permissions are always scoped as narrowly as possible for your chain/agent's needs. This will mitigate though not eliminate the risks of building a model-driven system. For more on general security best practices, [see here](/docs/security).

## Setup

If you want to get automated tracing from runs of individual tools, you can also set your [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) API key by uncommenting below:


```python
# os.environ["LANGSMITH_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("Enter your LangSmith API key: ")
# os.environ["LANGSMITH_TRACING"] = "true"
```

### Installation

This toolkit lives in the `langchain-community` package:


```python
%pip install --upgrade --quiet  langchain-community
```

For demonstration purposes, we will access a prompt in the LangChain [Hub](https://smith.langchain.com/hub). We will also require `langgraph` to demonstrate the use of the toolkit with an agent. This is not required to use the toolkit.


```python
%pip install --upgrade --quiet langchainhub langgraph
```

## Instantiation

The `SQLDatabaseToolkit` toolkit requires:

- a [SQLDatabase](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/utilities/langchain_community.utilities.sql_database.SQLDatabase.html) object;
- a LLM or chat model (for instantiating the [QuerySQLCheckerTool](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/tools/langchain_community.tools.sql_database.tool.QuerySQLCheckerTool.html) tool).

Below, we instantiate the toolkit with these objects. Let's first create a database object.

This guide uses the example `Chinook` database based on [these instructions](https://database.guide/2-sample-databases-sqlite/).

Below we will use the `requests` library to pull the `.sql` file and create an in-memory SQLite database. Note that this approach is lightweight, but ephemeral and not thread-safe. If you'd prefer, you can follow the instructions to save the file locally as `Chinook.db` and instantiate the database via `db = SQLDatabase.from_uri("sqlite:///Chinook.db")`.


```python
import sqlite3

import requests
from langchain_community.utilities.sql_database import SQLDatabase
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.pool import StaticPool


def get_engine_for_chinook_db():
    """Pull sql file, populate in-memory database, and create engine."""
    url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lerocha/chinook-database/master/ChinookDatabase/DataSources/Chinook_Sqlite.sql"
    response = requests.get(url)
    sql_script = response.text

    connection = sqlite3.connect(":memory:", check_same_thread=False)
    connection.executescript(sql_script)
    return create_engine(
        "sqlite://",
        creator=lambda: connection,
        poolclass=StaticPool,
        connect_args={"check_same_thread": False},
    )


engine = get_engine_for_chinook_db()

db = SQLDatabase(engine)
```

We will also need a LLM or chat model:

import ChatModelTabs from "@theme/ChatModelTabs";

<ChatModelTabs customVarName="llm" />



```python
# | output: false
# | echo: false

from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)
```

We can now instantiate the toolkit:


```python
from langchain_community.agent_toolkits.sql.toolkit import SQLDatabaseToolkit

toolkit = SQLDatabaseToolkit(db=db, llm=llm)
```

## Tools

View available tools:


```python
toolkit.get_tools()
```




    [QuerySQLDataBaseTool(description="Input to this tool is a detailed and correct SQL query, output is a result from the database. If the query is not correct, an error message will be returned. If an error is returned, rewrite the query, check the query, and try again. If you encounter an issue with Unknown column 'xxxx' in 'field list', use sql_db_schema to query the correct table fields.", db=<langchain_community.utilities.sql_database.SQLDatabase object at 0x105e02860>),
     InfoSQLDatabaseTool(description='Input to this tool is a comma-separated list of tables, output is the schema and sample rows for those tables.

     ListSQLDatabaseTool(db=<langchain_community.utilities.sql_database.SQLDatabase object at 0x105e02860>),

You can use the individual tools directly:


```python
from langchain_community.tools.sql_database.tool import (
    InfoSQLDatabaseTool,
    ListSQLDatabaseTool,
    QuerySQLCheckerTool,
    QuerySQLDataBaseTool,
)
```

## Use within an agent

Following the [SQL Q&A Tutorial](/docs/tutorials/sql_qa/#agents), below we equip a simple question-answering agent with the tools in our toolkit. First we pull a relevant prompt and populate it with its required parameters:


```python
from langchain import hub

prompt_template = hub.pull("langchain-ai/sql-agent-system-prompt")

assert len(prompt_template.messages) == 1
print(prompt_template.input_variables)
```

    ['dialect', 'top_k']
    


```python
system_message = prompt_template.format(dialect="SQLite", top_k=5)
```

We then instantiate the agent:


```python
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent

agent_executor = create_react_agent(
    llm, toolkit.get_tools(), state_modifier=system_message
)
```

And issue it a query:


```python
example_query = "Which country's customers spent the most?"

events = agent_executor.stream(
    {"messages": [("user", example_query)]},
    stream_mode="values",
)
for event in events:
    event["messages"][-1].pretty_print()
```

## Specific functionality

`SQLDatabaseToolkit` implements a [.get_context](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/agent_toolkits/langchain_community.agent_toolkits.sql.toolkit.SQLDatabaseToolkit.html#langchain_community.agent_toolkits.sql.toolkit.SQLDatabaseToolkit.get_context) method as a convenience for use in prompts or other contexts.

**⚠️ Disclaimer ⚠️** : The agent may generate insert/update/delete queries. When this is not expected, use a custom prompt or create a SQL users without write permissions.

The final user might overload your SQL database by asking a simple question such as "run the biggest query possible". The generated query might look like:

```sql
SELECT * FROM "public"."users"
    JOIN "public"."user_permissions" ON "public"."users".id = "public"."user_permissions".user_id
    JOIN "public"."projects" ON "public"."users".id = "public"."projects".user_id
    JOIN "public"."events" ON "public"."projects".id = "public"."events".project_id;
```

For a transactional SQL database, if one of the table above contains millions of rows, the query might cause trouble to other applications using the same database.

Most datawarehouse oriented databases support user-level quota, for limiting resource usage.

# How to deal with large databases when doing SQL question-answering

In order to write valid queries against a database, we need to feed the model the table names, table schemas, and feature values for it to query over. When there are many tables, columns, and/or high-cardinality columns, it becomes impossible for us to dump the full information about our database in every prompt. Instead, we must find ways to dynamically insert into the prompt only the most relevant information.

In this guide we demonstrate methods for identifying such relevant information, and feeding this into a query-generation step. We will cover:

1. Identifying a relevant subset of tables;
2. Identifying a relevant subset of column values.


## Setup

First, get required packages and set environment variables:


```python
%pip install --upgrade --quiet  langchain langchain-community langchain-openai
```


```python
# Uncomment the below to use LangSmith. Not required.
# import os
# os.environ["LANGCHAIN_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass()
# os.environ["LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2"] = "true"
```

The below example will use a SQLite connection with Chinook database. Follow [these installation steps](https://database.guide/2-sample-databases-sqlite/) to create `Chinook.db` in the same directory as this notebook:

* Save [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lerocha/chinook-database/master/ChinookDatabase/DataSources/Chinook_Sqlite.sql) as `Chinook_Sqlite.sql`
* Run `sqlite3 Chinook.db`
* Run `.read Chinook_Sqlite.sql`
* Test `SELECT * FROM Artist LIMIT 10;`

Now, `Chinhook.db` is in our directory and we can interface with it using the SQLAlchemy-driven [SQLDatabase](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/utilities/langchain_community.utilities.sql_database.SQLDatabase.html) class:


```python
from langchain_community.utilities import SQLDatabase

db = SQLDatabase.from_uri("sqlite:///Chinook.db")
print(db.dialect)
print(db.get_usable_table_names())
print(db.run("SELECT * FROM Artist LIMIT 10;"))
```

    sqlite
    ['Album', 'Artist', 'Customer', 'Employee', 'Genre', 'Invoice', 'InvoiceLine', 'MediaType', 'Playlist', 'PlaylistTrack', 'Track']
    [(1, 'AC/DC'), (2, 'Accept'), (3, 'Aerosmith'), (4, 'Alanis Morissette'), (5, 'Alice In Chains'), (6, 'Antônio Carlos Jobim'), (7, 'Apocalyptica'), (8, 'Audioslave'), (9, 'BackBeat'), (10, 'Billy Cobham')]
    

## Many tables

One of the main pieces of information we need to include in our prompt is the schemas of the relevant tables. When we have very many tables, we can't fit all of the schemas in a single prompt. What we can do in such cases is first extract the names of the tables related to the user input, and then include only their schemas.

One easy and reliable way to do this is using [tool-calling](/docs/how_to/tool_calling). Below, we show how we can use this feature to obtain output conforming to a desired format (in this case, a list of table names). We use the chat model's `.bind_tools` method to bind a tool in Pydantic format, and feed this into an output parser to reconstruct the object from the model's response.

import ChatModelTabs from "@theme/ChatModelTabs";

<ChatModelTabs customVarName="llm" />



```python
# | output: false
# | echo: false

from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI()
```


```python
from langchain_core.output_parsers.openai_tools import PydanticToolsParser
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field


class Table(BaseModel):
    """Table in SQL database."""

    name: str = Field(description="Name of table in SQL database.")


table_names = "\n".join(db.get_usable_table_names())
system = f"""Return the names of ALL the SQL tables that MIGHT be relevant to the user question. \
The tables are:

{table_names}

Remember to include ALL POTENTIALLY RELEVANT tables, even if you're not sure that they're needed."""

prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [
        ("system", system),
        ("human", "{input}"),
    ]
)
llm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools([Table])
output_parser = PydanticToolsParser(tools=[Table])

table_chain = prompt | llm_with_tools | output_parser

table_chain.invoke({"input": "What are all the genres of Alanis Morisette songs"})
```




    [Table(name='Genre')]



This works pretty well! Except, as we'll see below, we actually need a few other tables as well. This would be pretty difficult for the model to know based just on the user question. In this case, we might think to simplify our model's job by grouping the tables together. We'll just ask the model to choose between categories "Music" and "Business", and then take care of selecting all the relevant tables from there:


```python
system = """Return the names of any SQL tables that are relevant to the user question.
The tables are:

Music
Business
"""

prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [
        ("system", system),
        ("human", "{input}"),
    ]
)

category_chain = prompt | llm_with_tools | output_parser
category_chain.invoke({"input": "What are all the genres of Alanis Morisette songs"})
```




    [Table(name='Music'), Table(name='Business')]




```python
from typing import List


def get_tables(categories: List[Table]) -> List[str]:
    tables = []
    for category in categories:
        if category.name == "Music":
            tables.extend(
                [
                    "Album",
                    "Artist",
                    "Genre",
                    "MediaType",
                    "Playlist",
                    "PlaylistTrack",
                    "Track",
                ]
            )
        elif category.name == "Business":
            tables.extend(["Customer", "Employee", "Invoice", "InvoiceLine"])
    return tables


table_chain = category_chain | get_tables
table_chain.invoke({"input": "What are all the genres of Alanis Morisette songs"})
```




    ['Album',
     'Artist',
     'Genre',
     'MediaType',
     'Playlist',
     'PlaylistTrack',
     'Track',
     'Customer',
     'Employee',
     'Invoice',
     'InvoiceLine']



Now that we've got a chain that can output the relevant tables for any query we can combine this with our [create_sql_query_chain](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/langchain/chains/langchain.chains.sql_database.query.create_sql_query_chain.html), which can accept a list of `table_names_to_use` to determine which table schemas are included in the prompt:


```python
from operator import itemgetter

from langchain.chains import create_sql_query_chain
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnablePassthrough

query_chain = create_sql_query_chain(llm, db)
# Convert "question" key to the "input" key expected by current table_chain.
table_chain = {"input": itemgetter("question")} | table_chain
# Set table_names_to_use using table_chain.
full_chain = RunnablePassthrough.assign(table_names_to_use=table_chain) | query_chain
```


```python
query = full_chain.invoke(
    {"question": "What are all the genres of Alanis Morisette songs"}
)
print(query)
```

    SELECT DISTINCT "g"."Name"
    FROM "Genre" g
    JOIN "Track" t ON "g"."GenreId" = "t"."GenreId"
    JOIN "Album" a ON "t"."AlbumId" = "a"."AlbumId"
    JOIN "Artist" ar ON "a"."ArtistId" = "ar"."ArtistId"
    WHERE "ar"."Name" = 'Alanis Morissette'
    LIMIT 5;
    


```python
db.run(query)
```




    "[('Rock',)]"



We can see the LangSmith trace for this run [here](https://smith.langchain.com/public/4fbad408-3554-4f33-ab47-1e510a1b52a3/r).

We've seen how to dynamically include a subset of table schemas in a prompt within a chain. Another possible approach to this problem is to let an Agent decide for itself when to look up tables by giving it a Tool to do so. You can see an example of this in the [SQL: Agents](/docs/tutorials/agents) guide.

## High-cardinality columns

In order to filter columns that contain proper nouns such as addresses, song names or artists, we first need to double-check the spelling in order to filter the data correctly. 

One naive strategy it to create a vector store with all the distinct proper nouns that exist in the database. We can then query that vector store each user input and inject the most relevant proper nouns into the prompt.

First we need the unique values for each entity we want, for which we define a function that parses the result into a list of elements:


```python
import ast
import re


def query_as_list(db, query):
    res = db.run(query)
    res = [el for sub in ast.literal_eval(res) for el in sub if el]
    res = [re.sub(r"\b\d+\b", "", string).strip() for string in res]
    return res


proper_nouns = query_as_list(db, "SELECT Name FROM Artist")
proper_nouns += query_as_list(db, "SELECT Title FROM Album")
proper_nouns += query_as_list(db, "SELECT Name FROM Genre")
len(proper_nouns)
proper_nouns[:5]
```




    ['AC/DC', 'Accept', 'Aerosmith', 'Alanis Morissette', 'Alice In Chains']



Now we can embed and store all of our values in a vector database:


```python
from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings

vector_db = FAISS.from_texts(proper_nouns, OpenAIEmbeddings())
retriever = vector_db.as_retriever(search_kwargs={"k": 15})
```

And put together a query construction chain that first retrieves values from the database and inserts them into the prompt:


```python
from operator import itemgetter

from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnablePassthrough

system = """You are a SQLite expert. Given an input question, create a syntactically
correct SQLite query to run. Unless otherwise specificed, do not return more than
{top_k} rows.

Only return the SQL query with no markup or explanation.

Here is the relevant table info: {table_info}

Here is a non-exhaustive list of possible feature values. If filtering on a feature
value make sure to check its spelling against this list first:

{proper_nouns}
"""

prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([("system", system), ("human", "{input}")])

query_chain = create_sql_query_chain(llm, db, prompt=prompt)
retriever_chain = (
    itemgetter("question")
    | retriever
    | (lambda docs: "\n".join(doc.page_content for doc in docs))
)
chain = RunnablePassthrough.assign(proper_nouns=retriever_chain) | query_chain
```

To try out our chain, let's see what happens when we try filtering on "elenis moriset", a misspelling of Alanis Morissette, without and with retrieval:


```python
# Without retrieval
query = query_chain.invoke(
    {"question": "What are all the genres of elenis moriset songs", "proper_nouns": ""}
)
print(query)
db.run(query)
```

    SELECT DISTINCT g.Name 
    FROM Track t
    JOIN Album a ON t.AlbumId = a.AlbumId
    JOIN Artist ar ON a.ArtistId = ar.ArtistId
    JOIN Genre g ON t.GenreId = g.GenreId
    WHERE ar.Name = 'Elenis Moriset';
    




    ''




```python
# Without retrieval
query = query_chain.invoke(
    {"question": "What are all the genres of elenis moriset songs", "proper_nouns": ""}
)
print(query)
db.run(query)
```

    SELECT DISTINCT Genre.Name
    FROM Genre
    JOIN Track ON Genre.GenreId = Track.GenreId
    JOIN Album ON Track.AlbumId = Album.AlbumId
    JOIN Artist ON Album.ArtistId = Artist.ArtistId
    WHERE Artist.Name = 'Elenis Moriset'
    




    ''




```python
# With retrieval
query = chain.invoke({"question": "What are all the genres of elenis moriset songs"})
print(query)
db.run(query)
```

    SELECT DISTINCT g.Name
    FROM Genre g
    JOIN Track t ON g.GenreId = t.GenreId
    JOIN Album a ON t.AlbumId = a.AlbumId
    JOIN Artist ar ON a.ArtistId = ar.ArtistId
    WHERE ar.Name = 'Alanis Morissette';
    




    "[('Rock',)]"



We can see that with retrieval we're able to correct the spelling from "Elenis Moriset" to "Alanis Morissette" and get back a valid result.

Another possible approach to this problem is to let an Agent decide for itself when to look up proper nouns. You can see an example of this in the [SQL: Agents](/docs/tutorials/agents) guide.

# How to better prompt when doing SQL question-answering

In this guide we'll go over prompting strategies to improve SQL query generation using [create_sql_query_chain](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/langchain/chains/langchain.chains.sql_database.query.create_sql_query_chain.html). We'll largely focus on methods for getting relevant database-specific information in your prompt.

We will cover: 

- How the dialect of the LangChain [SQLDatabase](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/utilities/langchain_community.utilities.sql_database.SQLDatabase.html) impacts the prompt of the chain;
- How to format schema information into the prompt using `SQLDatabase.get_context`;
- How to build and select few-shot examples to assist the model.

## Setup

First, get required packages and set environment variables:


```python
%pip install --upgrade --quiet  langchain langchain-community langchain-experimental langchain-openai
```


```python
# Uncomment the below to use LangSmith. Not required.
# import os
# os.environ["LANGCHAIN_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass()
# os.environ["LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2"] = "true"
```

The below example will use a SQLite connection with Chinook database. Follow [these installation steps](https://database.guide/2-sample-databases-sqlite/) to create `Chinook.db` in the same directory as this notebook:

* Save [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lerocha/chinook-database/master/ChinookDatabase/DataSources/Chinook_Sqlite.sql) as `Chinook_Sqlite.sql`
* Run `sqlite3 Chinook.db`
* Run `.read Chinook_Sqlite.sql`
* Test `SELECT * FROM Artist LIMIT 10;`

Now, `Chinhook.db` is in our directory and we can interface with it using the SQLAlchemy-driven `SQLDatabase` class:


```python
from langchain_community.utilities import SQLDatabase

db = SQLDatabase.from_uri("sqlite:///Chinook.db", sample_rows_in_table_info=3)
print(db.dialect)
print(db.get_usable_table_names())
print(db.run("SELECT * FROM Artist LIMIT 10;"))
```

    sqlite
    ['Album', 'Artist', 'Customer', 'Employee', 'Genre', 'Invoice', 'InvoiceLine', 'MediaType', 'Playlist', 'PlaylistTrack', 'Track']
    [(1, 'AC/DC'), (2, 'Accept'), (3, 'Aerosmith'), (4, 'Alanis Morissette'), (5, 'Alice In Chains'), (6, 'Antônio Carlos Jobim'), (7, 'Apocalyptica'), (8, 'Audioslave'), (9, 'BackBeat'), (10, 'Billy Cobham')]
    

## Dialect-specific prompting

One of the simplest things we can do is make our prompt specific to the SQL dialect we're using. When using the built-in [create_sql_query_chain](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/langchain/chains/langchain.chains.sql_database.query.create_sql_query_chain.html) and [SQLDatabase](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/utilities/langchain_community.utilities.sql_database.SQLDatabase.html), this is handled for you for any of the following dialects:


```python
from langchain.chains.sql_database.prompt import SQL_PROMPTS

list(SQL_PROMPTS)
```




    ['crate',
     'duckdb',
     'googlesql',
     'mssql',
     'mysql',
     'mariadb',
     'oracle',
     'postgresql',
     'sqlite',
     'clickhouse',
     'prestodb']



For example, using our current DB we can see that we'll get a SQLite-specific prompt.

import ChatModelTabs from "@theme/ChatModelTabs";

<ChatModelTabs customVarName="llm" />



```python
# | output: false
# | echo: false

from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI()
```


```python
from langchain.chains import create_sql_query_chain

chain = create_sql_query_chain(llm, db)
chain.get_prompts()[0].pretty_print()
```

    You are a SQLite expert. Given an input question, first create a syntactically correct SQLite query to run, then look at the results of the query and return the answer to the input question.
    Unless the user specifies in the question a specific number of examples to obtain, query for at most 5 results using the LIMIT clause as per SQLite. You can order the results to return the most informative data in the database.
    Never query for all columns from a table. You must query only the columns that are needed to answer the question. Wrap each column name in double quotes (") to denote them as delimited identifiers.
    Pay attention to use only the column names you can see in the tables below. Be careful to not query for columns that do not exist. Also, pay attention to which column is in which table.
    Pay attention to use date('now') function to get the current date, if the question involves "today".
    
    Use the following format:
    
    Question: Question here
    SQLQuery: SQL Query to run
    SQLResult: Result of the SQLQuery
    Answer: Final answer here
    
    Only use the following tables:
    [33;1m[1;3m{table_info}[0m
    
    Question: [33;1m[1;3m{input}[0m
    

## Table definitions and example rows

In most SQL chains, we'll need to feed the model at least part of the database schema. Without this it won't be able to write valid queries. Our database comes with some convenience methods to give us the relevant context. Specifically, we can get the table names, their schemas, and a sample of rows from each table.

Here we will use `SQLDatabase.get_context`, which provides available tables and their schemas:


```python
context = db.get_context()
print(list(context))
print(context["table_info"])
```

    ['table_info', 'table_names']

When we don't have too many, or too wide of, tables, we can just insert the entirety of this information in our prompt:


```python
prompt_with_context = chain.get_prompts()[0].partial(table_info=context["table_info"])
print(prompt_with_context.pretty_repr()[:1500])
```

    You are a SQLite expert. Given an input question, first create a syntactically correct SQLite query to run, then look at the results of the query and return the answer to the input question.
    Unless the user specifies in the question a specific number of examples to obtain, query for at most 5 results using the LIMIT clause as per SQLite. You can order the results to return the most informative data in the database.
    Never query for all columns from a table. You must query only the columns that are needed to answer the question. Wrap each column name in double quotes (") to denote them as delimited identifiers.
    Pay attention to use only the column names you can see in the tables below. Be careful to not query for columns that do not exist. Also, pay attention to which column is in which table.
    Pay attention to use date('now') function to get the current date, if the question involves "today".
    
    Use the following format:
    
    Question: Question here
    SQLQuery: SQL Query to run
    SQLResult: Result of the SQLQuery
    Answer: Final answer here
    
    Only use the following tables:
    
    CREATE TABLE "Album" (
    	"AlbumId" INTEGER NOT NULL, 
    	"Title" NVARCHAR(160) NOT NULL, 
    	"ArtistId" INTEGER NOT NULL, 
    	PRIMARY KEY ("AlbumId"), 
    	FOREIGN KEY("ArtistId") REFERENCES "Artist" ("ArtistId")
    )
    
    /*
    3 rows from Album table:
    AlbumId	Title	ArtistId
    1	For Those About To Rock We Salute You	1
    2	Balls to the Wall	2
    3	Restless and Wild	2
    */
    
    
    CREATE TABLE "Artist" (
    	"ArtistId" INTEGER NOT NULL, 
    	"Name" NVARCHAR(120)
    

When we do have database schemas that are too large to fit into our model's context window, we'll need to come up with ways of inserting only the relevant table definitions into the prompt based on the user input. For more on this head to the [Many tables, wide tables, high-cardinality feature](/docs/how_to/sql_large_db) guide.

## Few-shot examples

Including examples of natural language questions being converted to valid SQL queries against our database in the prompt will often improve model performance, especially for complex queries.

Let's say we have the following examples:


```python
examples = [
    {"input": "List all artists.", "query": "SELECT * FROM Artist;"},
    {
        "input": "Find all albums for the artist 'AC/DC'.",
        "query": "SELECT * FROM Album WHERE ArtistId = (SELECT ArtistId FROM Artist WHERE Name = 'AC/DC');",
    },
    {
        "input": "List all tracks in the 'Rock' genre.",
        "query": "SELECT * FROM Track WHERE GenreId = (SELECT GenreId FROM Genre WHERE Name = 'Rock');",
    },
    {
        "input": "Find the total duration of all tracks.",
        "query": "SELECT SUM(Milliseconds) FROM Track;",
    },
    {
        "input": "List all customers from Canada.",
        "query": "SELECT * FROM Customer WHERE Country = 'Canada';",
    },
    {
        "input": "How many tracks are there in the album with ID 5?",
        "query": "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Track WHERE AlbumId = 5;",
    },
    {
        "input": "Find the total number of invoices.",
        "query": "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Invoice;",
    },
    {
        "input": "List all tracks that are longer than 5 minutes.",
        "query": "SELECT * FROM Track WHERE Milliseconds > 300000;",
    },
    {
        "input": "Who are the top 5 customers by total purchase?",
        "query": "SELECT CustomerId, SUM(Total) AS TotalPurchase FROM Invoice GROUP BY CustomerId ORDER BY TotalPurchase DESC LIMIT 5;",
    },
    {
        "input": "Which albums are from the year 2000?",
        "query": "SELECT * FROM Album WHERE strftime('%Y', ReleaseDate) = '2000';",
    },
    {
        "input": "How many employees are there",
        "query": 'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "Employee"',
    },
]
```

We can create a few-shot prompt with them like so:


```python
from langchain_core.prompts import FewShotPromptTemplate, PromptTemplate

example_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template("User input: {input}\nSQL query: {query}")
prompt = FewShotPromptTemplate(
    examples=examples[:5],
    example_prompt=example_prompt,
    prefix="You are a SQLite expert. Given an input question, create a syntactically correct SQLite query to run. Unless otherwise specificed, do not return more than {top_k} rows.\n\nHere is the relevant table info: {table_info}\n\nBelow are a number of examples of questions and their corresponding SQL queries.",
    suffix="User input: {input}\nSQL query: ",
    input_variables=["input", "top_k", "table_info"],
)
```


```python
print(prompt.format(input="How many artists are there?", top_k=3, table_info="foo"))
```

    You are a SQLite expert. Given an input question, create a syntactically correct SQLite query to run. Unless otherwise specificed, do not return more than 3 rows.
    
    Here is the relevant table info: foo
    
    Below are a number of examples of questions and their corresponding SQL queries.
    
    User input: List all artists.
    SQL query: SELECT * FROM Artist;
    
    User input: Find all albums for the artist 'AC/DC'.
    SQL query: SELECT * FROM Album WHERE ArtistId = (SELECT ArtistId FROM Artist WHERE Name = 'AC/DC');
    
    User input: List all tracks in the 'Rock' genre.
    SQL query: SELECT * FROM Track WHERE GenreId = (SELECT GenreId FROM Genre WHERE Name = 'Rock');
    
    User input: Find the total duration of all tracks.
    SQL query: SELECT SUM(Milliseconds) FROM Track;
    
    User input: List all customers from Canada.
    SQL query: SELECT * FROM Customer WHERE Country = 'Canada';
    
    User input: How many artists are there?
    SQL query: 
    

## Dynamic few-shot examples

If we have enough examples, we may want to only include the most relevant ones in the prompt, either because they don't fit in the model's context window or because the long tail of examples distracts the model. And specifically, given any input we want to include the examples most relevant to that input.

We can do just this using an ExampleSelector. In this case we'll use a [SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/core/example_selectors/langchain_core.example_selectors.semantic_similarity.SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector.html), which will store the examples in the vector database of our choosing. At runtime it will perform a similarity search between the input and our examples, and return the most semantically similar ones.

We default to OpenAI embeddings here, but you can swap them out for the model provider of your choice.


```python
from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain_core.example_selectors import SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings

example_selector = SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector.from_examples(
    examples,
    OpenAIEmbeddings(),
    FAISS,
    k=5,
    input_keys=["input"],
)
```


```python
example_selector.select_examples({"input": "how many artists are there?"})
```




    [{'input': 'List all artists.', 'query': 'SELECT * FROM Artist;'},
     {'input': 'How many employees are there',
      'query': 'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "Employee"'},
     {'input': 'How many tracks are there in the album with ID 5?',
      'query': 'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Track WHERE AlbumId = 5;'},
     {'input': 'Which albums are from the year 2000?',
      'query': "SELECT * FROM Album WHERE strftime('%Y', ReleaseDate) = '2000';"},
     {'input': "List all tracks in the 'Rock' genre.",
      'query': "SELECT * FROM Track WHERE GenreId = (SELECT GenreId FROM Genre WHERE Name = 'Rock');"}]



To use it, we can pass the ExampleSelector directly in to our FewShotPromptTemplate:


```python
prompt = FewShotPromptTemplate(
    example_selector=example_selector,
    example_prompt=example_prompt,
    prefix="You are a SQLite expert. Given an input question, create a syntactically correct SQLite query to run. Unless otherwise specificed, do not return more than {top_k} rows.\n\nHere is the relevant table info: {table_info}\n\nBelow are a number of examples of questions and their corresponding SQL queries.",
    suffix="User input: {input}\nSQL query: ",
    input_variables=["input", "top_k", "table_info"],
)
```


```python
print(prompt.format(input="how many artists are there?", top_k=3, table_info="foo"))
```

    You are a SQLite expert. Given an input question, create a syntactically correct SQLite query to run. Unless otherwise specificed, do not return more than 3 rows.
    
    Here is the relevant table info: foo
    
    Below are a number of examples of questions and their corresponding SQL queries.
    
    User input: List all artists.
    SQL query: SELECT * FROM Artist;
    
    User input: How many employees are there
    SQL query: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "Employee"
    
    User input: How many tracks are there in the album with ID 5?
    SQL query: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Track WHERE AlbumId = 5;
    
    User input: Which albums are from the year 2000?
    SQL query: SELECT * FROM Album WHERE strftime('%Y', ReleaseDate) = '2000';
    
    User input: List all tracks in the 'Rock' genre.
    SQL query: SELECT * FROM Track WHERE GenreId = (SELECT GenreId FROM Genre WHERE Name = 'Rock');
    
    User input: how many artists are there?
    SQL query: 
    

Trying it out, we see that the model identifies the relevant table:


```python
chain = create_sql_query_chain(llm, db, prompt)
chain.invoke({"question": "how many artists are there?"})
```




    'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Artist;'

# Build a Question/Answering system over SQL data

:::info Prerequisites

This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:

- [Chaining runnables](/docs/how_to/sequence/)
- [Chat models](/docs/concepts/chat_models)
- [Tools](/docs/concepts/tools)
- [Agents](/docs/concepts/agents)

:::

Enabling a LLM system to query structured data can be qualitatively different from unstructured text data. Whereas in the latter it is common to generate text that can be searched against a vector database, the approach for structured data is often for the LLM to write and execute queries in a DSL, such as SQL. In this guide we'll go over the basic ways to create a Q&A system over tabular data in databases. We will cover implementations using both chains and agents. These systems will allow us to ask a question about the data in a database and get back a natural language answer. The main difference between the two is that our agent can query the database in a loop as many times as it needs to answer the question.

## ⚠️ Security note ⚠️

Building Q&A systems of SQL databases requires executing model-generated SQL queries. There are inherent risks in doing this. Make sure that your database connection permissions are always scoped as narrowly as possible for your chain/agent's needs. This will mitigate though not eliminate the risks of building a model-driven system. For more on general security best practices, [see here](/docs/security).


## Architecture

At a high-level, the steps of these systems are:

1. **Convert question to SQL query**: Model converts user input to a SQL query.
2. **Execute SQL query**: Execute the query.
3. **Answer the question**: Model responds to user input using the query results.

Note that querying data in CSVs can follow a similar approach. See our [how-to guide](/docs/how_to/sql_csv) on question-answering over CSV data for more detail.

![sql_usecase.png](../../static/img/sql_usecase.png)

## Setup

First, get required packages and set environment variables:


```python
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install --upgrade --quiet langchain langchain-community langchain-openai faiss-cpu
```

We will use an OpenAI model and a [FAISS-powered vector store](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/faiss/) in this guide.


```python
import getpass
import os

if not os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY"):
    os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass()
```

```python
# Comment out the below to opt-out of using LangSmith in this notebook. Not required.
if not os.environ.get("LANGCHAIN_API_KEY"):
    os.environ["LANGCHAIN_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass()
    os.environ["LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2"] = "true"
```

The below example will use a SQLite connection with Chinook database. Follow [these installation steps](https://database.guide/2-sample-databases-sqlite/) to create `Chinook.db` in the same directory as this notebook:

* Save [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lerocha/chinook-database/master/ChinookDatabase/DataSources/Chinook_Sqlite.sql) as `Chinook.sql`
* Run `sqlite3 Chinook.db`
* Run `.read Chinook.sql`
* Test `SELECT * FROM Artist LIMIT 10;`

Now, `Chinook.db` is in our directory and we can interface with it using the SQLAlchemy-driven `SQLDatabase` class:


```python
from langchain_community.utilities import SQLDatabase

db = SQLDatabase.from_uri("sqlite:///Chinook.db")
print(db.dialect)
print(db.get_usable_table_names())
db.run("SELECT * FROM Artist LIMIT 10;")
```

    sqlite
    ['Album', 'Artist', 'Customer', 'Employee', 'Genre', 'Invoice', 'InvoiceLine', 'MediaType', 'Playlist', 'PlaylistTrack', 'Track']
    




    "[(1, 'AC/DC'), (2, 'Accept'), (3, 'Aerosmith'), (4, 'Alanis Morissette'), (5, 'Alice In Chains'), (6, 'Antônio Carlos Jobim'), (7, 'Apocalyptica'), (8, 'Audioslave'), (9, 'BackBeat'), (10, 'Billy Cobham')]"



Great! We've got a SQL database that we can query. Now let's try hooking it up to an LLM.

## Chains {#chains}

Chains (i.e., compositions of LangChain [Runnables](/docs/concepts/lcel)) support applications whose steps are predictable. We can create a simple chain that takes a question and does the following:
- convert the question into a SQL query;
- execute the query;
- use the result to answer the original question.

There are scenarios not supported by this arrangement. For example, this system will execute a SQL query for any user input-- even "hello". Importantly, as we'll see below, some questions require more than one query to answer. We will address these scenarios in the Agents section.

### Convert question to SQL query

The first step in a SQL chain or agent is to take the user input and convert it to a SQL query. LangChain comes with a built-in chain for this: [create_sql_query_chain](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/langchain/chains/langchain.chains.sql_database.query.create_sql_query_chain.html).

import ChatModelTabs from "@theme/ChatModelTabs";

<ChatModelTabs customVarName="llm" />



```python
# | output: false
# | echo: false

from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", temperature=0)
```


```python
from langchain.chains import create_sql_query_chain

chain = create_sql_query_chain(llm, db)
response = chain.invoke({"question": "How many employees are there"})
response
```




    'SELECT COUNT("EmployeeId") AS "TotalEmployees" FROM "Employee"\nLIMIT 1;'



We can execute the query to make sure it's valid:


```python
db.run(response)
```




    '[(8,)]'



We can look at the [LangSmith trace](https://smith.langchain.com/public/c8fa52ea-be46-4829-bde2-52894970b830/r) to get a better understanding of what this chain is doing. We can also inspect the chain directly for its prompts. Looking at the prompt (below), we can see that it is:

* Dialect-specific. In this case it references SQLite explicitly.
* Has definitions for all the available tables.
* Has three examples rows for each table.

This technique is inspired by papers like [this](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.00498.pdf), which suggest showing examples rows and being explicit about tables improves performance. We can also inspect the full prompt like so:


```python
chain.get_prompts()[0].pretty_print()
```

    You are a SQLite expert. Given an input question, first create a syntactically correct SQLite query to run, then look at the results of the query and return the answer to the input question.
    Unless the user specifies in the question a specific number of examples to obtain, query for at most 5 results using the LIMIT clause as per SQLite. You can order the results to return the most informative data in the database.
    Never query for all columns from a table. You must query only the columns that are needed to answer the question. Wrap each column name in double quotes (") to denote them as delimited identifiers.
    Pay attention to use only the column names you can see in the tables below. Be careful to not query for columns that do not exist. Also, pay attention to which column is in which table.
    Pay attention to use date('now') function to get the current date, if the question involves "today".
    
    Use the following format:
    
    Question: Question here
    SQLQuery: SQL Query to run
    SQLResult: Result of the SQLQuery
    Answer: Final answer here
    
    Only use the following tables:
    [33;1m[1;3m{table_info}[0m
    
    Question: [33;1m[1;3m{input}[0m
    

### Execute SQL query

Now that we've generated a SQL query, we'll want to execute it. **This is the most dangerous part of creating a SQL chain.** Consider carefully if it is OK to run automated queries over your data. Minimize the database connection permissions as much as possible. Consider adding a human approval step to you chains before query execution (see below).

We can use the `QuerySQLDatabaseTool` to easily add query execution to our chain:


```python
from langchain_community.tools.sql_database.tool import QuerySQLDataBaseTool

execute_query = QuerySQLDataBaseTool(db=db)
write_query = create_sql_query_chain(llm, db)
chain = write_query | execute_query
chain.invoke({"question": "How many employees are there"})
```




    '[(8,)]'



### Answer the question

Now that we've got a way to automatically generate and execute queries, we just need to combine the original question and SQL query result to generate a final answer. We can do this by passing question and result to the LLM once more:


```python
from operator import itemgetter

from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser
from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnablePassthrough

answer_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(
    """Given the following user question, corresponding SQL query, and SQL result, answer the user question.

Question: {question}
SQL Query: {query}
SQL Result: {result}
Answer: """
)

chain = (
    RunnablePassthrough.assign(query=write_query).assign(
        result=itemgetter("query") | execute_query
    )
    | answer_prompt
    | llm
    | StrOutputParser()
)

chain.invoke({"question": "How many employees are there"})
```




    'There are a total of 8 employees.'



Let's review what is happening in the above LCEL. Suppose this chain is invoked.
- After the first `RunnablePassthrough.assign`, we have a runnable with two elements:  
  `{"question": question, "query": write_query.invoke(question)}`  
  Where `write_query` will generate a SQL query in service of answering the question.
- After the second `RunnablePassthrough.assign`, we have add a third element `"result"` that contains `execute_query.invoke(query)`, where `query` was computed in the previous step.
- These three inputs are formatted into the prompt and passed into the LLM.
- The `StrOutputParser()` plucks out the string content of the output message.

Note that we are composing LLMs, tools, prompts, and other chains together, but because each implements the Runnable interface, their inputs and outputs can be tied together in a reasonable way.

### Next steps

For more complex query-generation, we may want to create few-shot prompts or add query-checking steps. For advanced techniques like this and more check out:

* [Prompting strategies](/docs/how_to/sql_prompting): Advanced prompt engineering techniques.
* [Query checking](/docs/how_to/sql_query_checking): Add query validation and error handling.
* [Large databases](/docs/how_to/sql_large_db): Techniques for working with large databases.

## Agents {#agents}

LangChain has a SQL Agent which provides a more flexible way of interacting with SQL Databases than a chain. The main advantages of using the SQL Agent are:

- It can answer questions based on the databases' schema as well as on the databases' content (like describing a specific table).
- It can recover from errors by running a generated query, catching the traceback and regenerating it correctly.
- It can query the database as many times as needed to answer the user question.
- It will save tokens by only retrieving the schema from relevant tables.

To initialize the agent we'll use the `SQLDatabaseToolkit` to create a bunch of tools:

* Create and execute queries
* Check query syntax
* Retrieve table descriptions
* ... and more


```python
from langchain_community.agent_toolkits import SQLDatabaseToolkit

toolkit = SQLDatabaseToolkit(db=db, llm=llm)

tools = toolkit.get_tools()

tools
```




    [QuerySQLDataBaseTool(description="Input to this tool is a detailed and correct SQL query, output is a result from the database. If the query is not correct, an error message will be returned. If an error is returned, rewrite the query, check the query, and try again.

### System Prompt

We will also want to create a system prompt for our agent. This will consist of instructions for how to behave.


```python
from langchain_core.messages import SystemMessage

SQL_PREFIX = """You are an agent designed to interact with a SQL database.
Given an input question, create a syntactically correct SQLite query to run, then look at the results of the query and return the answer.
Unless the user specifies a specific number of examples they wish to obtain, always limit your query to at most 5 results.
You can order the results by a relevant column to return the most interesting examples in the database.
Never query for all the columns from a specific table, only ask for the relevant columns given the question.
You have access to tools for interacting with the database.
Only use the below tools. Only use the information returned by the below tools to construct your final answer.
You MUST double check your query before executing it. If you get an error while executing a query, rewrite the query and try again.

DO NOT make any DML statements (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DROP etc.) to the database.

To start you should ALWAYS look at the tables in the database to see what you can query.
Do NOT skip this step.
Then you should query the schema of the most relevant tables."""

system_message = SystemMessage(content=SQL_PREFIX)
```

### Initializing agent
First, get required package **LangGraph**


```python
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install --upgrade --quiet langgraph
```

We will use a prebuilt [LangGraph](/docs/concepts/architecture/#langgraph) agent to build our agent


```python
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent

agent_executor = create_react_agent(llm, tools, messages_modifier=system_message)
```

Consider how the agent responds to the below question:


```python
for s in agent_executor.stream(
    {"messages": [HumanMessage(content="Which country's customers spent the most?")]}
):
    print(s)
    print("----")
```

    {'action': {'messages': [ToolMessage(content="[('USA', 523.0600000000003)]", name='sql_db_query', id='f647e606-8362-40ab-8d34-612ff166dbe1', tool_call_id='call_22Asbqgdx26YyEvJxBuANVdY')]}}
    ----
    {'agent': {'messages': [AIMessage(content='Customers from the USA spent the most, with a total amount spent of $523.06.', response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 20, 'prompt_tokens': 819, 'total_tokens': 839}, 'model_name': 'gpt-3.5-turbo', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_3b956da36b', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-92e88de0-ff62-41da-8181-053fb5632af4-0')]}}
    ----
    

Note that the agent executes multiple queries until it has the information it needs:
1. List available tables;
2. Retrieves the schema for three tables;
3. Queries multiple of the tables via a join operation.

The agent is then able to use the result of the final query to generate an answer to the original question.

The agent can similarly handle qualitative questions:


```python
for s in agent_executor.stream(
    {"messages": [HumanMessage(content="Describe the playlisttrack table")]}
):
    print(s)
    print("----")

### Dealing with high-cardinality columns

In order to filter columns that contain proper nouns such as addresses, song names or artists, we first need to double-check the spelling in order to filter the data correctly. 

We can achieve this by creating a vector store with all the distinct proper nouns that exist in the database. We can then have the agent query that vector store each time the user includes a proper noun in their question, to find the correct spelling for that word. In this way, the agent can make sure it understands which entity the user is referring to before building the target query.

First we need the unique values for each entity we want, for which we define a function that parses the result into a list of elements:


```python
import ast
import re


def query_as_list(db, query):
    res = db.run(query)
    res = [el for sub in ast.literal_eval(res) for el in sub if el]
    res = [re.sub(r"\b\d+\b", "", string).strip() for string in res]
    return list(set(res))


artists = query_as_list(db, "SELECT Name FROM Artist")
albums = query_as_list(db, "SELECT Title FROM Album")
albums[:5]
```




    ['Big Ones',
     'Cidade Negra - Hits',
     'In Step',
     'Use Your Illusion I',
     'Voodoo Lounge']



Using this function, we can create a **retriever tool** that the agent can execute at its discretion.


```python
from langchain.agents.agent_toolkits import create_retriever_tool
from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings

vector_db = FAISS.from_texts(artists + albums, OpenAIEmbeddings())
retriever = vector_db.as_retriever(search_kwargs={"k": 5})
description = """Use to look up values to filter on. Input is an approximate spelling of the proper noun, output is \
valid proper nouns. Use the noun most similar to the search."""
retriever_tool = create_retriever_tool(
    retriever,
    name="search_proper_nouns",
    description=description,
)
```

Let's try it out:


```python
print(retriever_tool.invoke("Alice Chains"))
```

    Alice In Chains
    
    Alanis Morissette
    
    Pearl Jam
    
    Pearl Jam
    
    Audioslave
    

This way, if the agent determines it needs to write a filter based on an artist along the lines of "Alice Chains", it can first use the retriever tool to observe relevant values of a column.

Putting this together:


```python
system = """You are an agent designed to interact with a SQL database.
Given an input question, create a syntactically correct SQLite query to run, then look at the results of the query and return the answer.
Unless the user specifies a specific number of examples they wish to obtain, always limit your query to at most 5 results.
You can order the results by a relevant column to return the most interesting examples in the database.
Never query for all the columns from a specific table, only ask for the relevant columns given the question.
You have access to tools for interacting with the database.
Only use the given tools. Only use the information returned by the tools to construct your final answer.
You MUST double check your query before executing it. If you get an error while executing a query, rewrite the query and try again.

DO NOT make any DML statements (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DROP etc.) to the database.

You have access to the following tables: {table_names}

If you need to filter on a proper noun, you must ALWAYS first look up the filter value using the "search_proper_nouns" tool!
Do not try to guess at the proper name - use this function to find similar ones.""".format(
    table_names=db.get_usable_table_names()
)

system_message = SystemMessage(content=system)

tools.append(retriever_tool)

agent = create_react_agent(llm, tools, messages_modifier=system_message)
```


```python
for s in agent.stream(
    {"messages": [HumanMessage(content="How many albums does alis in chain have?")]}
):
    print(s)
    print("----")
```

    {'agent': {'messages': [AIMessage(content='', additional_kwargs={'tool_calls': [{'id': 'call_r5UlSwHKQcWDHx6LrttnqE56', 'function': {'arguments': '{"query":"SELECT COUNT(*) AS album_count FROM Album WHERE ArtistId IN (SELECT ArtistId FROM Artist WHERE Name = \'Alice In Chains\')"}', 'name': 'sql_db_query'}, 'type': 'function'}]}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 40, 'prompt_tokens': 612, 'total_tokens': 652}, 'model_name': 'gpt-3.5-turbo', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_3b956da36b', 'finish_reason': 'tool_calls', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-548353fd-b06c-45bf-beab-46f81eb434df-0', tool_calls=[{'name': 'sql_db_query', 'args': {'query': "SELECT COUNT(*) AS album_count FROM Album WHERE ArtistId IN (SELECT ArtistId FROM Artist WHERE Name = 'Alice In Chains')"}, 'id': 'call_r5UlSwHKQcWDHx6LrttnqE56'}])]}}
    ----
    {'action': {'messages': [ToolMessage(content='[(1,)]', name='sql_db_query', id='093058a9-f013-4be1-8e7a-ed839b0c90cd', tool_call_id='call_r5UlSwHKQcWDHx6LrttnqE56')]}}

    {'agent': {'messages': [AIMessage(content='Alice In Chains has 11 albums.', response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 9, 'prompt_tokens': 665, 'total_tokens': 674}, 'model_name': 'gpt-3.5-turbo', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_3b956da36b', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-f804eaab-9812-4fb3-ae8b-280af8594ac6-0')]}}
    ----
    

As we can see, the agent used the `search_proper_nouns` tool in order to check how to correctly query the database for this specific artist.

# How to do query validation as part of SQL question-answering

Perhaps the most error-prone part of any SQL chain or agent is writing valid and safe SQL queries. In this guide we'll go over some strategies for validating our queries and handling invalid queries.

We will cover: 

1. Appending a "query validator" step to the query generation;
2. Prompt engineering to reduce the incidence of errors.

## Setup

First, get required packages and set environment variables:


```python
%pip install --upgrade --quiet  langchain langchain-community langchain-openai
```


```python
# Uncomment the below to use LangSmith. Not required.
# import os
# os.environ["LANGCHAIN_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass()
# os.environ["LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2"] = "true"
```

The below example will use a SQLite connection with Chinook database. Follow [these installation steps](https://database.guide/2-sample-databases-sqlite/) to create `Chinook.db` in the same directory as this notebook:

* Save [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lerocha/chinook-database/master/ChinookDatabase/DataSources/Chinook_Sqlite.sql) as `Chinook_Sqlite.sql`
* Run `sqlite3 Chinook.db`
* Run `.read Chinook_Sqlite.sql`
* Test `SELECT * FROM Artist LIMIT 10;`

Now, `Chinhook.db` is in our directory and we can interface with it using the SQLAlchemy-driven `SQLDatabase` class:


```python
from langchain_community.utilities import SQLDatabase

db = SQLDatabase.from_uri("sqlite:///Chinook.db")
print(db.dialect)
print(db.get_usable_table_names())
print(db.run("SELECT * FROM Artist LIMIT 10;"))
```

    sqlite
    ['Album', 'Artist', 'Customer', 'Employee', 'Genre', 'Invoice', 'InvoiceLine', 'MediaType', 'Playlist', 'PlaylistTrack', 'Track']
    [(1, 'AC/DC'), (2, 'Accept'), (3, 'Aerosmith'), (4, 'Alanis Morissette'), (5, 'Alice In Chains'), (6, 'Antônio Carlos Jobim'), (7, 'Apocalyptica'), (8, 'Audioslave'), (9, 'BackBeat'), (10, 'Billy Cobham')]
    

## Query checker

Perhaps the simplest strategy is to ask the model itself to check the original query for common mistakes. Suppose we have the following SQL query chain:

import ChatModelTabs from "@theme/ChatModelTabs";

<ChatModelTabs customVarName="llm" />



```python
# | output: false
# | echo: false

from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI()
```


```python
from langchain.chains import create_sql_query_chain

chain = create_sql_query_chain(llm, db)
```

And we want to validate its outputs. We can do so by extending the chain with a second prompt and model call:


```python
from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

system = """Double check the user's {dialect} query for common mistakes, including:
- Using NOT IN with NULL values
- Using UNION when UNION ALL should have been used
- Using BETWEEN for exclusive ranges
- Data type mismatch in predicates
- Properly quoting identifiers
- Using the correct number of arguments for functions
- Casting to the correct data type
- Using the proper columns for joins

If there are any of the above mistakes, rewrite the query.
If there are no mistakes, just reproduce the original query with no further commentary.

Output the final SQL query only."""
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [("system", system), ("human", "{query}")]
).partial(dialect=db.dialect)
validation_chain = prompt | llm | StrOutputParser()

full_chain = {"query": chain} | validation_chain
```


```python
query = full_chain.invoke(
    {
        "question": "What's the average Invoice from an American customer whose Fax is missing since 2003 but before 2010"
    }
)
print(query)
```

    SELECT AVG(i.Total) AS AverageInvoice
    FROM Invoice i
    JOIN Customer c ON i.CustomerId = c.CustomerId
    WHERE c.Country = 'USA'
    AND c.Fax IS NULL
    AND i.InvoiceDate >= '2003-01-01' 
    AND i.InvoiceDate < '2010-01-01'
    

Note how we can see both steps of the chain in the [Langsmith trace](https://smith.langchain.com/public/8a743295-a57c-4e4c-8625-bc7e36af9d74/r).


```python
db.run(query)
```




    '[(6.632999999999998,)]'



The obvious downside of this approach is that we need to make two model calls instead of one to generate our query. To get around this we can try to perform the query generation and query check in a single model invocation:


```python
system = """You are a {dialect} expert. Given an input question, create a syntactically correct {dialect} query to run.
Unless the user specifies in the question a specific number of examples to obtain, query for at most {top_k} results using the LIMIT clause as per {dialect}. You can order the results to return the most informative data in the database.
Never query for all columns from a table. You must query only the columns that are needed to answer the question. Wrap each column name in double quotes (") to denote them as delimited identifiers.
Pay attention to use only the column names you can see in the tables below. Be careful to not query for columns that do not exist. Also, pay attention to which column is in which table.
Pay attention to use date('now') function to get the current date, if the question involves "today".

Only use the following tables:
{table_info}

Write an initial draft of the query. Then double check the {dialect} query for common mistakes, including:
- Using NOT IN with NULL values
- Using UNION when UNION ALL should have been used
- Using BETWEEN for exclusive ranges
- Data type mismatch in predicates
- Properly quoting identifiers
- Using the correct number of arguments for functions
- Casting to the correct data type
- Using the proper columns for joins

Use format:

First draft: <<FIRST_DRAFT_QUERY>>
Final answer: <<FINAL_ANSWER_QUERY>>
"""
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [("system", system), ("human", "{input}")]
).partial(dialect=db.dialect)

    You are a [33;1m[1;3m{dialect}[0m expert. Given an input question, create a syntactically correct [33;1m[1;3m{dialect}[0m query to run.
    Unless the user specifies in the question a specific number of examples to obtain, query for at most [33;1m[1;3m{top_k}[0m results using the LIMIT clause as per [33;1m[1;3m{dialect}[0m. You can order the results to return the most informative data in the database.
    Never query for all columns from a table. You must query only the columns that are needed to answer the question. Wrap each column name in double quotes (") to denote them as delimited identifiers.
    Pay attention to use only the column names you can see in the tables below. Be careful to not query for columns that do not exist. Also, pay attention to which column is in which table.
    Pay attention to use date('now') function to get the current date, if the question involves "today".
    
    Only use the following tables:
    [33;1m[1;3m{table_info}[0m
    
    Write an initial draft of the query. Then double check the [33;1m[1;3m{dialect}[0m query for common mistakes, including:
    - Using NOT IN with NULL values
    - Using UNION when UNION ALL should have been used
    - Using BETWEEN for exclusive ranges
    - Data type mismatch in predicates
    - Properly quoting identifiers
    - Using the correct number of arguments for functions
    - Casting to the correct data type

## Human-in-the-loop

In some cases our data is sensitive enough that we never want to execute a SQL query without a human approving it first. Head to the [Tool use: Human-in-the-loop](/docs/how_to/tools_human) page to learn how to add a human-in-the-loop to any tool, chain or agent.

## Error handling

At some point, the model will make a mistake and craft an invalid SQL query. Or an issue will arise with our database. Or the model API will go down. We'll want to add some error handling behavior to our chains and agents so that we fail gracefully in these situations, and perhaps even automatically recover. To learn about error handling with tools, head to the [Tool use: Error handling](/docs/how_to/tools_error) page.

## Images Interpolation with Stable Diffusion

_Authored by: [Rustam Akimov](https://github.com/AkiRusProd)_

This notebook shows how to use Stable Diffusion to interpolate between images.  Image interpolation using Stable Diffusion is the process of creating intermediate images that smoothly transition from one given image to another, using a generative model based on diffusion.         

Here are some various use cases for image interpolation with Stable Diffusion:
- Data Augmentation: Stable Diffusion can augment training data for machine learning models by generating synthetic images that lie between existing data points. This can improve the generalization and robustness of machine learning models, especially in tasks like image generation, classification or object detection.   
- Product Design and Prototyping: Stable Diffusion can aid in product design by generating variations of product designs or prototypes with subtle differences. This can be useful for exploring design alternatives, conducting user studies, or visualizing design iterations before committing to physical prototypes.       
- Content Generation for Media Production: In media production, such as film and video editing, Stable Diffusion can be used to generate intermediate frames between key frames, enabling smoother transitions and enhancing visual storytelling. This can save time and resources compared to manual frame-by-frame editing.

In the context of image interpolation, Stable Diffusion models are often used to navigate through a high-dimensional latent space. Each dimension represents a specific feature that has been learned by the model. By walking through this latent space and interpolating between different latent representations of images, the model is able to generate a sequence of intermediate images which show a smooth transition between the original images. There are two types of latents in stable diffusion: prompt latents and image latents.      

Latent space walking involves moving through a latent space along a path defined by two or more points (representing images). By carefully selecting these points and the path between them, it is possible to control the features of the generated images, such as style, content, and other visual aspects.      

In this Notebook, we will explore examples of image interpolation using Stable Diffusion and demonstrate how latent space walking can be implemented and utilized to create smooth transitions between images. We'll provide code snippets and visualizations that illustrate this process in action, allowing for a deeper understanding of how generative models can manipulate and morph image representations in meaningful ways.


First, let's install all the required modules.


```python
!pip install -q diffusers transformers xformers accelerate
!pip install -q numpy scipy ftfy Pillow
```

Import modules


```python
import torch
import numpy as np
import os

import time

from PIL import Image
from IPython import display as IPdisplay
from tqdm.auto import tqdm

from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
from diffusers import (
    DDIMScheduler,
    PNDMScheduler,
    LMSDiscreteScheduler,
    DPMSolverMultistepScheduler,
    EulerAncestralDiscreteScheduler,
    EulerDiscreteScheduler,
)
from transformers import logging

logging.set_verbosity_error()
```

Let's check if CUDA is available.





```python
print(torch.cuda.is_available())

device = torch.device("cuda") if torch.cuda.is_available() else torch.device("cpu")
```

These settings are used to optimize the performance of PyTorch models on CUDA-enabled GPUs, especially when using mixed precision training or inference, which can be beneficial in terms of speed and memory usage.

```python
torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = True
torch.backends.cuda.matmul.allow_tf32 = True
```

### Model

The [`runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5`](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5) model and the [`LMSDiscreteScheduler`](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/en/api/schedulers/lms_discrete) scheduler were chosen to generate images. Despite being an older technology, it continues to enjoy popularity due to its fast performance, minimal memory requirements, and the availability of numerous community fine-tuned models built on top of SD1.5. However, you are free to experiment with other models and schedulers to compare the results.


```python
model_name_or_path = "runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5"

scheduler = LMSDiscreteScheduler(beta_start=0.00085, beta_end=0.012, beta_schedule="scaled_linear", num_train_timesteps=1000)


pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(
    model_name_or_path,
    scheduler=scheduler,
    torch_dtype=torch.float32,
).to(device)

# Disable image generation progress bar, we'll display our own
pipe.set_progress_bar_config(disable=True)
```

These methods are designed to reduce the memory consumed by the GPU. If you have enough VRAM, you can skip this cell.   

More detailed information can be found here: https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/en/optimization/opt_overview     
In particular, information about the following methods can be found here: https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/memory



```python
# Offloading the weights to the CPU and only loading them on the GPU can reduce memory consumption to less than 3GB.
pipe.enable_model_cpu_offload()

# Tighter ordering of memory tensors.
pipe.unet.to(memory_format=torch.channels_last)

# Decoding large batches of images with limited VRAM or batches with 32 images or more by decoding the batches of latents one image at a time.
pipe.enable_vae_slicing()

# Splitting the image into overlapping tiles, decoding the tiles, and then blending the outputs together to compose the final image. 
pipe.enable_vae_tiling()

# Using Flash Attention; If you have PyTorch >= 2.0 installed, you should not expect a speed-up for inference when enabling xformers.
pipe.enable_xformers_memory_efficient_attention()

```

The `display_images` function converts a list of image arrays into a GIF, saves it to a specified path and returns the GIF object for display. It names the GIF file using the current time and handles any errors by printing them out.


```python
def display_images(images, save_path):
    try:
        # Convert each image in the 'images' list from an array to an Image object.
        images = [
            Image.fromarray(np.array(image[0], dtype=np.uint8)) for image in images
        ]

        # Generate a file name based on the current time, replacing colons with hyphens
        # to ensure the filename is valid for file systems that don't allow colons.
        filename = (
            time.strftime("%H:%M:%S", time.localtime())
            .replace(":", "-")
        )
        # Save the first image in the list as a GIF file at the 'save_path' location.
        # The rest of the images in the list are added as subsequent frames to the GIF.
        # The GIF will play each frame for 100 milliseconds and will loop indefinitely.
        images[0].save(
            f"{save_path}/{filename}.gif",
            save_all=True,
            append_images=images[1:],
            duration=100,
            loop=0,
        )
    except Exception as e:
        # If there is an error during the process, print the exception message.
        print(e)

    # Return the saved GIF as an IPython display object so it can be displayed in a notebook.
    return IPdisplay.Image(f"{save_path}/{filename}.gif")
```

### Generation parameters


* `seed`: This variable is used to set a specific random seed for reproducibility.      
* `generator`: This is set to a PyTorch random number generator object if a seed is provided, otherwise it is None. It ensures that the operations using it have reproducible outcomes.     
* `guidance_scale`: This parameter controls the extent to which the model should follow the prompt in text-to-image generation tasks, with higher values leading to stronger adherence to the prompt.       
* `num_inference_steps`: This specifies the number of steps the model takes to generate an image. More steps can lead to a higher quality image but take longer to generate.        
* `num_interpolation_steps`: This determines the number of steps used when interpolating between two points in the latent space, affecting the smoothness of transitions in generated       animations.        
* `height`: The height of the generated images in pixels.       
* `width`: The width of the generated images in pixels.     
* `save_path`: The file system path where the generated gifs will be saved.       


```python
# The seed is set to "None", because we want different results each time we run the generation.
seed = None

if seed is not None:
    generator = torch.manual_seed(seed)
else:
    generator = None

# The guidance scale is set to its normal range (7 - 10).
guidance_scale = 8

# The number of inference steps was chosen empirically to generate an acceptable picture within an acceptable time.
num_inference_steps = 15

# The higher you set this value, the smoother the interpolations will be. However, the generation time will increase. This value was chosen empirically.
num_interpolation_steps = 30

# I would not recommend less than 512 on either dimension. This is because this model was trained on 512x512 image resolution.
height = 512 
width = 512

# The path where the generated GIFs will be saved
save_path = "/output"

if not os.path.exists(save_path):
    os.makedirs(save_path)

```

### Example 1: Prompt interpolation

In this example, interpolation between positive and negative prompt embeddings allows exploration of space between two conceptual points defined by prompts, potentially leading to variety of images blending characteristics dictated by prompts gradually. In this case, interpolation involves adding scaled deltas to original embeddings, creating a series of new embeddings that will be used later to generate images with smooth transitions between different states based on the original prompt.


![Example 1](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/cookbook-images/resolve/main/sd_interpolation_1.gif)

First of all, we need to tokenize and obtain embeddings for both positive and negative text prompts. The positive prompt guides the image generation towards the desired characteristics, while the negative prompt steers it away from unwanted features.


```python
# The text prompt that describes the desired output image.
prompt = "Epic shot of Sweden, ultra detailed lake with an ren dear, nostalgic vintage, ultra cozy and inviting, wonderful light atmosphere, fairy, little photorealistic, digital painting, sharp focus, ultra cozy and inviting, wish to be there. very detailed, arty, should rank high on youtube for a dream trip."
# A negative prompt that can be used to steer the generation away from certain features; here, it is empty.
negative_prompt = "poorly drawn,cartoon, 2d, disfigured, bad art, deformed, poorly drawn, extra limbs, close up, b&w, weird colors, blurry"

# The step size for the interpolation in the latent space.
step_size = 0.001

# Tokenizing and encoding the prompt into embeddings.
prompt_tokens = pipe.tokenizer(
    prompt,
    padding="max_length",
    max_length=pipe.tokenizer.model_max_length,
    truncation=True,
    return_tensors="pt",
)
prompt_embeds = pipe.text_encoder(prompt_tokens.input_ids.to(device))[0]


# Tokenizing and encoding the negative prompt into embeddings.
if negative_prompt is None:
    negative_prompt = [""]

negative_prompt_tokens = pipe.tokenizer(
    negative_prompt,
    padding="max_length",
    max_length=pipe.tokenizer.model_max_length,
    truncation=True,
    return_tensors="pt",
)
negative_prompt_embeds = pipe.text_encoder(negative_prompt_tokens.input_ids.to(device))[0]
```

Now let's look at the code part that generates a random initial vector using a normal distribution that is structured to match the dimensions expected by the diffusion model (UNet). This allows for the reproducibility of the results by optionally using a random number generator. After creating the initial vector, the code performs a series of interpolations between the two embeddings (positive and negative prompts), by incrementally adding a small step size for each iteration. The results are stored in a list named "walked_embeddings".


```python
# Generating initial latent vectors from a random normal distribution, with the option to use a generator for reproducibility.
latents = torch.randn(
    (1, pipe.unet.config.in_channels, height // 8, width // 8),
    generator=generator,
)

walked_embeddings = []

# Interpolating between embeddings for the given number of interpolation steps.
for i in range(num_interpolation_steps):
    walked_embeddings.append(
        [prompt_embeds + step_size * i, negative_prompt_embeds + step_size * i]
    )
```

Finally, let's generate a series of images based on interpolated embeddings and then displaying these images. We'll iterate over an array of embeddings, using each to generate an image with specified characteristics like height, width, and other parameters relevant to image generation. Then we'll collect these images into a list. Once generation is complete we'll call the `display_image` function to save and display these images as GIF at a given save path.


```python
# Generating images using the interpolated embeddings.
images = []
for latent in tqdm(walked_embeddings):
    images.append(
        pipe(
            height=height,
            width=width,
            num_images_per_prompt=1,
            prompt_embeds=latent[0],
            negative_prompt_embeds=latent[1],
            num_inference_steps=num_inference_steps,
            guidance_scale=guidance_scale,
            generator=generator,
            latents=latents,
        ).images
    )

# Display of saved generated images.
display_images(images, save_path)
```

### Example 2: Diffusion latents interpolation for a single prompt
Unlike the first example, in this one, we are performing interpolation between the two embeddings of the diffusion model itself, not the prompts. Please note that in this case, we use the slerp function for interpolation. However, there is nothing stopping us from adding a constant value to one embedding instead.


![Example 2](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/cookbook-images/resolve/main/sd_interpolation_2.gif)

The function presented below stands for Spherical Linear Interpolation. It is a method of interpolation on the surface of a sphere. This function is commonly used in computer graphics to animate rotations in a smooth manner and can also be used to interpolate between high-dimensional data points in machine learning, such as latent vectors used in generative models.       

The source is from Andrej Karpathy's gist: https://gist.github.com/karpathy/00103b0037c5aaea32fe1da1af553355.        
A more detailed explanation of this method can be found at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slerp.


```python
def slerp(v0, v1, num, t0=0, t1=1):
    v0 = v0.detach().cpu().numpy()
    v1 = v1.detach().cpu().numpy()

    def interpolation(t, v0, v1, DOT_THRESHOLD=0.9995):
        """helper function to spherically interpolate two arrays v1 v2"""
        dot = np.sum(v0 * v1 / (np.linalg.norm(v0) * np.linalg.norm(v1)))
        if np.abs(dot) > DOT_THRESHOLD:
            v2 = (1 - t) * v0 + t * v1
        else:
            theta_0 = np.arccos(dot)
            sin_theta_0 = np.sin(theta_0)
            theta_t = theta_0 * t
            sin_theta_t = np.sin(theta_t)
            s0 = np.sin(theta_0 - theta_t) / sin_theta_0
            s1 = sin_theta_t / sin_theta_0
            v2 = s0 * v0 + s1 * v1
        return v2

    t = np.linspace(t0, t1, num)

    v3 = torch.tensor(np.array([interpolation(t[i], v0, v1) for i in range(num)]))

    return v3
```


```python
# The text prompt that describes the desired output image.
prompt = "Sci-fi digital painting of an alien landscape with otherworldly plants, strange creatures, and distant planets."
# A negative prompt that can be used to steer the generation away from certain features.
negative_prompt = "poorly drawn,cartoon, 3d, disfigured, bad art, deformed, poorly drawn, extra limbs, close up, b&w, weird colors, blurry"

# Generating initial latent vectors from a random normal distribution. In this example two latent vectors are generated, which will serve as start and end points for the interpolation.
# These vectors are shaped to fit the input requirements of the diffusion model's U-Net architecture.
latents = torch.randn(
    (2, pipe.unet.config.in_channels, height // 8, width // 8),
    generator=generator,
)

# Getting our latent embeddings
interpolated_latents = slerp(latents[0], latents[1], num_interpolation_steps)

# Generating images using the interpolated embeddings.
images = []
for latent_vector in tqdm(interpolated_latents):
    images.append(
        pipe(
            prompt,
            height=height,
            width=width,
            negative_prompt=negative_prompt,
            num_images_per_prompt=1,
            num_inference_steps=num_inference_steps,
            guidance_scale=guidance_scale,
            generator=generator,
            latents=latent_vector[None, ...],
        ).images
    )

# Display of saved generated images.
display_images(images, save_path)
```

### Example 3: Interpolation between multiple prompts

In contrast to the first example, where we moved away from a single prompt, in this example, we will be interpolating between any number of prompts. To do so, we will take consecutive pairs of prompts and create smooth transitions between them. Then, we will combine the interpolations of these consecutive pairs, and instruct the model to generate images based on them. For interpolation we will use the slerp function, as in the second example.

![Example 3](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/cookbook-images/resolve/main/sd_interpolation_3.gif)

Once again, let's tokenize and obtain embeddings but this time for multiple positive and negative text prompts.


```python
# Text prompts that describes the desired output image.
prompts = [
    "A cute dog in a beautiful field of lavander colorful flowers everywhere, perfect lighting, leica summicron 35mm f2.0, kodak portra 400, film grain",
    "A cute cat in a beautiful field of lavander colorful flowers everywhere, perfect lighting, leica summicron 35mm f2.0, kodak portra 400, film grain",
]
# Negative prompts that can be used to steer the generation away from certain features.
negative_prompts = [
    "poorly drawn,cartoon, 2d, sketch, cartoon, drawing, anime, disfigured, bad art, deformed, poorly drawn, extra limbs, close up, b&w, weird colors, blurry",
    "poorly drawn,cartoon, 2d, sketch, cartoon, drawing, anime, disfigured, bad art, deformed, poorly drawn, extra limbs, close up, b&w, weird colors, blurry",
]

# NOTE: The number of prompts must match the number of negative prompts

batch_size = len(prompts)

# Tokenizing and encoding prompts into embeddings.
prompts_tokens = pipe.tokenizer(
    prompts,
    padding="max_length",
    max_length=pipe.tokenizer.model_max_length,
    truncation=True,
    return_tensors="pt",
)
prompts_embeds = pipe.text_encoder(
    prompts_tokens.input_ids.to(device)
)[0]

# Tokenizing and encoding negative prompts into embeddings.
if negative_prompts is None:
    negative_prompts = [""] * batch_size

negative_prompts_tokens = pipe.tokenizer(
    negative_prompts,
    padding="max_length",
    max_length=pipe.tokenizer.model_max_length,
    truncation=True,
    return_tensors="pt",
)
negative_prompts_embeds = pipe.text_encoder(
    negative_prompts_tokens.input_ids.to(device)
)[0]
```

As stated earlier, we will take consecutive pairs of prompts and create smooth transitions between them with `slerp` function.


```python
# Generating initial U-Net latent vectors from a random normal distribution.
latents = torch.randn(
    (1, pipe.unet.config.in_channels, height // 8, width // 8),
    generator=generator,
)

# Interpolating between embeddings pairs for the given number of interpolation steps.
interpolated_prompt_embeds = []
interpolated_negative_prompts_embeds = []
for i in range(batch_size - 1):
    interpolated_prompt_embeds.append(
        slerp(
            prompts_embeds[i],
            prompts_embeds[i + 1],
            num_interpolation_steps
        )
    )
    interpolated_negative_prompts_embeds.append(
        slerp(
            negative_prompts_embeds[i],
            negative_prompts_embeds[i + 1],
            num_interpolation_steps,
        )
    )

interpolated_prompt_embeds = torch.cat(
    interpolated_prompt_embeds, dim=0
).to(device)

interpolated_negative_prompts_embeds = torch.cat(
    interpolated_negative_prompts_embeds, dim=0
).to(device)
```

Finally, we need to generate images based on the embeddings.


```python
# Generating images using the interpolated embeddings.
images = []
for prompt_embeds, negative_prompt_embeds in tqdm(
    zip(interpolated_prompt_embeds, interpolated_negative_prompts_embeds),
    total=len(interpolated_prompt_embeds),
):
    images.append(
        pipe(
            height=height,
            width=width,
            num_images_per_prompt=1,
            prompt_embeds=prompt_embeds[None, ...],
            negative_prompt_embeds=negative_prompt_embeds[None, ...],
            num_inference_steps=num_inference_steps,
            guidance_scale=guidance_scale,
            generator=generator,
            latents=latents,
        ).images
    )

# Display of saved generated images.
display_images(images, save_path)
```

### Example 4: Circular walk through the diffusion latent space for a single prompt

This example was taken from: https://keras.io/examples/generative/random_walks_with_stable_diffusion/       

Let's imagine that we have two noise components, which we'll call x and y. We start by moving from 0 to 2π and at each step we add the cosine of x and the sine of y to the result. Using this approach, at the end of our movement we end up with the same noise values ​​that we started with. This means that vectors end up turning into themselves, ending our movement.



![Example 4](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/cookbook-images/resolve/main/sd_interpolation_4.gif)


```python
# The text prompt that describes the desired output image.
prompt = "Beautiful sea sunset, warm light, Aivazovsky style"
# A negative prompt that can be used to steer the generation away from certain features
negative_prompt = "picture frames"

# Generating initial latent vectors from a random normal distribution to create a loop interpolation between them.
latents = torch.randn(
    (2, 1, pipe.unet.config.in_channels, height // 8, width // 8),
    generator=generator,
)


# Calculation of looped embeddings
walk_noise_x = latents[0].to(device)
walk_noise_y = latents[1].to(device)

# Walking on a trigonometric circle
walk_scale_x = torch.cos(torch.linspace(0, 2, num_interpolation_steps) * np.pi).to(
    device
)
walk_scale_y = torch.sin(torch.linspace(0, 2, num_interpolation_steps) * np.pi).to(
    device
)

# Applying interpolation to noise
noise_x = torch.tensordot(walk_scale_x, walk_noise_x, dims=0)
noise_y = torch.tensordot(walk_scale_y, walk_noise_y, dims=0)

circular_latents = noise_x + noise_y

# Generating images using the interpolated embeddings.
images = []
for latent_vector in tqdm(circular_latents):
    images.append(
        pipe(
            prompt,
            height=height,
            width=width,
            negative_prompt=negative_prompt,
            num_images_per_prompt=1,
            num_inference_steps=num_inference_steps,
            guidance_scale=guidance_scale,
            generator=generator,
            latents=latent_vector,
        ).images
    )

# Display of saved generated images.
display_images(images, save_path)
```

## Next Steps       
Moving forward, you can explore various parameters such as guidance scale, seed, and number of interpolation steps to observe how they affect the generated images. Additionally, consider trying out different prompts and schedulers to further enhance your results. Another valuable step would be to implement linear interpolation (`linspace`) instead of spherical linear interpolation (`slerp`) and compare the results to gain deeper insights into the interpolation process.

## Overview

The objective is to demonstrate how to perform semantic search in BigQuery using Vector Search, including:


*   Completing setup steps for accessing Vertex AI from BigQuery
*   Creating a remote model in BigQuery
*   Generating text embedding using the remote model
*   Creating a vector index to optimize the semantic search
*   Performing semantic search using `VECTOR_SEARCH` function in BigQuery


## About the dataset

We are going to use Stack Overflow public dataset available in BigQuery. The data is an archive of Stack Overflow posts, votes, tags and badges.

The dataset can be accessed [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery(cameo:product/stack-exchange/stack-overflow)).

## Services and Costs

This tutorial uses the following Google Cloud data analytics and ML services, they are billable components of Google Cloud:

* BigQuery & BigQuery ML [(pricing)](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing)
* Vertex AI API [(pricing)](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/pricing)

Use the [Pricing Calculator](https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator/) to generate a cost estimate based on your projected usage.


# Setup steps for accessing Vertex AI models from BigQuery

## Enable the Vertex AI and BigQuery Connection APIs


```
!gcloud services enable aiplatform.googleapis.com bigqueryconnection.googleapis.com
```

## Create a Cloud resource connection
You can learn more about Cloud resource connection [here](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/create-cloud-resource-connection)


```
!bq mk --connection --location=us \
    --connection_type=CLOUD_RESOURCE vertex_conn
```

## Grant the "Vertex AI User" role to the service account used by the Cloud resource connection



```
SERVICE_ACCT = !bq show --format=prettyjson --connection us.vertex_conn | grep "serviceAccountId" | cut -d '"' -f 4
SERVICE_ACCT_EMAIL = SERVICE_ACCT[-1]
```


```
import os

PROJECT_ID = os.environ["GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT"]
!gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding --format=none $PROJECT_ID --member=serviceAccount:$SERVICE_ACCT_EMAIL --role=roles/aiplatform.user
```

# Create the remote model in BigQuery ML

## Create a new dataset named `'bigquery_demo'`


```
%%bigquery
CREATE SCHEMA
  `bigquery_demo` OPTIONS (location = 'US');
```

## Create the remote model for Text Embedding in BigQuery ML
Text embeddings model converts textual data into numerical vectors.These vector representations are designed to capture the semantic meaning and context of the words they represent.To generate embeddings we are using `text-embedding-004` model, which is one of the text embedding models available on Vertex AI platform.

You can learn more about Embeddings APIs [here](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/embeddings)

Note: If you encounter a permission error while accessing or using the endpoint for the service account, please wait a minute and try again.


```
%%bigquery
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `bigquery_demo.text_embedding_004`
REMOTE WITH CONNECTION `us.vertex_conn`
OPTIONS (endpoint = 'text-embedding-004')
```

# Prepare the dataset for semantic search
Semantic search is a technology that interprets the meaning of words and phrases.

## Generate text embeddings for title and body associated with Stack Overflow questions

For our use case we are going to use `title` and `body` fields from the Stack Overflow `posts_questions` table to generate text embeddings and perform semantic search using the `VECTOR_SEARCH` function.

Note: To limit costs for this demo, we'll use the top 10,000 iOS-related posts.


```
%%bigquery
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE
  `bigquery_demo.posts_questions_embedding` AS
SELECT
  *
FROM
  ML.GENERATE_EMBEDDING( MODEL `bigquery_demo.text_embedding_004`,
    (
    SELECT
      id,
      title,
      body,
      CONCAT (title, body ) AS CONTENT
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`
    WHERE
      tags LIKE '%ios%'
    ORDER BY
      view_Count DESC
    LIMIT
      10000 ),
    STRUCT ( TRUE AS flatten_json_output,
      'SEMANTIC_SIMILARITY' AS task_type ) );
```

Let's now check the new table containing the embedding fields.


```
%%bigquery
SELECT * FROM `bigquery_demo.posts_questions_embedding` LIMIT 100;
```

## Create Vector Index on the embeddings to help with efficient semantic search
A vector index is a data structure designed to let the `VECTOR_SEARCH` function perform a more efficient vector search of embeddings.You can learn more about vector index [here](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/vector-index).


```
%%bigquery
  CREATE OR REPLACE VECTOR INDEX ix_posts_questions
  ON
  `bigquery_demo.posts_questions_embedding` (ml_generate_embedding_result) OPTIONS(index_type = 'IVF',
    distance_type = 'COSINE',
    ivf_options = '{"num_lists":500}');
```

## Verify vector index creation

Note: The vector index is populated asynchronously.You can check whether the index is ready to be used by querying the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.VECTOR_INDEXES` view and verifying that the `coverage_percentage` column value is greater than 0 and the `last_refresh_time` column value isn't `NULL`.


```
%%bigquery
SELECT
  table_name,
  index_name,
  index_status,
  coverage_percentage,
  last_refresh_time,
  disable_reason
FROM
  `bigquery_demo.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.VECTOR_INDEXES`;
```

# Perform semantic search

Using text embeddings to perform similarity search on a new question

## Match input question text to existing question's using vector search
Now let's perform a semantic search using the `VECTOR_SEARCH` function to find the top 5 closest results in our `posts_questions_embedding` table to a given question.


```
%%bigquery
SELECT
  query.query as input_question,
  base.id matching_question_id,
  base.title as matching_question_title,
  base.content as matching_question_content ,
  distance,
FROM
  VECTOR_SEARCH( TABLE `bigquery_demo.posts_questions_embedding`,
    'ml_generate_embedding_result',
    (
    SELECT
      ml_generate_embedding_result,
      content AS query
    FROM
      ML.GENERATE_EMBEDDING( MODEL `bigquery_demo.text_embedding_004`,
        (
        SELECT
          'Why does my iOS app crash with a low memory warning despite minimal memory usage?' AS content) ) ),
    top_k => 5,
    OPTIONS => '{"fraction_lists_to_search": 0.10}')
ORDER BY
  distance ASC ;
```

Summary: The results demonstrate that `VECTOR_SEARCH` effectively identified the top 5 most similar questions.You can use this same approach to implement semantic search in BigQuery on any dataset.

# Cleaning up

To clean up all Google Cloud resources used in this project, you can [delete the Google Cloud project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#shutting_down_projects) you used for the tutorial.

Otherwise, you can delete the individual resources you created in this tutorial by uncommenting the below:


```
#
# !bq rm -r -f $PROJECT_ID:bigquery_demo
# !bq rm --connection --project_id=$PROJECT_ID --location=us vertex_conn
#
```

#Wrap up

In this you have seen an example of how to integrate BQML with Vertex AI LLMs,  how to generate embeddings with `ML.GENERATE_EMBEDDING` and perform semantic search using `VECTOR_SEARCH` in BigQuery.

# StarRocks

>[StarRocks](https://www.starrocks.io/) is a High-Performance Analytical Database.
`StarRocks` is a next-gen sub-second MPP database for full analytics scenarios, including multi-dimensional analytics, real-time analytics and ad-hoc query.

>Usually `StarRocks` is categorized into OLAP, and it has showed excellent performance in [ClickBench — a Benchmark For Analytical DBMS](https://benchmark.clickhouse.com/). Since it has a super-fast vectorized execution engine, it could also be used as a fast vectordb.

Here we'll show how to use the StarRocks Vector Store.

## Setup


```python
%pip install --upgrade --quiet  pymysql langchain-community
```

Set `update_vectordb = False` at the beginning. If there is no docs updated, then we don't need to rebuild the embeddings of docs


```python
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
from langchain_community.document_loaders import (
    DirectoryLoader,
    UnstructuredMarkdownLoader,
)
from langchain_community.vectorstores import StarRocks
from langchain_community.vectorstores.starrocks import StarRocksSettings
from langchain_openai import OpenAI, OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain_text_splitters import TokenTextSplitter

update_vectordb = False
```

    /Users/dirlt/utils/py3env/lib/python3.9/site-packages/requests/__init__.py:102: RequestsDependencyWarning: urllib3 (1.26.7) or chardet (5.1.0)/charset_normalizer (2.0.9) doesn't match a supported version!
      warnings.warn("urllib3 ({}) or chardet ({})/charset_normalizer ({}) doesn't match a supported "
    

## Load docs and split them into tokens

Load all markdown files under the `docs` directory

for starrocks documents, you can clone repo from https://github.com/StarRocks/starrocks, and there is `docs` directory in it.


```python
loader = DirectoryLoader(
    "./docs", glob="**/*.md", loader_cls=UnstructuredMarkdownLoader
)
documents = loader.load()
```

Split docs into tokens, and set `update_vectordb = True` because there are new docs/tokens.


```python
# load text splitter and split docs into snippets of text
text_splitter = TokenTextSplitter(chunk_size=400, chunk_overlap=50)
split_docs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)

# tell vectordb to update text embeddings
update_vectordb = True
```


```python
split_docs[-20]
```




    Document(page_content='Compile StarRocks with Docker\n\nThis topic describes how to compile StarRocks using Docker.\n\nOverview\n\nStarRocks provides development environment images for both Ubuntu 22.04 and CentOS 7.9.

```python
print("# docs  = %d, # splits = %d" % (len(documents), len(split_docs)))
```

    # docs  = 657, # splits = 2802
    

## Create vectordb instance

### Use StarRocks as vectordb


```python
def gen_starrocks(update_vectordb, embeddings, settings):
    if update_vectordb:
        docsearch = StarRocks.from_documents(split_docs, embeddings, config=settings)
    else:
        docsearch = StarRocks(embeddings, settings)
    return docsearch
```

## Convert tokens into embeddings and put them into vectordb

Here we use StarRocks as vectordb, you can configure StarRocks instance via `StarRocksSettings`.

Configuring StarRocks instance is pretty much like configuring mysql instance. You need to specify:
1. host/port
2. username(default: 'root')
3. password(default: '')
4. database(default: 'default')
5. table(default: 'langchain')


```python
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()

# configure starrocks settings(host/port/user/pw/db)
settings = StarRocksSettings()
settings.port = 41003
settings.host = "127.0.0.1"
settings.username = "root"
settings.password = ""
settings.database = "zya"
docsearch = gen_starrocks(update_vectordb, embeddings, settings)

print(docsearch)

update_vectordb = False
```

## Build QA and ask question to it


```python
llm = OpenAI()
qa = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
    llm=llm, chain_type="stuff", retriever=docsearch.as_retriever()
)
query = "is profile enabled by default? if not, how to enable profile?"
resp = qa.run(query)
print(resp)
```

     No, profile is not enabled by default. To enable profile, set the variable `enable_profile` to `true` using the command `set enable_profile = true;`

# How to use Pydantic model as state

<div class="admonition tip">
    <p class="admonition-title">Prerequisites</p>
    <p>
        This guide assumes familiarity with the following:

                    Pydantic

            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
</div>

A [StateGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/graphs/#langgraph.graph.StateGraph) accepts a `state_schema` argument on initialization that specifies the "shape" of the state that the nodes in the graph can access and update.

In our examples, we typically use a python-native `TypedDict` for `state_schema` (or in the case of [MessageGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/graphs/#messagegraph), a [list](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list)), but `state_schema` can be any [type](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#type-objects).

In this how-to guide, we'll see how a [Pydantic BaseModel](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/api/base_model/). can be used for `state_schema` to add run time validation on **inputs**.

              This notebook uses Pydantic v2 <code>BaseModel</code>, which requires <code>langchain-core >= 0.3</code>. Using <code>langchain-core < 0.3</code> will result in errors due to mixing of Pydantic v1 and v2 <code>BaseModels</code>.      
            </li>        
            <li>
                Currently, the `output` of the graph will **NOT** be an instance of a pydantic model.
            </li>
            <li>
                Run-time validation only occurs on **inputs** into nodes, not on the outputs.
            </li>
            <li>
                The validation error trace from pydantic does not show which node the error arises in.
            </li>

## Setup

First we need to install the packages required


```python
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install --quiet -U langgraph
```


```python
import getpass
import os


def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")


_set_env("OPENAI_API_KEY")
```

## Input Validation


```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from typing_extensions import TypedDict

from pydantic import BaseModel


# The overall state of the graph (this is the public state shared across nodes)
class OverallState(BaseModel):
    a: str


def node(state: OverallState):
    return {"a": "goodbye"}


# Build the state graph
builder = StateGraph(OverallState)
builder.add_node(node)  # node_1 is the first node
builder.add_edge(START, "node")  # Start the graph with node_1
builder.add_edge("node", END)  # End the graph after node_1
graph = builder.compile()

# Test the graph with a valid input
graph.invoke({"a": "hello"})
```




    {'a': 'goodbye'}



Invoke the graph with an **invalid** input


```python
try:
    graph.invoke({"a": 123})  # Should be a string
except Exception as e:
    print("An exception was raised because `a` is an integer rather than a string.")
    print(e)
```

    An exception was raised because `a` is an integer rather than a string.
    1 validation error for OverallState
    a
      Input should be a valid string [type=string_type, input_value=123, input_type=int]

## Multiple Nodes

Run-time validation will also work in a multi-node graph. In the example below `bad_node` updates `a` to an integer. 

Because run-time validation occurs on **inputs**, the validation error will occur when `ok_node` is called (not when `bad_node` returns an update to the state which is inconsistent with the schema).


```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from typing_extensions import TypedDict

from pydantic import BaseModel


# The overall state of the graph (this is the public state shared across nodes)
class OverallState(BaseModel):
    a: str


def bad_node(state: OverallState):
    return {
        "a": 123  # Invalid
    }


def ok_node(state: OverallState):
    return {"a": "goodbye"}


# Build the state graph
builder = StateGraph(OverallState)
builder.add_node(bad_node)
builder.add_node(ok_node)
builder.add_edge(START, "bad_node")
builder.add_edge("bad_node", "ok_node")
builder.add_edge("ok_node", END)
graph = builder.compile()

# Test the graph with a valid input
try:
    graph.invoke({"a": "hello"})
except Exception as e:
    print("An exception was raised because bad_node sets `a` to an integer.")
    print(e)
```

    An exception was raised because bad_node sets `a` to an integer.
    1 validation error for OverallState
    a
      Input should be a valid string [type=string_type, input_value=123, input_type=int]
